6224173,"R v COLLINS, John [2017] NSWDC 281","SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: The prisoner John William Collins appears today for sentence in relation to a number of offences committed approximately between 1 February 1979 and 31 December 1980 in relation to a then young male victim, hereinafter to be referred to as XX or ‘the victim’. He also appears for sentence in relation to an offence committed whilst on bail in relation to the matters with which I am concerned relating to the victim from 1979 and 1980. The detail of the charges with which I am concerned and for which the prisoner is to be sentenced today is as follows.
	
	
	Firstly, count 1 on the indictment, to which the prisoner pleaded guilty, alleges an offence committed between 1 February 1979 and 31 December 1980 of indecently assaulting the victim, a male person. This is an offence contrary to s 81 of the Crimes Act 1900 as it then stood which then carried a maximum penalty of five years’ imprisonment. Naturally, it had no standard non-parole period.
	
	
	The second offence on the indictment is an offence allegedly committed or in the indictment between 1 November 1980 and 31 March 1981 at Allawah in the State of New South Wales of the crime of “buggery” upon the victim. This is an offence contrary to s 79 of the Crimes Act 1900. It carries a maximum penalty of 14 years’ imprisonment.
	
	
	There is to be taken into account in relation to count 2, the buggery charge, four offences on a Form 1. The first offence is an indecent assault contrary to s 81 upon the victim committed in the same period of time pleaded in relation to count 1. There is another offence of act of indecency with a male pursuant to s 81A over the same period of time upon the same victim. As I understand it as at 1979 and 1980 the maximum penalty in respect of an offence contrary to s 81A Crimes Act 1900 was two years’ imprisonment. There is a further allegation of buggery pursuant to s 79 Crimes Act committed between 1 January 1981 and 31 March 1981 at Hurstville upon the victim and a further charge of attempted buggery committed between 1 January 1981 and 30 April 1981 at Randwick contrary, according to the Form 1, s 80 Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	The further matter for sentence is an offence of greater contemporaneity. That is an offence of possess child abuse material contrary to s 91A(2) Crimes Act 1900. This offence carries a maximum penalty of ten years’ imprisonment. There is no standard non-parole period. This offence is an offence committed in the pleadings between 27 May 2016 and 12 October 2016. The prisoner was arrested and charged in relation to this matter apparently in January 2017 after I had refused bail on 14 October 2016. The prisoner has been in custody since that latter date and of course all time in custody will be taken into account.
	
	
	The prisoner committed the relevant offence, the facts of which I will outline later, in a period of time which includes the period of time between pleading guilty to the matters on indictment and my refusal of bail on 14 October 2016. I point out in the context of pressing the seriousness of the breach of conditional liberty that this offence was ongoing over a period of time when I was considering whether or not I would revoke or refuse the prisoner bail after his pleas of guilty on the application of the Crown.
	
	
	I do not propose to go into the detail of what occurred, but, in summary, after the prisoner pleaded guilty and the Crown made application for him to be refused bail I spent a number of days, the precise number I do not have a record of at the present time, considering Mr Collins’ situation particularly in light of the circumstances of his mother, as she is described, or his “aunt” and allowed him to be on bail in that period of time to make arrangements for her wellbeing.
	
	
	With regard to the matters of 1979, 1980 and 1981 there is what is called a draft agreed statement of facts before the Court. The document that was actually tendered and received in evidence is signed by the learned Crown Prosecutor, but not signed by the prisoner. There are matters that were raised with me from the outset on behalf of the prisoner, who did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings, of “dispute”. These matters primarily related to not the character of the offending, but the character of the relationship between the prisoner and the victim.
	
	
	The victim was born on 11 March 1970 and the background of his childhood was that he went to Coogee Public School until about year 3 and 4 and played rugby union as I would understand it from the age of six or seven. He played for a team described as “Clovelly” in junior rugby union between 1977 and 1981.
	
	
	The evidence is, in the context of the matters raised on behalf of the prisoner and some independent evidence from the victim’s mother, that the prisoner had an association with the Clovelly club, the victim believing that, at the relevant time the offender committed the offences on indictment and on the Form 1, the prisoner was his coach. There is some independent evidence to establish that the prisoner coached a team in 1977, an under 17 team, but only for one year, although the prisoner may have had a continuing association with the club after that period of time.
	
	
	The significance of this aspect of the purported “dispute” as I would understand it, although it was never expressly addressed in the final submissions, seemed to me to reflect upon the issue of whether the prisoner was in some sort of position of “authority” or held a position of “trust” in respect of his relationship with the victim. Of course, I appreciate even if he was established beyond reasonable doubt to be the victim’s coach at relevant times, issues of “breach of trust and authority” would be matters of debate. But ultimately I have concluded although the prisoner and the victim had a connection dating back to the victim’s association with the Clovelly Rugby Club the evidence available to me, albeit in a draft “agree facts” statement and the like, leaves me with the conclusion that whatever be the character of the circumstances in which they came to know one another at relevant times, the prisoner did not have a position of “authority” nor was in breach of any “relationship of trust” in respect of the victim at relevant times.
	
	
	That is not to say, of course, that the prisoner when the victim was in his presence, particularly occasions that the victim was being driven around Sydney whilst the prisoner went about his job, did not have some responsibility for the care of the victim. That is self-evidently so. I do not believe there is a requirement for me to examine that matter in any greater detail.
	
	
	I hasten to say as will be self-evident when I deal with the legislative matters that are relevant to this sentencing exercise, that at the time of the commission of these offences the character of the offending with which the prisoner was concerned was covered by what can be described now as “primitive” penal provisions. It is quite obvious to anyone who has any understanding of the current state of the Crimes Act that there is a far more sophisticated and detailed array of offences that could have been charged in relation to these matters with identical offending had these offences been committed in recent years.
	
	
	Matters such as being under the authority of a particular person at a relevant time can be circumstances of “aggravation” which would be pleaded as elements of the offence and, of course, we now have a complex provision, s 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which details particular aggravations of criminal conduct and mitigating factors that can be taken into account both in respect of the objective offending and the subjective circumstances of the offender.
	
	
	In sentencing the prisoner at this point of time I am required in retrospect, if it may expressly be stated, the provisions of s 21A to offences which at the time of the offending did not require the consideration of s 21A simply because it did not exist. The precise history of s 21A I need not dilate upon, but the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, hereinafter to be referred to as ‘the Act’, actually became the law in New South Wales shortly after I became a Judge and came into force in 2001.
	
	
	The original act had a form of s 21A, or certainly had a form of s 21A within a few months of the enactment of the original Act, but the current Act in its sophistication and in its detail has evolved from a time around about 2003. But, as I have said, I am required to apply it to all the offending, noting, as I have said earlier, that there are some matters that could not be pleaded as circumstances of aggravation when the offending occurred.
	
	
	It is part of the facts which I accept for the purposes of sentencing the prisoner that the prisoner in his initial contact with the victim developed a relationship with him which commenced with some inappropriate touching. Those matters in themselves were not matters of significance but for, of course, what then followed.
	
	
	Count 1 of the indictment is an allegation of indecent assault on a male and this involves the accused asking the victim at a particular point in their association with one another, in a place that is not described in the facts, to take his shorts and underwear off and the accused touching the victim’s penis for a short time whilst the prisoner was driving his motor vehicle. The prisoner told the victim that it was all right and the victim felt that the prisoner was acting as a type of father figure at that time. I should point out, as I understand the evidence, the victim lived with his mother, but did not have a father at that particular time.
	
	
	The second matter on the Form 1 reflects the next offence in time, as does the third matter on the Form 1. These are allegations of indecent assault and an act of indecency with a male. The next time the prisoner was driving the victim he asked the victim to take his shorts off and rubbed the victim’s penis. As I would understand it, this would be the allegation of indecent assault. While he was doing this he pulled his own football shorts down and exposed his penis to the victim and said to the victim, “Look how big this penis is.” The victim saw the prisoner’s penis and later on is able to say that the accused was circumcised. He says this conduct occurred on two further occasions.
	
	
	There is an alleged contact at Clovelly Public School when the victim was in year 6 which apparently is in some form of dispute, but it is a matter that forms only part of the contextual evidence and is not of itself a matter of great moment.
	
	
	The facts state that after training one night the prisoner asked the victim’s mother if the victim could come to work on his truck with him at the time the prisoner was a truck driver. In this respect there is some dispute, again not the subject of evidence from the prisoner, concerning whether in fact he asked the mother for the victim to come to work with him on the truck or whether the victim in fact of his own motion came to be with the prisoner in the truck. Not attending school when he should have. To my mind this issue is a matter of no moment in proper context.
	
	
	The prisoner is said in the course of their relationship to have often asked the victim to pull his pants down and the prisoner touched his penis. Count 2 is an allegation of buggery. This occurred when the victim and the prisoner were travelling around in the prisoner’s truck. It was during the summer period and the victim remembered driving through the St George area and eventually driving to what, as I understand it, was a horseshoe shaped street where the prisoner parked outside a block of apartments. They went up to the unit block and up the stairs and went into a unit, the ownership of which is not described in the facts.
	
	
	The prisoner asked the victim to come into the bedroom. It would appear that nobody was present at the time. The victim recalls the prisoner looking “scared or nervous”. The bedroom contained female clothing and other female items. The prisoner looked through various drawers and told the victim to sit on the bed. The victim sat on the edge of the bed. The prisoner asked him to move over. He sat next to him. He rubbed the victim’s penis on top of his clothing and then asked him to pull his shorts down. He did this, because he was asked to by the prisoner and he believed the prisoner was acting as a kind of father figure. The prisoner stroked the victim’s penis and pulled his own pants down, exposing an erect penis. He cuddled the victim, played with the victim’s penis and started massaging the victim’s legs and body and tried to turn him over.
	
	
	The victim turned on his stomach so the prisoner would stop touching his penis. The prisoner got on top of him. The prisoner touched the victim’s bottom from behind. The victim turned on his side to see what the prisoner was doing and, naturally enough, the victim was scared as he did not know what the prisoner was doing. The prisoner put his penis between the cheeks of the victim’s bottom and stroked the bottom of the victim with the end of his penis and then inserted his penis into the victim’s anus, thus committing the offence of buggery. The victim reports that this was “the worst pain (he) had ever experienced”. He tried to wrestle away from the prisoner. However, the prisoner continued with the intercourse.
	
	
	The victim, afterwards, was in shock and eventually the victim was allowed from underneath the prisoner. The prisoner did ask the victim a number of times if he was all right but the victim was, to use the word in the statement of facts, “in shock”. The prisoner is said to have tried to comfort him and they eventually went back to the truck without taking anything out of the unit. The prisoner tried to assure the victim over the rest of the afternoon and the victim was dropped off at home. The victim had blood in his excrement and on toilet paper, and had sharp pains in his lower stomach and anus for three days after the offence.
	
	
	There is no evidence before me, and the prisoner has not assisted this Court in any way in this regard, as to the connection the prisoner had with the unit at Kogarah or Rockdale where this offence is said to have occurred. My understanding of the matter is that the prisoner was an inhabitant of the eastern or south-eastern suburbs of Sydney.
	
	
	The victim did not travel with the prisoner for some weeks after this. About a month later, however, the victim was back travelling around with the prisoner in his truck and they eventually one day went to 5 Treacy Street, Hurstville. This was a house identified by the victim after he came forward to police in 2014. The house was identified in 2014. The prisoner, when they came to this address, went in the house. The victim remained in the truck. Eventually the prisoner came out of the house and waved the victim to come in and the victim thought that the prisoner needed someone to help him carry things.
	
	
	Eventually when the victim came into the premises, he found himself in a bedroom and the victim was pushed down to lay down on the bed. The victim was lying next to a window. At this point the prisoner was not wearing a shirt. He took off his clothes and became completely naked; rubbed the victim’s penis through his shorts, removed the shorts and underwear, told the victim to touch his penis, which the victim refused to do, then grabbed the victim by the shoulders and rolled him onto his stomach and placed his penis into the victim’s anus. This was “more painful than the previous time”. The victim describes this as “the worst pain he has ever felt”. The victim again tried to force the prisoner away and the penetration continued for about ten minutes. The victim was eventually able to get free. The victim does not know if the prisoner ejaculated, however, the facts quote, “He did not ejaculate in the victim's anus”.
	
	
	On this occasion when the victim got off the bed, he was crying and his bottom was sore. The prisoner again tried to comfort him. The victim pulled up his pants and rushed out of the door, and the prisoner followed him. It would seem on the facts available to me, although the prisoner sought to comfort the victim, he carried on as if nothing serious had happened. The victim again suffered discomfort, blood excreted from his anus in the days following.
	
	
	On the Form 1 there is another allegation concerned with anal penetration but this allegation is one of attempted buggery. On this occasion the prisoner drove the victim to his “parents” house at Randwick. The prisoner lured the victim into the house on the pretence that he wanted the victim to meet his parents. He told the victim when they went inside the house to go into the first room on the right, which was a bedroom. The prisoner returned after being absent for a period of time and went into the bedroom where the victim was, closed the bedroom door and again the prisoner undressed. He had an erect penis. He pulled the victim’s shorts down past his knees. laid the victim on the bed, stroked his penis, laid on top of him and then tried to insert his penis in the victim’s anus. He tried for some period of time but was unsuccessful in penetrating the victim’s anus. The victim got off the bed eventually, got dressed and tried to leave the house, and eventually the victim was driven home.
	
	
	On this occasion the victim recalls the prisoner did not try to console him as much as he had previously. None of this was reported to the victim’s mother, for obvious reasons.
	
	
	The victim, after this occasion, never travelled with the prisoner on his truck again. Eventually after many, many years of struggle, reflected in the victim impact statement, the conduct of the prisoner having a profound impact upon the victim and his life quality, the victim came forward in July 2014 spoke to a solicitor about the matter and was advised to report the matters to the police. At this time, he also told his wife what had happened.
	
	
	The victim’s mother Ms Morris made a statement to police. She confirmed certain aspects of the victim’s contact with the prisoner, the association of the victim with the prisoner, and the fact that the victim had worked with the prisoner on his truck. She says that the prisoner did not speak to her about this aspect of the matter. The prisoner, when interviewed in relation to these matters, admitted certain aspects of the victim’s story, particularly aspects of his connection with the victim. She, the mother, remembered the victim after the last sexual contact with the prisoner, although she did not know it was sexual conduct but certainly at a time when the victim said he did not want to work with the prisoner anymore, being in a trance-like state. She made inquiries of the prisoner’s mother as to why the prisoner was picking up her son and she reported that the prisoner’s mother said that she would have a word with the prisoner. In August 2014, no doubt with great trepidation, the victim told his mother what had happened to him as a child.
	
	
	The statement of facts also deals with matters of history relating to the prisoner’s indecent treatment of other children subsequent to the offending with which I am concerned. I will go through the prisoner’s criminal history shortly but there was another victim for which the prisoner was sentenced in 1991. That victim was eleven years of age. The victim with whom I am concerned at the relevant times was either nine but more likely ten or eleven, given the generality of some of the particulars. This eleven year old victim was indecently assaulted in particular ways and the prisoner showed the victim a number of pornographic “books”, as they are described.
	
	
	Another victim, for which the prisoner was sentenced in 1991, was nine years of age when he was indecently dealt with by the prisoner.
	
	
	In 2000 the prisoner pleaded guilty to offences relating to a victim who was fourteen years of age, and precise details of that offending are not summarised in the Crown’s statement of facts.
	
	
	I have said earlier that in relation to these matters I have read the victim impact statement. It sets out the history of the matter in terms of context as remembered by the victim and he speaks of the considerable effect upon him of the prisoner’s conduct, the way it has affected his quality of life, his relationship with other males, difficulties he had with his mother and the emotional and physical turmoil that he had suffered as a consequence. He noted that he would wish to get his “life back”, taken from him in the circumstances set out in his victim impact statement, by the conduct of the prisoner.
	
	
	The other offending with which I am concerned is the offending relating to his possession of child abuse material. In respect of that matter, there are two related offences flowing from that offending on a Form 1 by being in possession of child abuse material. The prisoner was in breach of his obligations under the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000, that is a failure to comply with “reporting obligations” as an offence on the Form 1. There is another offence on the Form 1 of disseminating child abuse material over the same period of time, that is, between 27 May 2016 and 18 June 2016. That offence carries a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment when dealt with on indictment. In respect of this matter, there is an agreed statement of facts. It could scarcely be disputed in the context of what is alleged in the facts.
	
	
	With regard to the prisoner’s registration under the Child Protection Register, that occurred after his convictions in 2001. He was reminded of his obligations in relation to that legislation again by police on 20 July 2016. The failure to comply with reporting conditions was the fact that the prisoner had an e-mail address; “bigballs1092@hotmail.com”, that he did not register to police in accordance with his reporting obligations.
	
	
	With regard to the dissemination of child abuse material, police on 18 November 2016 received information that the offender was using a number of aliases or had used a number of aliases to upload images depicting a naked prepubescent male in a sexual position with an adult male to Facebook on 18 June 2016. This image is classified now as category 1 on the Interpol Baseline:
	


“(an image depicting a real prepubescent child and the child is involved in a sex act, witnessing a sex act, or the material is focused/concentrated on the anal or genital region of the child)”.


	
	I just interpose to point out that this is the first case that I have had where this new method of seeking to categorise child abuse material has come before me. It is a relatively recent change in the categorisation of this material. As recently as a few months ago, having dealt with many cases of this type, both Commonwealth and State prosecutions, the categorisation of material followed what I understood to be the CETS categorisation which involved a number of levels of material, from memory now 1 to 6, showing different categories in what I would call ascending seriousness, at least from category 1 through to category 5. Now it is the proposal of the prosecution to produce to courts one of two Interpol ‘Baseline’ categorisations. I am not familiar with what category 2 is but based upon what I have seen in relation to this matter, it will become more common for Judges, or Magistrates in the appropriate case, to view the relevant material to have a clear understanding or even a basic understanding of the category of material. Obviously, the description I have given of “category 1” on the Baseline is so generally worded as to not provide much assistance in understanding precisely what the images are.
	
	
	It was explained to me by the learned Crown Prosecutor that this change by the New South Wales Police, at least, has been brought about by the emotional damage and suffering and impact of viewing this material that police have been subjected to in their hard work and excellent investigative undertakings, pursuing people that possess or disseminate this type of material. What effect the reviewing of this material is going to have on Judges is another issue. It must be said, although it has got nothing to do with this case, I had to view once a thirty minute video of a grown man having penile/vaginal intercourse with a three year old girl, in the knowledge that the little blond-headed boy sitting in the background was to be killed by the man once the film ended. It is a matter that has stuck with me for some period of time. I have an understanding of the impact upon police of this material.
	
	
	It is further said in relation to the dissemination of child abuse material that the prisoner uploaded images depicting either the genitals or the anus of prepubescent males to Facebook on 27 May 2016. Again with this “category 1” to which I refer. These Facebook images were originally reported to the “Cyber Tipline of the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children Unit”, who then reported the images to the AFP for further investigation. Those images have not been brought to my attention.
	
	
	I did, however, see a cross-section of the child abuse material in the possession of the prisoner. The police had received information the prisoner had uploaded forty video files to the Dropbox application, that is:
	


“an application downloaded onto devices so that photos, documents, videos and other files can be backed-up, accessed and shared on all of the user’s devices”.


	
	Police have since examined the fifty video files and found that forty-five of those files were child abuse material that fall into the category 1 on the Interpol Baseline to which I earlier referred. All forty-five video files contain child abuse material depicting prepubescent males involved in sexual acts with an adult male, or another prepubescent male, or with themselves. Some of these prepubescent males were toddlers. The names of those various files, as I understand it, taken from the prisoner’s computer or hard drive, I need not read onto the record. But each of them by their description depict obviously challenging, to say the very least, disturbing and deeply offensive subject matter. One such file, for an example, is titled “Boysuckmancum”. In order to understand the material, I viewed the material in court when the matter was last before me. I placed on the record, after viewing the material, what I had seen. I do not have a transcript of the last proceedings before me but that transcript, I think, fairly, as the Crown and defence acknowledge, set out what I had observed. At this point, all I need say is I saw images of very young children apparently drugged, or at least one child drugged. I saw images of three pubescent or prepubescent boys involved in sexual activity, one with the other, including anal penetration and fellatio. I saw grown men performing fellatio and other sexual acts upon children.
	
	
	Whether this material was paid for by the prisoner or uploaded on some basis where he had access to it through people that he knew, I do not know. It does not really matter very much. It does not matter whether it was paid for or was provided to him for free. But it is clear, as I have said on a number of occasions, and I am sure many other judges have said far more eloquently than I can portray the material, that each of these images, grossly confronting as they are, show a victim, perhaps a victim in another country or another continent, but a victim nevertheless, being debased and abused. It does not matter whether it is a still image or a video image, what we are seeing is only part of the picture. We are denied what has brought the child, in the case of a child being abused, to that position and we know not what has happened to that child after they have been used for the sexual purpose that the video shows. Anyone who viewed that material should, acting reasonably, be deeply, deeply disturbed and upset at that situation. People like this prisoner allow the situation to exist where young people, some very young indeed, are drugged and abused in many ways. How anyone could get any sexual enjoyment or satisfaction out of viewing such material is very difficult to understand.
	
	
	The video files that contain child abuse material were uploaded between 16 July and 12 October 2016. So the prisoner was actively uploading some of this material when he was appearing before me and I was struggling with the issue of whether I should permit him to remain on bail. I must say that, putting aside my view of the correctness of my decision at the time, by placing the prisoner in custody at least to some extent I limited the prisoner’s access to this material and further uploading of the relevant material. The matter was not expressly addressed in submissions by either of the parties, but there can be, in my mind, no doubt that the prisoner’s activities in this regard were interrupted by being refused bail and being placed in custody.
	
	
	The prisoner, it should be pointed out, according to the AFP records, used a number of online aliases to obtain this material. Both the images to Facebook that were uploaded and the forty-five video files that were uploaded to ‘Dropbox’. The prisoner has been linked to these online aliases by the Hotmail account to which I refer, which has been identified by intelligence analysts of the Australian Federal Police as being linked to the prisoner at the address where he lived. The “IP” address which is set out in the facts was used to log into the Hotmail account on various occasions between 16 July and 12 October at his home address, and the relevant account is registered in his name. There is a statement attached setting out some details in relation to that material. I will say more about the objective seriousness of that offending shortly.
	
	
	The prisoner was born on 4 September 1956. It is to be noted that at the time of the commission of the offences in 1980/81 against the victim to whom I earlier referred, the prisoner had two findings of guilt in respect of matters of dishonesty. He was convicted of stealing in April 1975 and bound over for four years, placed under Probation and Parole supervision, and there were four further counts of “larceny” dealt with on the same day in the Sydney District Court for which he was bound over for four years, again subject to Probation and Parole Service supervision. That supervision would have finished in April 1979.
	
	
	He was convicted in the course of the offending with which I am concerned, precisely when in relation to that offending I cannot say, in respect of offences of make false entry and a number of counts for forgery and uttering, which were dealt with in the Local Court. Again, he was given the benefit of a recognisance to be of good behaviour for three years. Some of the offences were dealt with by a sentence of rising of the Court.
	
	
	Certainly I am prepared to accept that he was at the time of the historical offending a person without prior convictions for violence or sexual offending against children. I could not conclude on the basis of findings of guilt in the District Court for larceny that he was necessarily a person of “good character”, although that offending was quite different from the offending with which I am concerned.
	
	
	However, more pertinent to the offending of possessing child abuse material, in terms of the sentencing exercise with which I am concerned, are his subsequent appearances at court. He was convicted at the Bathurst District Court in November 1991 in respect of two offences of committing an act of indecency upon a person under the age of ten years and committing an assault upon a person with an act of indecency and, in respect of each offence, was placed on a recognisance to be of good behaviour for five years.
	
	
	He then was convicted in 1995 for an offence committed in 1994 of “violent disorder” and fined $600. He had further convictions for dishonesty at the Waverley Local Court in December 1995. He was initially sentenced to six months imprisonment for nine counts of larceny as a clerk. He appealed against his conviction. The appeal was dismissed but the learned judge who dealt with him, Judge Gibson QC, substituted for the gaol sentence a recognisance to be of good behaviour for three years.
	
	
	In 1999 he was convicted of a mid range prescribed concentration of alcohol offence, for which he was placed on a recognisance for eighteen months. He was subsequently convicted of other driving offences at the Downing Centre Local Court, not of great moment, although he was driving whilst suspended on different dates.
	
	
	In May of 2000 he was convicted in the Local Court, for reasons best known to the prosecutors at the time, of aggravated indecent assault upon a person under the age of sixteen. Three such counts, as I would understand the matter from the criminal history in respect of which I should say he was placed on a s 9 bond for five years under the Act. In respect of two other counts of aggravated indecent assault of a person under the age of sixteen years he was imprisoned for nine months but that was suspended pursuant to s 12 of the Act. These offences were committed, as I would understand the matter, in March 1999.
	
	
	He was convicted in the Sydney District Court on 21 October 2011 for an offence committed on 17 October 2010 of producing, disseminating and/or possessing child abuse material. For this offence, he was sentenced to twenty-seven months imprisonment, commencing from 14 November 2011 with the non-parole period of twelve months. Thus, as I would understand it, there was a finding of ‘special circumstances’. He was required on release to obey all directions concerning psychiatric treating including medication, he was directed to destroy “DVDs and Dell hard drive and computer”.
	
	
	He had a conviction for failing to comply with reporting conditions relating to the fact that he was a registered sexual offender. That conviction was recorded at the Downing Centre on 7 June 2015, and he was placed on a good behaviour bond for seventeen months, as I would understand it, from that date and to receive counselling, education and other advice from what was called “Probation and Parole” for some period of that bond. As I would understand it, judging from the chronology of the matter, if that bond was entered in June 2015, he would have been subject to that bond at the time of the commission of the offence with which I am concerned of possess child abuse material. I also should note in respect of the appearance at the District Court there were related offences of use carriage service to access child pornography, for which he received concurrent sentences.
	
	
	There is a presentence report from Community Corrections setting out his prior contact with the organisation in its various forms. He is said to have completed the relevant supervision “satisfactorily”.
	
	
	Whilst in custody from 2011, he completed the CUBIT sex offender program and was compliant with supervision. He also was subject to the s 9 bond to which I referred. That purportedly expired on 16 November 2016. It is said by the Community Corrections Service, “His response to this order was consider satisfactory.”
	
	
	Obviously, Community Corrections were not relevantly informed of his offending in respect of the possession of child abuse material with which I am concerned.
	
	
	His background, as is set out in this report and in the psychological report obtained is not controversial. The lady who has prepared a reference for him that he describes as his mother, the person about whose welfare I was so concerned about late last year, is really his aunt. His birth father passed away when he was three years of age and his birth mother died when he was nine years. What impact upon his later development these events and the circumstance of being raised by his aunt and uncle, I cannot say, but he claims a positive upbringing. There is nothing to suggest that anything done by his aunt or uncle of his birth mother or his birth father has directly contributed to his offending.
	
	
	He retains a close relationship with his adoptive mother who is elderly and has many health difficulties. His uncle or adopted father passed away in 1998. According to the history in the Community Corrections Service, he was in a sexual relationship, apparently, with a woman for 12 years, ending in 1991 and has two children, aged 25 and 31. His eldest child, however, is unaware of the matters before the court. His children have not attended court; not that I hold that against him. But they have not been present in these proceedings.
	
	
	He has had various employment since leaving school. I note his criminal history reflects dishonesty towards some employers. He has worked as an accounts clerk which would have given him the opportunity to have committed those offences. I know he worked as a truck driver. He was unemployed for a short period of time before being taken into custody in October last year. He has some modest tertiary qualifications. He is not an abuser of drugs and alcohol, nor are there claimed to be any mental health issues as such in the Community Corrections report.
	
	
	It is known to the Community Corrections Service that he has a history of sexual offending highlighted, or set out, in my view, through his criminal history. He has obviously an attraction to pubescent and pre-pubescent boys. He reported, it would seem candidly to Community Corrections, continuing “sexual attraction to young boys”.
	
	
	He has been referred for an assessment by a Corrective Services psychologist. It was noted in that report, based on the Static S99R ‘risk assessment tool’ that he was found to be at moderate to high range of risk of sexual re-offending. The prisoner showed little contrition in his attitude to the offending which with the court is concerned, particularly, as I would understand it, the offending committed against the victim from the eastern suburbs. He “denied committing the offences”. He claimed that he pleaded “guilty to the offences as part of a plea bargain”.
	
	
	In another statement the Community Corrections report states that as
	
	
	Mr Collins maintained his innocence, “issues of remorse could not be explored”. Clearly, the identified criminogenic need in his case was “sexual offending”.
	
	
	According to the actuarial risks/needs assessment tool used by Community Corrections, he was assessed as a “high risk of re-offending”.
	
	
	I should point out that I have read the report from the Corrective Services psychologist. I do not need to go through the detail of that and the factors that were identified as relevant to the assessment. The psychologist noted continuing “deviant sexual preference”. The prisoner “continued to report sexual attraction to young boys”. It noted also that the prisoner had “very limited social support”. His only pro-social influence was his “mother”.
	
	
	The factors that apparently worked in his favour in the assessment undertaken by the psychologist was that he was able to negotiate a stable relationship for a period of time with, I assume, the mother of his children and his compliance with directions from Community Corrections officers. He will undertake a specialist sexual offender program whilst in custody, one would expect. In fact, he would not be considered for release to parole until he completed that program.
	
	
	A point I want to make, however, about the report produced by Community Corrections, bearing in mind it was prepared on
	
	
	21 November 2016 before the prisoner was charged with the relevant offence, is that it would seem that the psychologist was unaware of the prisoner’s possession and dissemination of child abuse material. What difference that would have made to the assessment is a matter of speculation but it is clearly the case that the prisoner is a real risk, notwithstanding the fact that he had endeavoured to undertake treatment, presumably in accordance with earlier directions of the court in the period of time between 2001 or 2013 when he was released from custody and the time he went back into custody last year.
	
	
	There is a psychologist’s report produced by the defence. It is a very “thin” report in my view. There was limited psychological testing, in my view, compared to many other reports I see including reports I saw this morning. It notes some matters of history that I should just mention.
	
	
	The prisoner had sought assistance from a psychiatrist, he prescribed him testosterone lowering medications and he said that while he was on that medication he did not have any urge to act upon his impulses.
	
	
	I should state that it is to be noted that since his release from custody earlier this century there is no evidence of him committing direct offences towards other children. But, of course, there are offences of possessing child abuse, showing his disturbing interest in sexual activity with children and his very unhealthy interest in the exploitation of young children.
	
	
	He claimed to the psychologist that he was “bisexual”. He told the psychologist that he was no longer permitted to see his grandchild of his daughter due to the charge.
	
	
	He was assessed in relation to matters of depression and anxiety. In my view, undertaking such a test while a person is in custody and having been in custody for six months awaiting a substantial term of imprisonment is an exercise in “stating the obvious”. He shows symptoms of some depression and anxiety but, ultimately, in this particular case, the results reflected him to be within the “normal” range at the present time.
	
	
	It was claimed by the psychologist, without further information, that his history and “symptoms” warrant a “diagnosis of non-exclusive paedophilic disorder”, as outlined by the American Psychiatric Association. This is obviously taken from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V).
	
	
	He claimed to the psychologist some remorse for his actions and claimed to understand the severity of his situation. He claimed that he required treatment from psychiatrists to help ensure that he will not re-offend. It was noted that reoccurring behaviours of paedophilia will decrease with age, one would expect, with the lowering of sexual urges and the like.
	
	
	The psychologist asserted that the prisoner should seek treatment from a psychiatrist, clearly that is so, and that he should undertake counselling and other therapies, which is self-evidently so. It will be a matter for the Parole Authority to supervise that for a period of time but clearly he will need close monitoring when he is released to the community to ensure that he continues counselling and receives such medication that might be available to blunt his sexual urges.
	
	
	He did participate, up until September 2016, in a Corrective Services Community Maintenance Program and he had been attending at that program on a fortnightly basis since 10 May 2016. During that time he possessed child abuse material.
	
	
	As I said, I have noted the medical condition of his mother but arrangements for her welfare are matters that had to be attended to before he came into custody and there are no exceptional circumstances relating to her situation, as much as one may have sympathy for the fact that she is now, as I would understand it, 87 years of age and is a person of not good health.
	
	
	I have also taken into account the prisoner’s letter of apology to the court. The prisoner’s apology and the other matters that he raises directly in his letter to the court have to be considered in the context of the attitude that he expressed to Community Corrections in November last year.
	
	
	The survey of the material available to me, however, does not end with the material that is pertinent to the offending and the circumstances of the prisoner. I will come back to the significance of the evidence in a moment, in the context of dealing with the submissions of the parties.
	
	
	One matter of significance and of complexity, it must be said, is assessing an appropriate sentence for the prisoner in relation to what I call “the historical sexual offences”. It is undisputed, as I understand the way the matter was conducted from the bar table according to the authorities of the Court of Criminal Appeal cited that it was proper for this Court to take into account, as best as can be concluded, the sentencing practices of the Court of Criminal Appeal and the relevant jurisdictions, particularly the District Court, concerning the character of the offending at the time that the offending with which I am concerned occurred. Particularly if the practice has moved adversely to the prisoner (R v NJR [2002] NSWCCA 129, particularly at [69], [71]-[105].)
	
	
	In respect of the offences of buggery and indecent assault pursuant to
	
	
	s 81, sentencing practices, primarily because of changes to the categories of offending and related increases in maximum penalties for particular acts that the prisoner admits to committing in the period pleaded, have moved “adversely to the offender”. Many of the acts the prisoner admits to having committed against the victim, if committed in recent years, would potentially attract much greater penalties, although I have not been favoured with a precise analysis of the extent to which this is so. Many of the judgments brought to my attention, however, discuss this matter in greater detail than I need to now.
	
	
	To assist me in this difficult task, the learned Crown Prosecutor most helpfully provided a great many cases, providing a range of information. Many of the cases are decided, certainly as they are summarised, in the period of time between 1970 and the mid-1980’s as well as many decisions since 2000, some in the District Court and some in the Court of Criminal Appeal, where judges have sentenced for historical sexual offences that occurred at about the time that the offences with which I am now concerned. The Crown also provided most helpful statistical information in relation to such sentences. One of the judgments provided to me was in fact a judgment of my own.
	
	
	In respect of the offence of buggery, the range of penalty where terms of imprisonment were imposed, which almost always happened, was considerable, although the statistical information does not tell me if it includes sentences for offences that were then criminal but are no longer criminal. It should be pointed out, of course, there are some categories of “buggery” that involved sexual activity between consenting males. This is, of course, not such a case. The crime of “buggery” in the non-consensual sense, would cover a multitude of “sins”. Offences committed when offenders were sexually assaulting, in this particular manner, small children, teenagers or adults.
	
	
	The heavier sentences, one would have thought, reflected the comparative youth of the victim apropos that of the perpetrator, in circumstances of forced sexual intercourse, where, if it occurred with a female, would have been described then as “rape”. Of course, in relation to intercourse between males, full sexual intercourse could not be charged as ‘rape’ by definition, but many incidents of “buggery” involve anal sexual intercourse without consent.
	
	
	It is clear that the circumstances of this matter show sexual intercourse with the victim, in using modern terminology, or attempted sexual intercourse with the victim, where there could not be said to be any informed consent on the part of the victim. The victim was first of all sexually assaulted in this manner, when taken to the premises at Kogarah/Rockdale, in circumstances where he had no reason to expect what happened to him and, of course, on each occasion, suffered considerable pain. It is clear that even if he realised what was about to happen to him there was no suggestion of any informed or any other form of consent on his part. Clearly, on the facts, the prisoner, on each occasion, forced himself upon the victim on any objective view.
	
	
	In relation to indecent assault matters, the range of activities contemplated by s 81 was, by definition, relatively wide. The range of sentences where terms of imprisonment were imposed in the cases I examined is explained largely by the character of the maximum penalty. The greater maximum penalty for buggery to that of indecent assault has provided the opportunity for a greater range of sentences to be imposed.
	
	
	Of the material I have read some material was far more pertinent to the exercise of the task that I have undertaken. The material providing the greatest assistance, of course, is that concerned with the sentencing of offenders for offences committed over the same general time period, that is the late ‘70’s and the early 1980’s.
	
	
	The material that I have had regard to includes:
	
	
	1. Statistics for sentences for s.79 buggery matters in the period of time between April 2009-2016. Bearing in mind, of course, the offence of buggery was abolished by the legislature to be replaced by other offending in the late 1980’s. These statistics are taken from the Judicial Commission database.
	
	
	2. The table of cases that are set out in the judgment of Judge Finnane in McIntosh [2011] NSWDC 160 and in the review of that decision by the Court of Criminal Appeal, [2015] NSWCCA 184. The schedule in the latter decision for indicative sentences in respect of McIntosh committed between 1977 and 1983, in the re-sentencing exercise by the Court of Criminal Appeal is of some assistance. I appreciate Mr McIntosh was sentenced for a great many more offences than this prisoner and, of course, he had committed other offences after 1983 for which he was to be sentenced. Before I leave McIntosh, Judge Finnane QC provided in his judgment a schedule setting out cases to which he had regard and many of them are worth noting because of some similarities, both as to the character of the offending and the period of time over which it occurred.
	
	
	3. Court of Criminal Appeal decisions of Roberts [2003] NSWCCA 309; Barry [2001] NSWCCA 304; unreported decision of Barrett from the Court of Criminal Appeal of 3 March 1997, it does not have a neutral citation; the decision of Throw from the Court of Criminal Appeal of 26 April 1985 and Hill of 11 July 1999. Each of those decisions involving some analysis of historical sentencing practices has provided some assistance.
	
	
	4. The Public Defender’s Sentencing Table in respect of ‘buggery’ and ‘indecent assault’ offences between 1970 and 1980, with sentences imposed both at first instance and on appeal, both contemporaneous with the offending and at later time.
	
	
	5. Judicial Commission data from the District and Supreme Court in respect of decisions for sentencing in relation to buggery in the period of time between 2009 and 2015, of which there were 25 cases, I assume all applying the principles laid out in MJR and a similar collection of data in respect of indecent assault offences contrary to s 81 over the same period, of which there were 10 cases.
	
	
	6. The decision of PWB [2011] NSWCCA, particularly the judgment of
	
	
	R S Hulme J at [22]-[93] and the schedule or the table prepared by his Honour which discusses the increases in maximum penalties in respect of offending over the period of time that the offender was committing criminal offences. In respect of the offences for consideration by comparison, many of the offences identified in the schedule, of course, date from the mid-80’s through to the 1990’s, but there were three or four offences committed in the early 1980’s covered in the table prepared by his Honour from previous cases.
	
	
	7. R v Cable [2015] NSWDC 93. This is, of course, a case involving a Marist brother who had 19 victims, with offences committed over two decades and in total dozens and dozens of offences either dealt with on indictment, by committal for sentence and/or on a Form 1. It included, in relation to the matters for which he pleaded not guilty, offences of buggery in respect of four counts I have had regard to the indicative sentences fixed by his Honour at first instance.
	
	
	8. Another District Court decision to which I was referred was R v Denham [2015] NSWDC 21, which included two counts of buggery and 18 counts of indecent assault, with 23 matters on a Form 1. This was a case again involving a person in ‘holy orders’ as a priest, with offences committed largely between 1975 and 1979.
	
	
	9. There is also the decision of Anning [2014] NSWDC 359, a decision of my own and a relatively recent decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal of R v Brown [2012] NSWCCA 199 concerning an Anglican priest or minister, with 27 counts for sentence and 20 matters on a Form 1, including two counts of buggery, many acts of indecency and indecent assault on males aged between 10 and 18, committed between 1974 and 1996, with 20 victims. The facts are extensively set out, I hasten to say, at [16] in that judgment. Grove J, in his usual erudite way as he regularly pronounced judgment in the Court of Criminal Appeal and the Supreme Court, went through the facts in considerable detail. But in that matter, although it was an aggregate sentence which was overturned and increased, there was no table provided by his Honour as to the indicative sentences.
	
	
	10. Other District Court judgments again dealing with offences committed in the late ‘70’s, early 80’s, including R v Fox [2011] NSWDC 250 and Jacobs [2011] NSWDC 34.
	
	
	Of course, in considering indicative sentences or sentences imposed, either more recently or contemporaneous with the offending, there are a raft of differences between the relevant offenders to which I have referred as well as other offenders in other judgments that I need not cite. Differences between this offender and those offenders in terms of age, in terms of responsibility for the victims, in terms of the number of victims, the character of the acts, the number of acts and the multitude of matters that are required to be taken out in accordance with ‘Markarian’ principles.
	
	
	The purpose of looking at these sentences gives the court some idea of a range of sentence that was current at the relevant time, but one must be careful to ensure that, in understanding other sentences passed, there were many other considerations beyond simply the objective facts.
	
	
	It should be said about the offending with which I am concerned in relation to this prisoner, by reference to the “comparative” cases, as they may be described or the indicative range of sentences set out in judgments, that this prisoner was relatively young at the time of the offending. He was born in 1956 and, thus, he would have been 24 years or 25 years of age at relevant times and I have already noted the fact that he, at that point, had no prior convictions for indecently dealing with children.
	
	
	The prisoner’s mother’s reference, I should point out, I have read. It is clear that in her difficult circumstances she still thinks of her son fondly and she desires that when he is released from custody that he should live with her and that she will support him on his release from custody. Whether she is alive when he is released from custody is another matter.
	
	
	Counsel for the prisoner provided written submissions, dealing with the maximum penalties and the range of offending and I have already made some comments about aspects of his criminal history and his age and the like and the circumstances of the relationship with the prisoner with the victim reflecting upon the matters raised with me by the parties in submissions.
	
	
	With regard to the concession made on behalf of the prisoner, it is acknowledged that his conduct was wrong, which goes without saying, in so far as it relates to the treatment of the young victim many years ago and it is acknowledged, at least on behalf of the prisoner, although he does state so as well in his apology to the court, that there has been hurt and harm caused to the victim.
	
	
	The matter that concerns me was the matter that is identified as “attribution” in the written submissions. This was the subject of specific submissions by Mr Santisi who skilfully represents his client’s interests. This relates to the assertion that the prisoner “attributes his conduct to his diagnosed illness” and that “he too was a victim and that these sexual urges ... are more controlled with medication and medical intervention”.
	
	
	In relation to that aspect of the matter, it brings into sharper focus the consideration of the principles that were summarised by the Chief Judge at Common Law, Justice McClellan in the decision of De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194, particularly at [177]-[178].
	
	
	In that judgment, the learned Judge, in dealing with one aspect of that appeal, it was a complex appeal that raised many important issues in sentencing Commonwealth offenders, summarised the relevant principles at that time, to be applied in respect of the sentencing of an offender who has a proven mental illness or mental abnormality causally connected to the offending.
	
	
	I pause for a moment to acknowledge that, accepting for the moment the “diagnosis” of a “psychologist” that the prisoner has a “paedophilic disorder”, I accept that that disorder has a “causal” connection with the offending. But the critical issue is whether a paedophilic disorder is relevantly a mental disorder or a mental illness. Although nobody has ever described it in evidence to me as a “mental illness”. Is it to be contemplated to be addressed as one that would warrant the diminution of the weight to be given to general deterrence in the sentencing of offenders for child sexual abuse offences of the type with which I am now concerned?
	
	
	In this particular matter, the first point to be made is, firstly, that this attitude expressed on the prisoner’s behalf that he is a “victim” too reflects obfuscation and denial for responsibility which is reflected in the report prepared by Community Corrections. That he acts upon urges over which he has no control is one thing, but to describe oneself as a “victim” because of this, in circumstances where the urges lead to the destruction of other peoples’ lives or the damaging of other people or the abuse of other people, is to, in my view, avoid responsibility for one’s actions.
	
	
	The matters about which McClellan CJ at CL was principally talking, of course, were mental disorders or mental illnesses that contribute to the offending of a particular offender largely in circumstances where the offending is not necessarily the inevitable consequence of the mental illness or mental disorder.
	
	
	For example, an offender with an intellectual disability is not naturally driven to commit crimes. A person suffering from a mental illness such as bipolar disorder of “schizophrenia” is not necessarily going to commit crimes because of that particular disorder.
	
	
	Of course, I can see the logic of a “diagnosis” of a particular disorder, such as a paedophilic disorder, contributing to the offending behaviour. But it seems to me, without any empirical evidence to support the proposition, that largely speaking people with paedophilic disorders are going to act upon that disorder and are highly likely to commit crimes directly related to the disorder because of the character of the disorder. It is a disorder that causes adults to have sexual interests in children which are prohibited by the law. Most of the mental disorders and mental illnesses contemplated by McClellan J could not be so categorised.
	
	
	It is a moot point. I am not in a position to resolve it. One would need a great deal more empirical data and evidence in order as well as focused submissions to come to a concluded view. However, it should be fairly said that even if there was some weight to be given to the argument skilfully put by counsel for the prisoner in this narrow regard, noting the particular matters identified by the learned Chief Judge at Common Law from a range or authorities, it is also the case that in circumstances where a proven mental illness or mental disorder is causally linked to offending and does warrant the diminution of weight to be given to general deterrence, where the disorder makes the person a danger to the community or a danger to other individuals, there may be a need for greater weight than otherwise required to be given to personal deterrence. If it could be said that some diminution may be attributed to the weight to be given to general deterrence but certainly not swept away, on any view of the argument that was put or on any rational analysis, it would appear to me that such diminution as would be given would be counterbalanced by equally or, at least, greater weight being given to personal deterrence in the circumstances of this case.
	
	
	This offender, since he committed these crime, has committed crimes, as I understand it, against three separate victims over a number of years. He has, on two separate occasions, possessed child abuse material. I have seen some of the child abuse material he possessed in 2016. I have already categorised it as disturbing, disgusting and reflecting a, very unhealthy interest in sexual contact between adults and children or a very unhealthy interest in sexual conduct between children. Of course, the child abuse material reflects sexual conduct between children that is not mutual or spontaneous, but clearly coerced. No one could, ever argue that 12 and 13 or 14 year old foreign boys (if that is what they are), committing various sexual acts upon one another before a camera, are doing so because they like to do it or want to do it.
	
	
	As I said, the true picture behind or the true story behind those images cannot be known to us. But we can draw our own conclusions pretty readily from that.
	
	
	It is true, in the context of the matter I am discussing, just assuming for the moment that the prisoner has a paedophilic disorder, that the prisoner has sought some counselling in relation to the matter. He attended upon a psychiatrist over a period of time, not abundantly clear in the material available to me, and he has been prescribed some medication. But whatever he has done in this regard has not stopped him, since the last time he sexually assaulted children, on two separate occasions possessing and disseminating child abuse material. This reflects, it seems to me, much the same urges and interests that would compel him to commit direct sexual assaults upon children. This is to be borne in mind.
	
	
	The fact that he should commit the offence of possess child abuse material at the very time that he was appearing before me, at the very time that I was indulging his wish to look after his mother, reflects very adversely upon him in terms of any favourable consideration being given to his prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	Of course, the matters of which I speak, in the context of the submissions that were made by Mr Santisi, are very much rolled up in the consideration that I must have under s 3A of the Act of the purposes of sentencing. Whatever can be said about the relationship of his “condition” and the circumstances of the offending with which I am concerned, both the historical offending and the more recent offending, I am to ensure that he is adequately punished. I am required to prevent him committing further offences and endeavour to deter other persons from committing similar offences.
	
	
	The point about less weight being given to general deterrence in the case of a mental disorder is that it is a matter of considering whether the particular person with the particular mental disorder is an “appropriate vehicle” for the message of general deterrence, to paraphrase words falling from more learned lips from mine.
	
	
	The courts must ensure that those with the condition that the prisoner has do not succumb to their urges the way this prisoner has and thus the salience of the disorder, so far as considering the matter of diminution of general deterrence, is nowhere near as great as it might be in considering the sentencing of a person with an intellectual disability. Certainly, the sentencing of a person with a significant intellectual disability is a very different exercise indeed in terms of consideration of the extent to which any sentence imposed upon that offender may deter others from committing similar offences.
	
	
	Be that as it may, I am required to protect the community from the offender. I am required to promote his rehabilitation and I propose to do that in the way I structure the non-parole period. I have to make him accountable for his actions. I feel that the prisoner has not taken full account of his actions. I see little in the way of apology for his possession of the child abuse material in the letter that he wrote to me or anything in the nature of a genuine apology to the victim. I am required to denounce his conduct and particularly recognise the harm done to the victim of the historical offences, as well as the harm done to the community, in my view, by his involvement in the uploading and dissemination of child abuse material. Those various purposes of sentencing in their various ways all have a part to play in both categories of offending.
	
	
	With regard to the pleas of guilty, I am mindful of the history of the matter, which is referred to again in some detail in the written submissions of counsel for the accused. I have listened carefully to the submissions put by both parties. I accept that the plea of guilty in relation to the matters on indictment was late; in fact after the matter had been listed to start a trial. I am mindful of the fact that what is before me in that regard involves a considerable amount of plea negotiation, as it is described, with which I had no involvement.
	
	
	But I do acknowledge the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty, even as late as it is. A utilitarian value, I hasten to say, that soon will not be capable of being recognised with legislation proposed by the government. He has spared the victim the burden of having to give evidence and that is a matter to be recognised I propose, in all the circumstances, in accordance with the guideline judgment of Thomson and Houlton to give him the benefit of a
	
	
	15 per cent discount upon the otherwise appropriate sentence for the offences on indictment, taking into account the matters on the Form 1.
	
	
	In respect of the possess child abuse material, this issue is more straight forward. He pleaded guilty at the Local Court and was committed for sentence. I propose to give him a discount of 25 per cent upon the otherwise appropriate sentence for that offence, taking into account the matters on the
	
	
	Form 1, given the timeliness of the plea and the fact that he was committed for sentence.
	
	
	With regard to other matters that have been raised in the written and oral submissions put on behalf of the prisoner, so far as his antecedents at the time of the historical offending I have already noted that. However, in relation to the more recent offending for sentence, there are different considerations. In my view, the fact that he had previously been convicted of possessing child abuse material, that he had previously been convicted of sexual assaults against children, leads me to a conclusion that the record of previous convictions of itself represents an aggravating factor pursuant to s 21A(2) of the Act in respect of the 2016 offence for sentence.
	
	
	It is an aggravating factor, even with offenders with lengthy histories, that I am reluctant to identify. Although in many of those instances one would readily conclude that the person’s record does not entitle them to any particular leniency. But here, in the circumstances of his prior criminal history, the facts are that his previous record of possession of child abuse material and sexual assault offences is an aggravating factor.
	
	
	However, the most serious aggravating factor, as I have already pointed out, is the fact that that offence and the matters on the Form 1, closely related, I hasten to say, were committed whilst the offender was subject to conditional liberty. I have already commented upon that in two separate ways and that is a very significant aggravating factor indeed.
	
	
	I must say, in relation to the child abuse material, I am fully aware, from many cases that I have done, of people being in possession of far greater quantities of such material. Hundreds or thousands of still images, hundreds or even thousands of videos of various types, a cross-section of which I have sometimes been required to watch.
	
	
	If one were looking at the possession of child abuse material charge just by reference to the quantity of videos that were in his possession, one could say that the offending compared to other offences the court sees of this type reflect a quantity of material that has been seen to be dwarfed by other cases. But the quantity of the material is only one factor to be taken into account. The quality of the material is another matter to be taken into account. The images that I saw, if a cross-representation, are grossly offensive images, particularly in the context of the prisoner having this paedophilic disorder that the psychologist opines upon with a prior history of actually sexually abusing young children.
	
	
	Many offenders who come for sentence in relation to similar charges can claim, properly so, on the evidence available to the court, that they have not acted upon the urges that may cause them to view such material. Whilst this prisoner has not acted upon those urges to assault children since 2001 or perhaps a little earlier, the prisoner cannot claim historically that he has not ever acted upon such urges that would lead him to possess such material.
	
	
	In any event, it was a clearly contemptuous, if I could use that expression loosely, act of defiance of the responsibilities he had by being granted bail whilst he appeared before me that he committed that offence or continued to commit that offence. I appreciate that offence began before he actually pleaded guilty.
	
	
	That is no consolation for him, because pleading guilty recognises the fact that he must have known throughout that period of time that he committed the 2016 offence that he was, in fact, guilty of the historical crimes alleged against him.
	
	
	A mitigating factor that is relevant to the objective facts of the 2016 offence and the historical sex offences, applying current, law is that the offences were not part of a planned or organised criminal activity. I pause for a moment to just point out, in respect of the possess child abuse material, the uploading and downloading of such material is, I would expect, a relatively simple matter for anybody with any basic computer skills.
	
	
	I appreciate, of course, that the organisation of young children to perform these disgusting acts in the presence of adults or against one another is conduct that can be the product of, no doubt, criminal organisations who are producing such material for profit or for self-satisfaction or self “enjoyment”. But there is no evidence before me that the prisoner is part of such an organisation although he is a beneficiary of it.
	
	
	With regard to the first series of offending, dealing with some ‘mitigating’ factors pursuant to s.21A(2) of the Act if I may, the prisoner, at that time, did not have, in my view, a significant record of previous convictions, but I could not conclude that he was a person of good character then.
	
	
	Certainly, it must be said that he is now not a person of good character when he comes for sentence now in relation to all offences. I cannot conclude now that he is unlikely to re-offend and, contrary to the urges of his counsel in the written submissions and the oral submissions, I cannot conclude that he has good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	As I say on occasions in sentencing, as I was moved to say this morning in another matter, often the ‘proof is in the pudding’ and, despite the counselling he received and the medication he has received in the past, he was still able to commit offences in 2016 whilst on bail for matters awaiting trial.
	
	
	I could not conclude in relation to any of the offences with which I am concerned the prisoner has relevant “remorse”. I have noted his apology, his expressions of shame and the like, but I have also noted what he said to the Community Corrections officer, failing to take responsibility for his conduct.
	
	
	His counsel suggested that his client was not a “completely hopeless case” and he was a person who could not be regarded as “not capable of rehabilitation”. Well, that may be true but he is a man who will need close monitoring by the authorities for many years to come.
	
	
	There was a submission made on his behalf that I should make a finding of ‘special circumstances’ pursuant to s 44 of the Act. I propose to do that. In part, because of the character and timing of the sentences I impose there will be some degree of partial accumulation to reflect the totality of his criminality and because he will need an extensive period of supervision to adjust to community living and to be directed as to means to avoid further offending. This is a step to be taken, not just for his protection, but for the protection of the community in my view.
	
	
	Many of the matters raised by the learned Crown Prosecutor in his helpful written submissions I have already dealt with before. Matters relating to characterisation of the offending, the reflection upon the significance of committing offences whilst subject to conditional liberty, the discounts to be applied for the offending.
	
	
	The Crown very properly put that the offending in 2016 could not be regarded as “a sudden aberration”. The Crown put in specific terms that the mental condition identified by the psychologist was “not a disorder”, that relevantly affected the weight to be given to general deterrence and ultimately, as I have said, if it had any effect upon general deterrence favourable to the prisoner, that advantage is outweighed by the considerable weight to be given to personal deterrence. He cited Engert as one such case, a decision of Gleeson CJ from 1995, dealing with that particular matter and acknowledged in the findings of McClellan CJ at CL.
	
	
	So far as the purposes of sentencing are concerned, of course, as was held in Veen (No 2), they can sometimes point in opposing directions, but here they generally, it must be fairly said, point in one direction.
	
	
	Taking into account the matters on the Form 1, in respect of the indictable matter and the matters on the Form 1 in respect to the committal for sentence matter, I have had regard to Attorney-General’s Application (No 1) of 2002, (2002) 56 NSWLR 147. In taking into account matters on the Form 1, the Court of Criminal Appeal held in that particular guideline judgment and it has been held subsequently in other judgments of the Court of Criminal Appeal, that usually greater weight should be given to the need for personal deterrence and the community is entitled to extract retribution. The “entire point of the process” is to impose a longer sentence or to alter the nature of the sentence that would have been imposed if the principal offence sentence stood alone.
	
	
	It was wrong to suggest that the additional penalty should be small, sometimes it will be substantial. However, the court noted that the sentencing process is only concerned with the principal offence, not to determine appropriate sentence for matters listed on a Form 1 or to determine an overall sentence that would be appropriate or all the offences and apply a discount, giving appropriate weight to the matters to be taken into account.
	
	
	In increasing the sentence for the primary offence, the court observed that there were matters that limited the extent that this will be so and it was rarely appropriate, the court said, for the sentencing judge to “attempt to quantify the effect on the sentence for taking into account Form 1 offences”. (See generally [18]-[44].)
	
	
	I note that their Honours observed that the offences included on a Form 1 will have a significant lower salience in the sentencing processes for various reasons, however, a judge must be careful to assess whether it is appropriate to proceed to sentence on that basis, as there may be cases where the administration of justice would be properly brought into disrepute by the court proceeding to sentence a person guilty of a course of criminal conduct on a “manifestly inadequate, unduly narrow or artificial basis”.
	
	
	In this regard, I simply say that the matters on the Form 1 in relation to the buggery offence are much more significant in the sentencing process, by reason of greater weight being given to personal deterrence and denunciation, than the offences on the Form 1 relating to the possess child abuse material. Those latter matters are intimately bound up with the principal offending. But it is to be borne in mind that the Form 1 matters in relation to the buggery matter are concerned with quite separate offending and, in fact, in some instances, offending of equal seriousness to the principal offence.
	
	
	The other matter to be acknowledged, of course, is recognition of the need for totality of sentencing in the sentences that must be imposed for substantive offending requiring discreet penalties to be imposed. I note the decision of the High Court of Australia in Mill v R (1988) 166 CLR 59, particularly at [62]-[63], but also the judgment of the majority in Pearce v R (1998) 194 CLR 610, particularly at [45].
	
	
	As their Honours noted, in order to have transparency in sentencing, it is appropriate for the court to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then, having done that, turn its mind to issues that are concerned with accumulation or concurrence, to reflect the issue of totality, notwithstanding, as their Honours pointed out, that the primary question asked by the prisoner him or herself will be “how long” is the sentence. These matters are reflected in the structure of the sentences.
	
	
	I should note, of course, the plea of guilty in each instance is a “mitigating factor”. But of course the prisoner receives a discreet discount in respect of the pleas that have been entered by him.
	
	
	In relation to the historical offences, I have not identified any particular “aggravating factor” pursuant to s 21A(2). Of course, I appreciate from the material available to me, allowing for what the Act and what the Court of Criminal Appeal has said about the receipt of victim impact statements, they remain untested and the like, but the harm to the victim obviously must be regarded as substantial. But I am not proposing to find that as an “aggravating factor” under the terms of s 21A(2). In my view, the harm to the victim is adequately catered for in consideration of the matters that arise under s 21A(1) as accepted as an inevitable consequence of conduct of this type.
	
	
	Could you stand up, please, Mr Collins?
	
	
	In relation to the matter for which you were committed for sentence, that is the possess child abuse material matter, you are convicted. I have accorded you a 25 per cent discount on a sentence of five years imprisonment, noting the 10 year maximum penalty. The sentence I have fixed has regarded those aggravating factors that I have identified, which are of considerable significance.
	
	
	You are sentenced to three years, nine months imprisonment to date from 14 October 2016 and to expire, on my calculation, on 13 July 2020. For reasons associated with the other sentences I have to impose, I decline to fix a non-parole period in respect of that sentence.
	
	
	In relation to count 1 on the indictment, that is the offence of indecent assault, bearing in mind the 15 per cent discount and it is the first offence in time committed against the victim, you are convicted. You are sentenced to one year and three months imprisonment commencing from 14 December 2018, expiring on 13 March 2020. Again, I decline to fix a non-parole period because of the sentences imposed in relation to count 1.
	
	
	In respect of count 2, taking into account matters on the Form 1, you are sentenced to a term of two years, nine months imprisonment by way of non‑parole period to date from 14 June 2019, expiring on 3 March 2022. That is the date you will be eligible for release to parole.
	
	
	The balance of sentence in relation to that term of imprisonment is two years and nine months and that term of imprisonment expires on 13 December 2024. You can take a seat.
	
	
	I was incorrect in the earlier statement I made. The total sentence imposed upon you is eight years and two months and the effective
	
	
	non-parole period is five years and three months.
	
	
	METCALFE: Sorry, your Honour, I’ve made - I didn’t get a full note. For the indecent assault that’s on the indictment, one year and three months commencing on what was the date?
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: 14 December 2018, expiring on 13 March 2020. So it is two years and two months into the sentence for possess child abuse material.
	
	
	METCALFE: And the last one I didn’t get, I do apologise.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: The balance of the sentence in relation to the last matter is two years and nine months.
	
	
	METCALFE: And that expires, that’s the date.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: That is a total sentence, in effect, of five years, six months and that expires on 13 December 2024, starting on 14 June 2019. I initially said “eight years” to the prisoner but it is eight years and two months.
	
	
	Any other matter, Mr Crown?
	
	
	METCALFE: Two years and nine months non-parole for the count 2?
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: That is exactly right, with a balance of sentence of two years and nine months. That is a finding of special circumstances, both by reason of the partial accumulation of one sentence, or two sentences, one upon the other. That sentence is accumulative on the indecent assault matter to the extent of six months.
	
	
	METCALFE: So effectively the first time that he may well be eligible for parole would be some time in 2022?
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: 13 March 2022, yes. Do you understand the sentences,
	
	
	Mr Collins? Non-parole period of five years, five months, dating from the date you came into custody, a total sentence of eight years and two months.

6224174,"R v ALLOUCHE, Bilal; R v EL CHAMI, Mohammed [2017] NSWDC 283","SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Today I am sentencing two gentlemen, Mohammed El Chami and Bilal Allouche, each to what could be called a “common offence” but relating to different circumstances. Each of the offenders is to be sentenced in relation to an offence contrary to s 7(1) of the Firearms Act 1996. In the case of Mr Allouche, in respect of an offence that he, on 21 October 2015, at Punchbowl in the State of New South Wales, did possess a pistol, namely a Belgian brand .380 calibre silver revolver, not being authorised to do so by licence or permit. In respect of that offence, there is a related offence on a s 166 certificate of possessing ammunition for a firearm without being authorised to possess that ammunition by licence or permit. The firearms offence has a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment and it has a standard non-parole period of four years imprisonment. The standard non-parole period for this particular offence was raised from three years to four years, on my researches, in approximately August 2015.
	
	
	In respect of Mr El Chami, his offence is one of on the same date but at a different location, possessing a pistol, namely a black coloured pistol with removable magazine (no brand), not being authorised to do so by a licence or permit. This offence obviously carries the same maximum penalty as the one to which the prisoner Mr Allouche pleaded guilty. The related offence relating to this gentleman is likewise an offence of possessing ammunition for a firearm without being authorised to possess that ammunition by a licence or permit.
	
	
	In respect of the offence on the s 166 certificate for each of the offenders, this is an offence contrary to s 65(3) of the Firearms Act 1996 and carries a maximum penalty of 50 penalty units. For reasons I will explain in due course, I propose, in the case of Mr El Chami, to order that he be fined the modest sum of $100 in respect of that offence. Being a matter on a certificate it requires a discreet penalty. In the case of Mr Allouche, I propose to convict him pursuant to s 10A but impose no further penalty.
	
	
	The reason for that will be self-evident from the facts. The circumstances of the prisoners’ possession of the ammunition and, of course, the significance of the presence of the ammunition in the firearm is so intimately bound up in the principal offence and so salient to the sentencing exercise in relation to that offence, that in my view it is not appropriate to impose any further penalty in relation to that. If I did, in any event, it would be obviously of the character of a fine.
	
	
	The reason the two men are before me today and came before me last week is to be found in the fact that each of them, in 2015, were charged in relation to a murder allegation which led to their respective arrests in October 2015. Each of the offences for sentence today, the principal offences and the matters on the certificate, arose from police operations conducting searches of the residences of the respective offenders in connection with the particular matter for which they were, at one point, each charged with murder. I do not propose to go through the details of the circumstances relating to the alleged murder with which they are originally charged. Those matters are set out in the judgment of her Honour Justice Fullerton, delivered on 21 July 2017, in R v Rajab & Ors (the others including the two prisoners before me today) [2017] NSWSC 975.
	
	
	For reasons which will be self-evident from later remarks I make, many of her Honour’s findings in relation to that sentencing exercise have salience in this sentencing exercise. Two of the offenders that were sentenced by her Honour are the two gentlemen before me today and, of course, the sentencing of these two gentlemen occurred only four weeks ago and much of the material, from what I can gather from reading her remarks on sentence, that was available to her Honour was presented to me in this sentencing exercise, albeit in a different context.
	
	
	I should point out that whilst the two prisoners were charged in relation to the murder to which I referred, ultimately, as the matter unfolded and was concluded, neither prisoner was sentenced in respect of matters relating to responsibility for the death of the deceased. In fact, Mr Allouche was convicted of being an accessory after the fact to murder and was sentenced in the context of the facts as her Honour found it in relation to that matter to what might be seen as a “modest” sentence of six months imprisonment.
	
	
	In relation to Mr El Chami, he was convicted of concealing a “serious offence”. The concealment that he was concerned with was limited to the fact that he failed to disclose to police over a period of time that he had been present in the park where the deceased person was shot at Punchbowl on 29 June 2015. He, Mr El Chami, was sentenced to three months imprisonment in relation to that offence, which reflected most of the time that he had spent in custody after he had been charged by police in late October 2015. He ultimately had been released to bail earlier in 2016 and it would appear, based upon the calculations of the Crown and myself, that Mr El Chami has two days credit for time spent in custody not referrable to the sentence imposed by her Honour.
	
	
	It is also clear from her Honour’s reasoning that Mr Allouche’s role as an accessory after the fact was a limited one. The sentence imposed by her Honour reflected an aspect of the matter that is of significance in the formulation of the sentence I impose. That is that Mr Allouche was initially taken into custody in late October 2015, charged with murder and effectively remained bail refused up until the time that he appeared before her Honour to be sentenced for being an accessory after the fact.
	
	
	The Crown has undertaken a number of calculations in relation to the matter and has identified 280 days of pre-sentence custody related this matter, not referrable to any sentences imposed either by her Honour in respect of the accessory after the fact matter or in the Local Court in respect of a matter of driving whilst disqualified. My understanding is that the effective sentences imposed at the Local Court and by her Honour total 11 months imprisonment, to be subtracted from the time that Mr Allouche was in custody, that is from 24 October 2015 until 21 July 2016.
	
	
	I have calculated, taking into account 280 days of custody, backdated from 18 August takes the sentence I impose to a date in early-mid November. But I have determined, as I foreshadowed to Mr Allouche, to backdate his sentence to 18 August. Well might someone ask, “What was that decided upon?” The reason was that I, as was submitted by learned Senior Counsel for the prisoner, I was required to give full effect to consideration of the concept of totality of sentencing.
	
	
	I am very mindful, of course, that her Honour chose to make the six months sentence she imposed accumulative upon a quite distinct and separate offending of driving whilst disqualified. But, in my view, giving full effect to the concept of totality in sentencing, I could not make any sentence I impose entirely “accumulative” upon that time spent in custody that could be said to be referrable to other offending.
	
	
	Part of the reason for that was by regard to what the concept of totality represents. There are a number of decisions relating to this, perhaps the leading authority is, of course, the 1998 decision of Mill v R, which is reported at 166 CLR 55, but also there is the obiter dicta that appears in the decision of McHugh J, that learned senior counsel for the prisoner referred me to, in the High Court judgment of Postiglione (1997) 189 CLR 295.
	
	
	In the matter of Postiglione the principal issue that was resolved by the Court in the leading judgment, as I would understand it given by Dawson and Gaurdon JJ, was directed at the issue of ‘parity’ of sentencing. But McHugh J, in his usual erudite way, noted in the context of the matters requiring consideration in Mr Postiglione’s case that regard to totality of sentencing required an evaluation of the overall criminality involved in all offences for which a prisoner is charged. His Honour went on to say,
	


“Recent decisions in the Court of Criminal Appeal have extended the ambit of the totality principle. Those decisions hold that in order to comply with the totality principle, a sentencing judge must consider the total criminality involved, not only in the offences for which the offender is being sentenced, but also in any offences for which the offender is currently serving a sentence.”


	
	His Honour, in that regard, cited part of the judgment of Hunt J of the New South Wales Supreme Court in an earlier decision of Gordon. Justice Hunt, who was then the Chief Judge at Common Law, observed,
	


“When a custodial sentence is to be imposed, which will be cumulative upon or which will overlap an existing custodial sentence, the judge must take into account that existing sentence, so the total period to be spent in custody adequately and fairly represents the totality of the criminality involved in all of the offences to which the total period is attributable.”


	
	This is nothing new, of course. Judges in this jurisdiction are required to have regard to this aspect of sentencing on many occasions, most notably in circumstances where the court is exercising its supervisory jurisdiction over the Local Court and reviewing sentences of imprisonment previously imposed, where the magistrate might not have turned his or her mind to the concept of totality. Or where the judge is imposing a term of imprisonment for indictable offences in circumstances where there were to be taken into account previous terms of imprisonment currently being served for matters dealt with in the Local Court.
	
	
	There are many other examples of that occurring. Thus, I have determined in the case of Mr Allouche, whilst it may have been open to me simply to backdate the sentence by the 280 days calculated by the Crown, to extend the benefit of that backdating to a period one year from today, thus effectively making the sentence I impose partially accumulative upon the effective sentences imposed at the Local Court to which I referred and by her Honour.
	
	
	Of course, it is obvious from what I have said that her Honour’s sentence, in its terms by reference to her judgment, was actually calculated to commence in late 2016 and expire in 2017 and the Magistrate’s order was made in 2016. But one must look at the matter from the perspective of the total time spent in custody, calculate the 11 months imposed in the other jurisdictions from the date the prisoner came actually into custody, which is in late October 2015 and then stand back and consider, as best one can do, the totality of the criminality.
	
	
	The offending in relation to Mr Allouche concerning a firearm is, at face value, separate from the offending for which he was found guilty of accessory after the fact to murder. But it has a relationship which is apparent in the material presented to me.
	
	
	To deal with the objective facts of the matters. Firstly in relation to Mr El Chami, police executed a search warrant at his home in Lakemba, where he lived with his wife, in a small flat at the rear of his parents’ property. Police located what is described as a 6 millimetre Airsoft calibre air pistol in a right bedside drawer. It was examined by a forensic ballistics expert and found to be an “airgun” and a “pistol”, as defined under s 4 of the Firearms Act. However, the firearm was not in working order. It had a faulty trigger mechanism and, as the Crown has helpfully identified in its written submissions for which I am very grateful, there was evidence available at the proceedings that occurred before the matter came before me that the object itself was made of plastic.
	
	
	The ammunition that was found, giving rise to the charge on the s 166 certificate was ammunition for a firearm other than that found. It was a .38 calibre round of ammunition but it was not capable of being discharged by the airgun. The prisoner, of course, was not the holder of a licence or permit that authorised him to possess either the ammunition or the “pistol”.
	
	
	I have concluded, in the context of the range of offences that might be contemplated under the section and the character of “firearms” or “pistols” that warrant prosecution under the section in the absence of any suggestion whatsoever that the prisoner was proposing to use the firearm to commit other crimes even as a weapon designed to cause someone fear, that this offence, in the scheme of things, is at the very lowest if not the lowest level of seriousness of offences of this type. The firearm itself was completely incapable of discharging any projectile in its condition.
	
	
	There is some material, I appreciate untested, in references written on behalf of the prisoner from family members that the firearm itself was an item that the prisoner had had since he was a child. Whether that be true or not, in the context of those representations not being able to be tested if needs be by the Crown I do not know. They may not be disputed, for all I know, if given on oath or affirmation. The weapon itself is one that could not harm anybody.
	
	
	In relation to Mr El Chami, at the time of the commission of the offence with which I am concerned he was then unconvicted, if I can use that expression, of the offence that he had committed before the time of his arrest. That is the offence of concealing a serious indictable offence. So, I sentence him on the basis that he had committed that offence, although he, at that time, remained unconvicted.
	
	
	The prisoner otherwise had no other convictions or findings of guilt in New South Wales. He had a finding of guilt at the Southport Magistrates Court in March 2013 for possessing dangerous drugs and possessing utensils or pipes that had been used and I note in relation to all the charges, the number of charges is not entirely clear. No conviction was recorded by the Magistrates Court and he was ordered to pay a $450 fine. One can assume, I think fairly safely, that his possession of any “dangerous drugs” was for his own use.
	
	
	Staying with Mr El Chami just for the moment, there was a body of material provided to the court in respect of him, relating to his circumstances, both references from family members, a reference from a metal fabrication company indicating that the prisoner was employed by that company. It would appear he has been known to the owner of the company for 12 years and, given the prisoner was born in 1990, and on my rough calculation would be 26 years of age, obviously the prisoner knows the owner of that company through a family or parental connection.
	
	
	There is a psychological report setting out some details of his background which I am prepared to accept for the purposes of sentencing. I must say, as I said earlier, her Honour Fullerton J, when sentencing the prisoner for the matter before her, made various findings of fact in relation to the prisoner which coincide with the findings that I make on the material available to me. As I said earlier, I am not completely sure of this, but it seems highly likely that much of the material before me was available to her Honour.
	
	
	In fact, the date of the report prepared by the psychologist available to me is 22 June 2007, before the evidence was given to her Honour for sentencing purposes. Her Honour notes the same psychologist that has prepared the report before me was the reporting psychologist to her Honour.
	
	
	The findings of fact are set out at [122], and may, for my purposes, reflect accurately the findings that I am prepared to make, although I have independently reviewed the material.
	
	
	I just make the further observation that I have read the psychological report and whilst there are some suggestions of reaction or consequence from his “forensic difficulties”, there are no mental illnesses or mental disabilities identified as being causally related to the offending with which I am concerned.
	
	
	Her conclusion was that whilst the offender, given his conduct as a teenager with suspensions and the like from school, may have met the requirements for the diagnosis of “Oppositional Defiance Disorder ODF”, there was no indication that he would have met the criteria for the diagnosis of Conduct Disorder. The psychologist felt it was significant that he had a close and supportive relationship with his family and his partner and no history of psychological or psychiatric problems and he was a low to moderate range at risk of re-offending.
	
	
	In that context, I have regard to the references that were provided on his behalf. I particularly note the reference of his wife. The prisoner has a one year old baby boy. His wife, at the time of writing her reference in August 2017, was four months pregnant with their second child. She spoke of his personality. She described him as generous, a person with a sense of humour and a caring personality. She, amongst other family members who provided references, said that she had seen the firearm in question “multiple times”. She had asked him why he kept it and he said that he had had it since he was a child and it reminded him of his childhood. She regards him as of great support to herself.
	
	
	The father of the prisoner also wrote a reference, speaking of the circumstances in which the family came from Lebanon, the great difficulties they had in that country that has suffered a great deal of torment from a range of outside forces for many years and how he came to Australia looking for peace and economic contentment. He spoke of the qualities of his son, which he said made the prisoner a person that he was proud of.
	
	
	The prisoner also wrote a letter to the court, offering his apologies, explaining his possession of the firearm, which I have already dealt with. He did not understand that it was illegal to own the firearm, although ignorance of the law is no excuse. He speaks of the salutary effect of being in custody in relation to the other matter, the circumstances of him being on bail have assisted him to reflect upon his criminality in relation to this matter and he speaks of his affection for his wife and his child and his wish to continue to support them. I have taken all of that evidence into account.
	
	
	With regard to Mr Allouche, likewise in his case there is a body of material, both references and a psychological report. Likewise, in relation to
	
	
	Mr Allouche, her Honour Fullerton J made various findings as to his subjective circumstances, particularly in relation to this accused at [95] - [100]. In respect of the psychological report, like her Honour, I cannot find any evidence of any matter that shows a causal connection between the offending and any condition the prisoner may be said to have and, in any event, there is nothing identified in the character of a psychological or psychiatric condition requiring treatment, although the psychologist recommends counselling on his release from custody, which I support.
	
	
	On the non-verbal intelligence test, quoting a number of tests being administered to the prisoner. The prisoner was described as being of “below average” intelligence. Some of the tests were not valid, for reasons I need not go into. Some of the testing led to results that were not particularly significant in this sentencing exercise. There was some levels of depression assessed but they may well have been reactive to the circumstances in which the prisoner was in at the time of the testing. There were no significant levels of anxiety.
	
	
	The prisoner, in the context of the facts alleged against him, which I will come to in a moment, reported significant fear following ongoing death threats from the family of the deceased man, for which the prisoner was not responsible for killing and expressed a willingness to undertake psychological programs on his release from custody.
	
	
	So far as the objective facts relating to Mr Allouche, he was detected in possession of the relevant firearm when a search warrant was executed at his home on 21 October 2015. The firearm was found in a bedroom that the prisoner shared with his brother. The prisoner was not arrested at that point and, in fact, was not arrested, as I understand the matter, until 23 October, at the Sydney International Airport. Whether he was endeavouring to leave the country or not is not made clear on the facts.
	
	
	When the police were searching the residence of the prisoner in connection with the murder investigation they found the firearm. It was a six chamber revolver, with a shoulder bag and it was secreted in a wardrobe in the bedroom of the offender. The revolver was loaded with six .38 calibre rounds of ammunition. When asked about the firearm, the prisoner denied knowledge of it or its presence in the bedroom to his knowledge and, when the firearm was examined further, a mixed DNA profile was identified on the grip of the firearm with the DNA profile of the offender being the major contributor.
	
	
	In respect of that particular offence, of course, it is clear that the firearm was an operating firearm, as distinct from the circumstances of Mr El Chami. It was a firearm that was loaded, which is a significant matter in assessing the seriousness of an offence of possessing a firearm.
	
	
	I bear in mind that the firearm was not being displayed in public. There was no suggestion that the prisoner has in any way, by body movement or verbal threat, suggested to police that he was intending to use it in their presence. I accept that the firearm was hidden in a bedroom of a house where the prisoner lived; it was not on “public display”, and was not “readily accessible” to the extent that it may have been hidden in the wardrobe. It certainly was not secure in a gun safe. Not that the prisoner had any right to have access to a gun safe, let alone the firearm that he had in his possession.
	
	
	The prisoner asserts, in hearsay representations which are not tested, that his possession of the firearm was related to his concern for his safety, given the circumstances of the killing of the gentleman at Punchbowl in late June. In relation to the claim of the prisoner that he was in fear of his safety, I am prepared to accept, having read the remarks on sentence of her Honour relating to the circumstances of the killing of the deceased and related matters, that the prisoner, in the context of being innocent of the responsibility of the death of that person, had some basis to be fearful for his safety. Particularly in the context of fearing attribution to him of responsibility for a crime that he did not commit.
	
	
	His presence at the park where the deceased was killed was not, it was found, by reason of the plea entered by the prisoner, concerned with any pre‑conceived plan for the deceased to be shot as he was by one of the co‑accused. That having been recognised, however, it is important to reflect upon some matters that were identified by the Crown in its very helpful written submissions.
	
	
	The Crown, in its written submissions, referred the Court to a range of authority, well recognised, and reflected, of course, in the Judicial Commission Sentencing Bench Book.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the “mere” possession of a firearm and the fact that there is a standard non-parole period highlights the view of the legislature, to be enforced by Judges, that there is an increasing threat to the community arising from the possession of firearms to which people are not entitled to gain access.
	
	
	In sentencing for firearms offences, there has to be an element, and a strong element, of general deterrence in respect of these offences.
	
	
	The legislative purpose is clear, and as was pointed out by the learned counsel for the Crown in the written submissions, as Rothman J observed in the decision of Laspina v Regina [2016] NSWCCA 181:
	


“[6] For far too long courts have dealt with firearm offences in a way which has had regard to whether the firearms were intended to be used in a criminal offence of another kind. In doing so, in my view, we are underplaying the seriousness of firearm offences generally, including mere possession.”


	
	So far as the prisoner’s reason proffered, albeit in a hearsay fashion untested, for his possession of the firearm, again, as the Crown has submitted, it has been recognised for a number of years that possession of a loaded firearm for one’s “own protection” is not a matter of significant, “if any”, mitigation. Latham J made this observation in the decision of Krstic [2005] NSWCCA 391, particularly at [14].
	
	
	She observed that the policy of the legislature evidenced by the creation of the offence and the maximum penalty is to “deter and punish possession of firearms per se”, whatever be the reason behind it.
	
	
	In any event, one must ask oneself, if one is in possession of a firearm for “self-defence”, what good is the firearm to that person without actually using it, particularly in circumstances where the firearm is loaded. Of course, it is well recognised in various authorities that are cited in the Bench Book that the possession of a firearm that is loaded at the time that it is detected is an aggravating factor.
	
	
	It was observed in the decision of Najem [2008] NSWCCA 32, at [40], that there is a recognition that firearms and pistols if possessed are liable to be used, and if used are liable to be a source of great danger or damage.
	
	
	It also involves a recognition “that not all persons can be relied on to avoid or minimise such danger and not misuse the weapons, and that misuse, even without discharge, is liable to amount to a great infringement of “[the rights of others].”
	
	
	However, it is recognised in the context of the range of seriousness of offences of this type that a person’s criminality is more serious when the person possesses a firearm as part of their involvement in other crimes, such as trading in illegal drugs or even trading in illegal firearms or involving oneself in “serious assaults”.
	
	
	I do not conclude that this prisoner possessed the firearm in furtherance of his “involvement in serious assaults” on the basis that he was not convicted of primary or secondary involvement in the killing of the man at Punchbowl.
	
	
	I bear in mind too that there are other aggravations that can arise in sentencing of this type, such as defacing the identity of the firearm, possession the firearm in a manner that would allow others readily to get access to the firearm, or displaying the firearm in public and the like.
	
	
	Having a firearm in one’s possession in order to enable others to make use of the firearm is another circumstance of general aggravation. I am not talking now about aggravations under s 21A(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I am talking about aggravations in the understanding of the general principles relating to fact finding that are incorporated within s 21A(1) of the Act.
	
	
	In relation to Mr Allouche, as I said in my introduction of the material relating to him, Mr Allouche has been sentenced by her Honour for offending that occurred, although he was unconvicted of it at the time, before his arrest in relation to the current matter. I also noted that the prisoner had been sentenced to a term of imprisonment in relation to driving whilst disqualified.
	
	
	To return to the detail of his criminal history, the context is that the prisoner was born on 17 May 1993, and thus is now 24. At the time of the commission of the offence with which I am concerned, he would have been 22 years of age.
	
	
	The prisoner has a number of findings of guilt in relation to the misuse of motor vehicles. In 2014 he was sentenced to seven months imprisonment, which was suspended, in relation to a drive whilst disqualified matter. He has convictions in 2009 for driving as a learner whilst unaccompanied; in 2010 for driving whilst suspended; for driving in a manner dangerous or recklessly in 2013; and for driving whilst disqualified, an offence committed in February 2014. That offence of driving whilst disqualified in 2014 was dealt with by a fine and a period of disqualification.
	
	
	The offence of driving whilst disqualified dealt with in the Local Court to which I earlier referred was an offence committed on 13 October 2015, that is, before the offence of possessing the firearm but before the prisoner’s arrest on 23 October of that year.
	
	
	The prisoner obviously was in custody awaiting determination of the more serious charge when he appeared at the Burwood Local Court on 21 July 2016 and was convicted and sentenced to five months imprisonment commencing on 21 July 2016, the date of the order. I have already earlier explained the way in which I approach the sentencing of the prisoner taking that matter and Fullerton J’s sentence into account.
	
	
	As her Honour pointed out in the circumstance of also having to sentence the prisoner’s brother at the same time for being an accessory after the fact to murder, the prisoner’s criminal history did not entitle him to any particular leniency, although it was not an aggravating factor in that sentencing exercise and is not an aggravating factor here.
	
	
	With regard to her findings of fact concerning his personal circumstances, they are in accord with my understanding of the material available. I have mentioned the psychological report already. I did receive what I thought was a very interesting letter prepared by Teresa Allouche, his sister-in-law, who has known the prisoner for 20 years. Her letter was an exceedingly learned and insightful document, a very sophisticated document indeed. Whether the detail of that document was before her Honour or not, I do not know. It reflects upon a particular finding of her Honour in relation to Mr Allouche’s family, not that they are on trial or for sentence, that the prisoner is not a person who comes from what could be described as a “dysfunctional family”. He has considerable family support, particularly from Ms Allouche, his sister-in-law, and his siblings, and she would continue to support him, as would other members of the family, as they have done throughout the time that he has been in detention. His parents are law‑abiding people. His presence in custody charged with an offence of murder has been a shocking experience for the family. Of course, probably aggravated by the fact that his brother was in a similar position.
	
	
	It is to be fairly said in relation to that reference and other references that they do not seem to appreciate the relevance of his prior offending, and they certainly do not reflect the detail of the, if I could call it, misbehaviour of the prisoner over the period of time that he was at school. Why he would misbehave in the way that he admitted whilst at Punchbowl Boys’ High School and the like is difficult to explain. He told the psychologist that he had over 50 school suspensions in both primary school and high school, and was expelled from school in year nine.
	
	
	He has had various employment since leaving school and has worked as a carpenter for a period of time. In that regard I note that he has a reference from an employer who employed him before he went into custody in 2015, and in the short period of time that he has been at large since being released from custody in July 2017. He has returned to that employment.
	
	
	His employer describes him as “hard-working”, with a commitment to the tasks at work, and his employer is prepared to continue to support him. I trust that support will continue after the sentence which I impose. He believed in recent times the prisoner had matured, and one would hope that that was true. Otherwise, as I have said, the matters that fell from her Honour’s lips concerning the circumstances of the prisoner are findings that accord with the evidence available to the Court in this matter.
	
	
	There are obviously, in the consideration of Mr Allouche’s matter, a number of important considerations. I have already dealt with the assessment of the objective seriousness of Mr El Chami’s offending.
	
	
	Mr Allouche’s offending, in my view, taking all relevant matters into account, and noting the absence of the aggravations which I have earlier identified, falls well within the middle range of objective seriousness of offending based only upon the objective circumstances.
	
	
	His counsel, in his helpful written submissions, sought to portray the offending as below the mid-range of objective seriousness, but one could not conclude that. The firearm, as I have earlier pointed out, was loaded, and that is a very significant matter. It was a firearm of considerable threat, certainly capable of inflicting lethal and fatal injury to another if discharged.
	
	
	If the prisoner was concerned to have a firearm for protection, even as a threat to others, rather than discharging it, then there was no need for him to have it loaded.
	
	
	In relation to that aspect of the matter, I would regard the objective seriousness of the offending as at the middle of that mid-range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	I bear in mind, so far as it may be relevant to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending, although it might be otherwise seen to be a subjective matter in one sense, that the prisoner had no prior findings of guilt for firearms offences, and as I have earlier pointed out, in light of his lack of involvement directly in the murder of the other gentleman, no alleged involvement with the use of firearms on previous occasions.
	
	
	In considering the standard non-parole period I am required to have regard to s 54A(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. That provides that for the purposes of sentencing an offender, a standard non-parole period represents the non-parole period for an offence in the Table to the Division, taking into account only the objective factors affecting the relative seriousness of that offence.
	
	
	Section 54B(2) now provides that the standard non-parole period is a matter to be taken into account by the Court in determining the appropriate sentence for an offender, without limiting the matters that are otherwise required or permitted to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offender.
	
	
	This latter provision, amended after the High Court decision in Muldrock (2011) 244 CLR 120, reflects upon the need to assess all considerations before fixing the appropriate non-parole period, the standard non-parole period operating as a form of guidepost, but not the starting point for determining the appropriate sentence in relation to the matter.
	
	
	I have dealt with, in passing, a number of the submissions that have been made by the parties. The only other matter I should refer to by way of material available to the Court are some statistics that were provided by counsel for the accused. They are very general in nature. They certainly confirm the fact that usually, although there are some exceptions, a term of imprisonment will be imposed for an offence of this type, although there are, on the matters reported to the Judicial Commission, a percentage of matters, slightly less than 23%, where full-time custody was not imposed by court order.
	
	
	I was also provided with some JusticeLink results, but the details of those cases are so sparse as to provide little in the way of guidance as to the range of penalties that may be imposed for an offence of this type. Every offence will differ from another matter involving other accused persons, for a range of reasons, both the objective seriousness and the subjective circumstances of the offender.
	
	
	With regard to that aspect, I am mindful of the observations of, for example, Spigelman CJ in Bloomfield back in 1998, and also the High Court in Hili, as to the limitations of statistics. But the statistics I was given in this matter really provided me with little assistance once it was clear, as it is the case in relation to Mr Allouche, that the threshold set down by s 5 of the Act had been passed, and it was required that a term of imprisonment be imposed.
	
	
	I should say, in relation to that aspect of the matter, and Mr Allouche would understand this, there is some aspects of his situation that are beyond his control, but make the current situation that he faces of going back into custody, if I may use the expression rather loosely, “somewhat unfortunate”.
	
	
	By the time he came before her Honour, he had been in custody almost two years. When her Honour dealt with him he was released to bail for the purposes of appearing in relation to this matter. He has been on bail, as I would understand it, barely a month.
	
	
	In the circumstances where he had been in continuous custody, I would imagine, although an offer of freedom would not be forsaken, the prospect of a short period of freedom only to be returned to custody would be a very daunting situation.
	
	
	I am not expressing sympathy for Mr Allouche. But I do understand the difficulty. I can tell him of a story of a man that I appeared for, convicted of two offences, one after a plea of guilty, one after a plea of not guilty. He appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal against both his conviction for one offence, and for the entirely separate offence in respect of the severity of the sentence.
	
	
	He appealed to the Court of Criminal appeal firstly in relation to the conviction and was acquitted on appeal. He was still serving, however, the sentence the subject of the sentence appeal. He came to thank me the day after his acquittal for his release from custody, in my office at the Aboriginal Legal Service, only to discover, to his horror, that he was still required to serve the sentence that he still had to have reviewed by the Court of Criminal Appeal. In other words, he had been wrongly released by the authorities. They had made a huge mistake. They got word of his acquittal and let him go before he had served the sentence that he was then otherwise currently serving.
	
	
	I had to sit down with him and explain the sad truth to him, that although he had been in custody for nearly two years, he had to go back to custody, surrender himself to the police, and go back to Long Bay Gaol until his appeal in the Court of Criminal Appeal was heard. And that he did. He did ask me if he could go and see his mother first, and then I took him up to the police station and the matter was finally resolved by the Court of Criminal Appeal.
	
	
	So I have had personal experience of a person coming out of custody and then coming back into custody. But, as Mr Allouche would understand, I am required, notwithstanding the understanding I have of the impact this will have on the prisoner, the responsibility of performing my duty to the best of my ability.
	
	
	With regard to each of the prisoners, of course, there is a requirement to have regard to s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, and of course, in this sentencing exercise, to varying degrees, all of the purposes of sentencing have some role to play, although less in respect of protection of the community in the case of Mr El Chami.
	
	
	With regard to the weight to be given to general deterrence, obviously, it will be greater in the case of Mr Allouche than Mr El Chami, having regard to the character of the weapon and the purpose of its possession, and the circumstances in which it was retained.
	
	
	With regard to both men, however, I am required, amongst the purposes of sentencing, to have regard to the promotion of their rehabilitation, in the case of Mr Allouche, knowing, of course, that he has had a far greater period in custody than Mr El Chami over the last two years.
	
	
	With regard to Mr Allouche I have referred to his criminal history. It is certainly not an aggravating factor under s 21A(2). There is, it can be fairly said, an absence of violence in his history and an absence of firearms type offences, but her Honour, Fullerton J, in her judgment referred to the aspect of the prisoner’s inability to comply with court orders on prior occasions.
	
	
	In the case of Mr El Chami, in my view his criminal history is not “significant”; findings of guilt without conviction, for which he was modestly fined in Queensland, and the special circumstances of him concealing a serious indictable offence, in my view do not disqualify him from consideration of a finding pursuant to s 21A(3) in mitigation, that he did not have a significant criminal history.
	
	
	If I might just deal with s 21A(3) in relation to both prisoners, as I am required to do particularly in the context of having regard to the standard non-parole period, in the case of each offender I find that the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was not substantial. It is not common that one would find that as a feature of such offending, but it is possible that it could occur.
	
	
	I am prepared to accept in each instance that the offence to which they have pleaded guilty, ‘each offence’ includes the one matter on a certificate in each case, was not part of planned or organised criminal activity. Of course, there is a live question as to how Mr Allouche gained access to such a firearm. However, I could not conclude that it is related to organised criminal activity.
	
	
	As I said, Mr El Chami does not have a significant record of previous convictions. He had no convictions, in fact, at the time of the commission of this offence, but I have already pointed out the conceal serious indictable offence matter was not then prosecuted.
	
	
	I am prepared to accept, in the case of Mr El Chami, that he was a person of good character. Taking all matters into account, I cannot find that in relation to Mr Allouche.
	
	
	I do, however, conclude in relation to both offenders that they are unlikely to reoffend, for somewhat different reasons. I got the impression in the conduct of the matter before me in relation to Mr Allouche, that his time in custody has been a salutary experience and that may operate to prevent him from offending in the future. In the case of Mr El Chami, of course, there is the absence of significant prior convictions.
	
	
	Both men have significant family support, and I accept both men come from law-abiding families as a general rule, and that will assist them.
	
	
	I am prepared to find that both offenders do have good prospects of rehabilitation. It was a matter favourably found in relation to Mr Allouche by Fullerton J, and I support her finding. Likewise, in the case of Mr El Chami.
	
	
	Both prisoners have expressed remorse in their apologies to the Court. In the context of all the material, I cannot find “remorse” as a mitigating factor. However, it must be fairly said the character of the offending is not one which readily lends itself to “remorse”. Where one has injured some other person or damaged some other person in some way, the issue of remorse, it seems to me, is a much more significant aspect of the sentencing process.
	
	
	Each offender has pleaded guilty, which is itself a mitigating factor.
	
	
	That brings me to a discount for the pleas of guilty. I am mindful that both men pleaded guilty in circumstances where they were arraigned in this Court after being committed for trial, but the delay in their pleas has to be seen in the context of them being charged with murder and the various processes involved before ultimately they pleaded guilty to far less serious offences, and having pleaded guilty on arraignment in the District Court in each case, not on the day that each matter was to commence for trial, I have formed the view that I should grant the offenders a discount greater than 10% as a recognition of the utilitarian benefit of their pleas of guilty.
	
	
	In that regard, of course, the application of a discount for the utilitarian benefit of the pleas of guilty is set down by the guideline judgment of Thomson and Houlton. The Court indicated the general range would be between 25% in the case of a plea entered at the first reasonable opportunity, and 10% for a plea entered at the time the matter was to commence at trial.
	
	
	These discounts, of course, are going to suffer something of a change with legislation planned by the New South Wales Government. I do not criticise the planned legislation. I merely make the point that the discretion available to a judge to grant particular discounts may not be as wide as it has been up till the present time once that legislation comes into force.
	
	
	But, noting the Crown’s submission that I should only give a discount of 10% in each instance, in my view, in the circumstances, particularly in the context of other, more serious, matters in some respects, waiting around at the relevant time, particularly charges of murder, a discount of 15% is a reasonable discount to give having regard to all the material available to me.
	
	
	I have already pointed out in relation to Mr Allouche, I take into account time spent in custody not otherwise attributable to other offending. In the case of Mr El Chami, there is only two days of custody, as I earlier mentioned, that is unaccounted for, and in the scheme of things, that is insignificant.
	
	
	In relation to Mr Allouche, I have indicated to him that I do not propose to impose any pecuniary penalty in respect of the matter on the s 166 certificate. The simple reason for that, if I have not already made it clear, is his possession of the firearm, loaded with those rounds of ammunition in it, is so bound up in the determination of the appropriate sentence for that offence, it would seem to me to amount to an element of double counting to impose some additional penalty. The point to be made is that for possessing ammunition without a licence or permit, there is no term of imprisonment permitted, as I understand it, there are only penalty units provided for as the maximum penalty. If there was a term of imprisonment I could have imposed a small term of imprisonment entirely concurrent with the other term of imprisonment. But to impose upon him some additional financial penalty that might affect his ability to get a driver’s licence or the like when he is released from custody is unnecessary.
	
	
	It is a slightly different situation with Mr El Chami. The ammunition in his possession had nothing to do with the “firearm”. It was a solitary projectile. There is no suggestion of anything sinister about it, although he obviously should not have had it, and in my view, in the case of Mr El Chami, a modest fine of $100 is sufficient penalty for that offending.
	
	
	The various matters that I have identified in my judgment, I trust have largely dealt with matters that have been the subject of submission by learned counsel for the Crown and learned senior counsel for each of the prisoners.
	
	
	Insofar as both offenders are relatively young men, I have taken that into account, a matter raised on behalf of each of the prisoners.
	
	
	The issue of totality, I have obviously taken into account as reflected in my earlier remarks relating to Mr Allouche.
	
	
	With regard to Mr Allouche, obviously I cannot find in his case that his record does not amount to a significant record of previous convictions, but as I said, I do not find his previous record as an aggravating factor.
	
	
	Likewise, in relation to the very helpful submissions of the Crown, the various matters identified by the learned Crown Prosecutor have been taken into account. I think that is self-evident. I have actually relied upon her analysis of aspects of the matter, particularly the principles. The facts in relation to the matter as she analyses them have also been taken into account.
	
	
	The learned Crown Prosecutor in fact, as I said, in her submissions pointed to details relating to the character of the firearm possessed by Mr El Chami in evidence given before Fullerton J, for which I am grateful, providing some additional material to that set out in the facts. In relation to that firearm I had the benefit of a photograph of the firearm as well.
	
	
	The learned Crown Prosecutor noted that Mr El Chami had been on bail since 29 January 2016, almost 19 months. He had been reporting daily, with a curfew from 9pm to 6am. He was not to be absent from the home during curfew hours unless with his parents or his wife, so he has been under quite strict conditions for an extended period of time, albeit not because of any delay in this matter but to allow the other, more serious matters, to be resolved.
	
	
	Likewise, Mr Allouche has been on bail for a short period of time, reporting daily, with a curfew. It is expected, of course, when people are on bail, that they will observe their conditions. It is the price people pay for being permitted to be free in the community, in circumstances where they might otherwise be in custody awaiting sentence.
	
	
	That having been said, I have taken that aspect of the matter into account.
	
	
	Mr. El Chami, do you mind standing up, thanks very much; I will deal with you first.
	
	
	In relation to the offence to which you pleaded guilty for which you were committed for sentence, you are convicted.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I order that you enter into a good behaviour bond for a period of two years from today.
	
	
	Conditions applying during the term of the bond are that, firstly, you are to appear before court if called to do so at any time. Secondly, you are to be of good behaviour. Thirdly, you are to advise the registrar or clerk of the criminal listing directorate of the District Court of Sydney, Downing Centre of any change of residential address. Fourthly, you are to accept the supervision and guidance of the New South Wales Community Corrections Service for such time as the service deems necessary, and obey all reasonable directions of the officers of that Service. You are to report to the Community Corrections office at Bankstown, which I think would be the nearest major regional location to Lakemba, within seven days of today.
	
	
	You can take a seat, sir.
	
	
	In relation to the matter on the s 166 certificate of possessing ammunition, you are convicted. You are fined the sum of $100. You are given 28 days to pay that.
	
	
	You can leave the dock, thanks very much. Just take a seat behind your counsel.
	
	
	I should say, Mr El Chami, I gave some thought to the alternative of imposing a term of imprisonment, but with a view to suspending it, but I determined ultimately that, firstly, in your case, s 5 had not been satisfied to warrant a term of imprisonment being imposed, but otherwise the term of imprisonment I imposed would have placed you on a bond for a shorter period of time than I can under s 9. In other words, I would have imposed a term of imprisonment of somewhere between 12 and 18 months, and I could only place you on a bond for the term of imprisonment, so I determined that I should place you on a bond to be of good behaviour for two years.
	
	
	Mr Allouche, if you do not mind standing up, sir.
	
	
	In relation to the offence on indictment of possessing a pistol, not being authorised to do so, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a period of one year six months imprisonment by way of non-parole period. That is to commence on 18 August 2016 and expire on 17 February 2018. I fix a balance of sentence of one year ten months, expiring on 17 December 2019.
	
	
	I have made a finding of special circumstances in your case. In my view, there is a requirement for an extended period of supervision to assist you to adjust to community living. This is a matter reflected, in fact, in the psychological report provided for you. I bear in mind, of course, technically, taking into account all the other time you have had in custody, this is the first term of imprisonment that you have had, and you require, in my view, particular supervision to assist you in relation to employment and training on your release to custody.
	
	
	In relation to the matter on the s 166 certificate, possess ammunition without holding a licence, you are convicted. Pursuant to s 10A, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, there is no further penalty required in that matter.
	
	
	Yes, Madam Crown, is there any technical matter I can correct?
	
	
	GAULD: No, your Honour. Could I just clarify the expiry date for the sentence? Was it 17 September 2019? I think I might have missed that.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: No, it is 17 December 2019. The balance of sentence is one year ten months. It is a total sentence of three years four months, representing a discount of 15% upon a sentence of four years imprisonment. But it is a balance of sentence of one year ten months; a non-parole period of one year six months expiring on 17 February 2018.
	
	
	GAULD: Thank you, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Do you understand the sentence, Mr Allouche? So you have got to serve another six months in custody, and I understand, of course, as I have already indicated, having been released from custody, you were no doubt hoping that all your legal worries for the short term were at an end. The circumstances are not such that I could allow you to remain at large, but I have made substantial recognition of matters favourable to you that warrant your release to be considered at an earlier time than might otherwise have been the case.
	
	
	Yes, thank you very much, you are excused. You will have to go with the officers.
	
	
	Mr El Chami, you will be required to go upstairs to the Registry at level 3, and you cannot leave the building until you enter the good behaviour bond that I have ordered.

6224183,R v Cahill [2017] NSWSC 1408,"Judgment – ex tempore (revised)


	
	INTRODUCTION
	
	
	On 16 October 2010 the Crown presented an indictment against William Cahill (to whom I shall refer as ""the accused"") containing three counts. The first count alleged that on 10 December 2015, at Camperdown in the State of New South Wales, he murdered Brian Anthony Liston. The second count alleged that on the same date, and at the same place he was armed with an offensive weapon, namely a knife, with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely to assault Paramjeet Pal. The third count alleged that on the same date, and at the same place, he was armed with an offensive weapon, namely a knife, with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely to assault Colin Semaan.
	
	
	On 5 December 2016 Hidden AJ found that the accused was unfit to be tried and referred the matter to the Mental Health Review Tribunal (“the Tribunal”): R v Cahill [2016] NSWSC 1697.
	
	
	On 27 January 2017, pursuant to s. 16 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (“the Forensic Provisions Act”) the Tribunal determined that the accused was unfit to stand trial, and would not become fit to be tried for the offence of murder within 12 months of the court's earlier finding of unfitness. On 28 July 2017 the Tribunal confirmed that the accused was unfit to be tried.
	
	
	It is in those circumstances that the matter comes before me as a special hearing pursuant to s. 19 of the Forensic Provisions Act, which is in the following terms:
	


19 COURT TO HOLD SPECIAL HEARING AFTER ADVICE RECEIVED FROM DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS

(1) If the Court receives a notification of a determination from the Tribunal under section 16 (3), 45 (3) or 47 (5) that a person will not, during the period of 12 months after the finding of unfitness, become fit to be tried for an offence, the Court:

(a) is to obtain the advice of the Director of Public Prosecutions as to whether further proceedings will be taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions in respect of the offence, and

(b) is to conduct a special hearing as soon as practicable unless the Director of Public Prosecutions advises that no further proceedings will be taken.

(2) A special hearing is a hearing for the purpose of ensuring, despite the unfitness of the person to be tried in accordance with the normal procedures, that the person is acquitted unless it can be proved to the requisite criminal standard of proof that, on the limited evidence available, the person committed the offence charged or any other offence available as an alternative to the offence charged.

(3) If the Director of Public Prosecutions advises the Court under subsection (1) (a) that no further proceedings will be taken in respect of the offence, the Director of Public Prosecutions is also to give that advice to the Minister for Police.

(4) Subsection (1) does not apply if the Court has already held a special hearing in relation to the offence concerned.   Having regard to the provisions of s 19, the Crown tendered a letter of 2 March 2017 from the Director of Public Prosecutions to the Registrar of the Court which became exhibit A. That letter confirmed, pursuant to the provisions of s 19, that the Director of Public Prosecution intended to proceed with the charges against the accused. The letter went on to request that the matter be listed for a special hearing as a matter of urgency. Pursuant to s 21A of the Act a special hearing is to be conducted by judge alone, unless an election is made by either the Crown or the accused that there be a jury. No such election was made by either party in the present case.


	
	Exhibit A is a letter from the Director of Public Prosecutions confirming, pursuant to s. 19(2), that the matter is to proceed.
	
	
	Pursuant to s. 22(1) of the Forensic Provisions Act, the following verdicts are available to be returned on a special hearing:
	



	
	that the accused is not guilty of the offence charged;
	
	
	that the accused is not guilty on grounds of mental illness;
	
	
	that on the limited evidence available the accused committed the offence charged; and
	
	
	that on the limited evidence available the accused committed an offence available as an alternative to an offence charged.
	



	
	As to (iv), manslaughter is an available verdict given that count 1 alleges murder.
	
	
	The evidence relied upon by the Crown is primarily contained in Exhibit B which consists of two lever arch folders of documents, together with two DVDs. The evidence in the case of the accused, which is Exhibit 1, consists of three reports of Dr Furst of 21 March 2016, 3 November 2016 and 23 August 2017, along with clinical notes compiled within Justice Health. Dr Furst and Dr Martin each gave oral evidence in the hearing before me.
	
	
	Pursuant to s. 21A of the Forensic Provisions Act, a special hearing is to be conducted by a judge alone unless an election is made by either the Crown or the accused that there be a jury. No such election was made in the present case. The statutory framework for a trial before a judge alone is provided by s. 133 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) (“the CPA”), which is in the following terms:
	


133 VERDICT OF SINGLE JUDGE

(1) A Judge who tries criminal proceedings without a jury may make any finding that could have been made by a jury on the question of the guilt of the accused person. Any such finding has, for all purposes, the same effect as a verdict of a jury.

(2) A judgment by a Judge in any such case must include the principles of law applied by the Judge and the findings of fact on which the Judge relied.

(3) If any Act or law requires a warning to be given to a jury in any such case, the Judge is to take the warning into account in dealing with the matter.


	
	Section 133(2) of the CPA requires that I expose my reasoning process by linking the relevant principles of law with the facts as I find them to be: Fleming v R (1998) 197 CLR 250; [1998] HCA 68 cited by Bathurst CJ in W v R [2014] NSWCCA 110 at [108]-[110]. That said, I am not required to express all of the matters which necessarily have to be stated to a jury unfamiliar with basic principles of the law: Markou v R [2012] NSWCCA 64 per Macfarlan JA (with whom R S Hulme J and R A Hulme J agreed) citing R v Winner (1995) 79 A Crim R 528 at 531.
	
	
	I should also note that the provisions of s. 133(3) of the CPA apply only to warnings, and do not require that every direction which would be given to a jury be referred to when giving a judgment in a trial before a judge alone: W at [111]. For present purposes I constitute the jury. I have taken all of those principles into account and have approached my judgment accordingly.
	
	
	THE FACTS
	
	
	The facts of the offending are not in dispute. The evidentiary material which establishes those facts may be summarised as follows.
	
	
	In December 2015 the accused lived in premises in Church Street, Camperdown. He had lived there since 15 May 2015. The premises comprised part of a residential unit block which had been acquired by the Metro Community Housing Cooperative, an organisation funded by the New South Wales Government for the purposes of providing transitional housing for people with mental health conditions.
	
	
	On the afternoon of 10 December 2015 the accused attended the Camperdown Community Mental Health Centre and requested to see his care co-ordinator, David Ball. Mr Ball was not there at the time, as a consequence of which the accused was seen by Tamara Suzuki, the acting team leader of the Sydney Local Health District Mobile Assertive Treatment Team. Ms Suzuki had apparently met the accused previously, firstly in 2008 at the Concord Centre for Mental Health, and again in about November 2015.
	
	
	It seems that the accused attended the Centre on that day seeking assistance regarding his finances. He said, in particular, that he had not received an anticipated payment of $400 from the NSW Trustee and Guardian which he had planned to use to purchase items for his premises on a shopping trip with Mr Ball that had been organised for the following day. Ms Suzuki made enquiries and informed the accused that she had been unable to contact the NSW Trustee and Guardian but had left a message and that someone from the team would contact him as soon as they had heard anything. The accused thanked her for trying and told her that his plans for the week were ""nothing, just shopping with David tomorrow"". The accused then left the centre.    
	
	
	The importance of the interaction between the accused and Ms Suzuki is that Ms Suzuki did not observe anything in terms of the accused's behaviour or demeanour at that time which might have indicated that he was acutely psychotic. In particular, he did not display any obvious agitation, frustration, irritability or mood fluctuation.
	
	
	At about 8.30pm on 10 December 2015, Brian Liston was at a bus stop on Salisbury Road, Camperdown. That bus stop was in close proximity to the building in which the accused resided. Mr Liston had attended a German class in premises nearby and was, it seems, waiting for the bus to take him home in accordance with the practice that he generally adopted.
	
	
	At about this time two members of the public, Joshua Smart and Terina Toko, were in a car which had parked on Mallett Lane, about three metres north of the intersection with Salisbury Road. Mr Smart was in the passenger’s seat and Ms Toko was in the driver's seat. Both of them saw Mr Liston sitting on his own at the bus stop.
	
	
	Mr Smart saw the accused leaving his premises. Both he and Ms Toko recognised him as one of the residents of the unit block. They observed that the accused was not wearing shoes at the time and they both watched him walk towards the bus stop where Mr Liston was sitting. Ms Toko observed the accused reach Mr Liston and appear to speak to him for about 5 seconds. She then saw the accused swing a knife in his right hand towards Mr Liston's chest.
	
	
	As soon as that motion occurred Ms Toko heard Mr Liston start screaming:
	
	
	“Why are you doing this?”
	
	
	Mr Liston then got up and started to run but fell over in the street. Ms Toko watched as the accused went over to Mr Liston and continued to stab him on the roadway. She said the stabbing motions were slow and long. She could see blood coming through Mr Liston's top. She said that this lasted for a few seconds before the accused walked away.
	
	
	Paramjeet Pal lived in a unit in the same unit block as the accused. Mr Pal had been inside his unit and had heard Mr Liston screaming:
	
	
	""Please stop stabbing me. Stop. Stop. Somebody help. Somebody help me. He is going to stab me to death"".
	
	
	Mr Pal looked out of the window facing onto Salisbury Road and saw the accused (whom he recognised from seeing him in and around the unit block) and Mr Liston having what he described as an “altercation” on the median strip. He described Mr Liston as apparently being in absolute fear, trying to get away from the accused. The accused began to chase Mr Liston. Mr Pal said he saw Mr Liston fall over the median strip as he was trying to run away, continuing to yell:
	
	
	""Get away from me"".
	
	
	Mr Pal saw the accused trip over Mr Liston and fall onto the road, following which the accused got up and stood over Mr Liston with one foot on either side of him and a knife in his right hand. Mr Pal said he saw the accused lean down and stab Mr Liston three times while he lay on the ground screaming. After the third stab Mr Pal said that the accused raised his hand and made a slashing motion with the knife across Mr Liston's body. Mr Pal was not sure whether this movement hit Mr Liston or not.
	
	
	Having made these observations Mr Pal ran outside and onto Salisbury Road. He saw that Mr Liston was covered in blood and he called out for people nearby to call police and an ambulance. He saw the accused standing on the other side of Salisbury Road with a man named Colin Semaan. At that time Mr Pal saw the accused lash out at Mr Semaan with the knife in his right hand, before turning around to walk towards Mallett Street. Mr Pal then ran towards the accused and kicked him in the back. The accused stumbled forward and then turned around and charged at Mr Pal, still holding the knife and slashing towards his direction. The knife did not strike Mr Pal. In the same motion the accused made another slashing attempt towards Mr Semaan.
	
	
	In the meantime, Mr Smart was observing what had occurred. He said that as the accused initially reached Mr Liston at the bus stop, he bent down slightly and struck Mr Liston in the chest with his right hand. Mr Smart did not see the knife at that stage and thought that the accused had punched Mr Liston. He said that Mr Liston jumped up and yelled out and tried to push the accused away. There followed a scuffle for a couple of seconds, after which the accused turned around and began to walk away from Mr Liston towards the unit block. It was at that stage that Mr Smart saw that the accused was holding a knife with what he described as a silver blade about 15 centimetres long which had ""a lot of blood on it"".
	
	
	According to Mr Smart, as the accused walked away Mr Liston yelled:
	
	
	""You've just stabbed me. I've been stabbed"".
	
	
	Mr Smart saw Mr Liston move his hands to his chest and stumble onto Salisbury Road. He saw the accused walk away for a short distance before turning around and running towards Mr Liston, holding the knife out in front of his body and pointing it at him. Mr Smart said that at one point Mr Liston threw one of his shoes at the accused, apparently in an effort to distract him. This was to no avail. Mr Liston tried to run around the accused but the accused grabbed him and took hold of the back of his shirt. Mr Smart said the accused then began to stab Mr Liston wildly with the knife as Mr Liston continued to struggle to get away.
	
	
	According to Mr Smart, the accused appeared to be stabbing Mr Liston randomly, anywhere he could land the knife. He said he saw the accused stab Mr Liston five to ten times in his upper and lower chest and the upper arms. Mr Liston broke free and attempted to run away across Salisbury Road but after a few steps he tripped and fell to the ground, landing onto his back. It was at that stage that Mr Smart got out of his car and approached Mr Liston to render assistance. At that point he saw the accused walk towards Mr Liston and bend down and take hold of his hair, using his left hand. He said that with his right hand the accused stabbed Mr Liston in the face and neck area very slowly and deliberately. Mr Liston yelled:
	
	
	""Why are you doing this to me?”
	
	
	The accused did not respond but pulled the knife out and stabbed Mr Liston again, slowly and deliberately in the same area, at which time Mr Smart said he saw blood coming from Mr Liston's neck. Mr Pal then intervened in the manner I have earlier described.
	
	
	After Mr Pal's intervention (and that of Mr Semaan) the accused was seen to walk in the opposite direction past Mr Pal towards the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital on Salisbury Road. Mr Pal followed him and he and another member of the public tried to corner the accused. As they did so they were yelling:
	
	
	""Drop the knife. Drop the knife"".
	
	
	At that point the accused turned around and threw the knife into the dirt on the nature strip under a tree. Mr Pal then grabbed hold of the back of the accused's shirt and remained there until the police came and arrested him a short time thereafter. Mr Pal observed that the accused sat on the ground and did not say anything. He described the accused’s eyes as being ""wide"". He said that he seemed very alert, and that he was looking at everything that was going on and listening to him (ie Mr Pal) but did not respond. He said that each time an onlooker would yell something, the accused would look directly up at them.
	
	
	Mr Semaan had been driving north along Salisbury Road and had seen a scuffle on the right-hand side of the roadway. He said that Mr Liston was lying on his back and the accused was crouched down with both knees on his chest, preventing him from getting up. He described the accused as thrusting into Mr Liston with his left hand in a motion that looked like he was stabbing or punching him, although at that stage Mr Semaan did not see a knife. He did, however, observe that at that time Mr Liston's shirt was covered in blood. Mr Semaan stopped his car, got out and yelled:
	
	
	""Get off him. Get off him"".
	
	
	At that stage he became aware of Mr Pal nearby yelling similar things. He said it was at that point that the accused got off Mr Liston and started walking towards the footpath. At that point, for the first time, Mr Semaan noticed that the accused was holding a knife which he described as being black with a metal blade about 15 centimetres in length.
	
	
	There were a number of other bystanders who also gave evidence of their observations. One of them, Golfo Deftereos, had been driving along nearby Carillon Avenue at the time with her boyfriend. As they approached Salisbury Road, Ms Deftereos saw Mr Liston sitting on the ground. She heard him screaming:
	
	
	""He stabbed me. He stabbed me. Help. Someone help me"".
	
	
	Mr Liston had blood on his left forearm. The accused was standing behind the bus stop for about 40 seconds before walking back towards Mr Liston again. Ms Deftereos described the accused's face as ""blank"" and she said that she did not hear him say anything.
	
	
	As the accused approached Mr Liston, Ms Deftereos heard him yell:
	
	
	""Help, he's coming back"".
	
	
	She said she saw Mr Liston trying to get up and move away from the accused but he kept falling. She said that when the accused reached Mr Liston he bent over and stabbed him 10 to 12 times in the torso with a swinging motion from the side. As he did so Mr Liston was again screaming for help. She said the knife appeared to her to be about 8 or 10 centimetres in length, with a black handle and a metal blade.
	
	
	It is not necessary for me to detail the observations of a number of other bystanders who witnessed the incident. I should simply note that those bystanders variously described the accused as ""expressionless"" and a person whose ""eyes (were) really wide"".
	
	
	Constables Merchant and Shepherd were driving along Carillon Avenue shortly before 9:00pm. In the course of doing so, they came across the scene of what had occurred. This was shortly before the incident was broadcast over the police radio. They saw Mr Liston lying on the street surrounded by a number of people, covered in blood. Constable Merchant's observations of Mr Liston's chest moving up and down appeared to be consistent with him breathing. Constable Shepherd commenced providing first aid to Mr Liston by, amongst other things, applying pressure to the wound on his chest. At this time Mr Liston's eyes were open but he was not responsive to voice commands.
	
	
	The witnesses who had observed the incident directed the attention of the two officers to the accused who was nearby. The officers were informed that the accused had been in possession of a knife. They saw the accused surrounded by a number of people and approached him, Constable Shepherd with her taser drawn and Constable Merchant with his firearm drawn. The officers yelled at the accused on two occasions to get to the ground. On the first occasion, he looked in their direction but did not respond and did not move. On the second occasion he initially failed to respond but then moved on to his knees and then on to his stomach.
	
	
	The accused was placed under arrest and taken to the police car. When police tried to put the accused into the rear of the police car he initially refused. They had to use a significant amount of force to push the accused into the rear of the car. A short time later another police officer reported to Constable Merchant that he had located a knife nearby.
	
	
	A paramedic team led by Liane Croft of the New South Wales Ambulance Service then arrived. Upon arrival, Ms Croft saw Dr Laura Hutchinson, an off duty Emergency Department specialist who had been driving past, checking Mr Liston's airway, with another person assisting by holding Mr Liston's body in position. She observed that Mr Liston appeared to have a number of wounds and that he was unconscious. Ms Croft and her team set about administering emergency treatment on the roadside to Mr Liston, including the insertion of a laryngeal mask in order to facilitate a patent airway. Defibrillation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was commenced before Mr Liston was transferred to the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. Upon arrival at the hospital, he was in cardiac arrest. Emergency treatment was administered to him but he died shortly before 10:00pm that evening.
	
	
	THE POST MORTEM EXAMINATION
	
	
	On the morning of 11 December 2015 an autopsy was conducted by Dr Istvan Szentmariay, a forensic pathologist, who subsequently provided a report to the coroner. That report forms part of the evidence before me.
	
	
	Commencing at page 6, Dr Szentmariay set out the injuries sustained by Mr Liston in the course of the attack. Those injuries were lengthy, but significantly Dr Szentmariay reported that there was a stab wound entry present over Mr Liston's left upper chest, which was centred 12 centimetres left of the midline, 3 centimetres above the left of the nipple and 143.5 centimetres above the sole. The wound measured 1.5 centimetres in length and was orientated between the 4 and 10 o'clock directions. The blunt (or squared) end was at the 10 o'clock direction and the sharp (or pointed) end was at the 4 o'clock direction. There was a mild upward tailing towards the 4 o'clock direction of 0.4 centimetres in length. Dr Szentmariay reported that the wound subsequently went through the underlying rib/intercostal space, and through the upper layer of the left lung and the lateral aspect of the pericardium sac, before subsequently entering through the anterior lateral aspect of the left ventricle, terminating the lumen.
	
	
	Dr Szentmariay described the direction of the wound path as being left to right, slightly downwards, and front to back. There were 150 millilitres of blood present in the left pleural cavity, and 50 millilitres of blood in the right. The estimated depth of the wound was 12-15 centimetres. The pericardium was widely open anteriorly and there was blood noted in both sides of the chest. It was in these circumstances that Dr Szentmariay concluded that the direct cause of Mr Liston's death was a stab wound to the heart.
	
	
	In those circumstances it is unnecessary for me to detail the other injuries and wounds which Dr Szentmariay found. It is sufficient, for present purposes, to note that the wounds to which Dr Szentmariay referred in his report are wholly consistent with the incident which I have previously described.
	
	
	THE ACCUSED’S INTERVIEW WITH POLICE
	
	
	After being taken into custody at the scene the accused was transferred to Newtown Police Station where he subsequently participated in an electronic interview with the police. The recording of that interview, as well as a transcript, forms part of the evidence before me. The recording was played in the hearing.
	
	
	I do not propose to recount the entirety of what the accused said when he was interviewed. However, because of the significance which was placed upon that evidence by Dr Furst (to whose opinions I will come) it is necessary for me to make reference to some of the answers given by the accused to questions asked of him in that interview.
	
	
	Commencing at Q. 33, police canvassed the subject of whether or not the accused was suffering from any mental illness. He told them that he was suffering from ""psychosis"". When asked at Q. 35 when he last took his medication, he responded by saying:
	
	
	""Not last night, the night before"".
	
	
	The questions then turned to the circumstances in which the accused had attacked Mr Liston (commencing at Q. 55):
	


Q55.    What's your understanding of the situation?

A.    That I'm going to gaol for a while. That's my thoughts.

Q56.    What do you think you're going to gaol for?

A.    Stabbing someone.

Q57.    Do you want to talk about that?

A.    No.

Q58.    Do you know who you stabbed?

A.    Pardon?

Q59.    Do you know who you stabbed?

A.    Um, I think it was someone of John Bochman's family.


	
	When asked (commencing at Q. 60) about “John Bochman” the accused told police (commencing at Q. 61) that Mr Bochman was someone he had lived with. When asked (at Q. 64) what had happened with Mr Bochman that made him (ie the accused) want to stab one of his family members, the accused responded by saying:
	


""I don't know, I thought it looked like a good-looking woman, and then looked a bit better, and I came out, and I, like, I saw an old man, so I started stabbing him. Smoking, I don't know why he would smoke"".


	
	When asked (commencing at Q. 69) how it made him feel when he saw a person smoking at the bus stop, the accused responded:
	


A.    Like, I came with a knife in my pocket but didn't know it, but then he stabbed me a bit with my knife, so I went crazy.

Q70.    And why did you come with a knife in your pocket?

A.    Didn't know it was there.

Q71.    Did you say you thought it was a woman?

A.    Yeah. Looked out my window and, yeah.

Q72.    And what made you think it was a woman?

A.    Cause she, saw a good-looking lady, that's what I thought. And then half an hour later I had another look, and I, there's someone else there, but she wasn't there anymore.

Q73.    Yeah. So it was two different people then?

A.    Yeah. No, the, it was only one each time.

Q74.    So when you saw the good-looking woman, how did that make you feel?

A.    Ah, it made me feel all right, but then I looked another time and, um, just went haywire.


	
	Later in the interview (commencing at Q. 146) the accused was asked about what happened after he had walked up to Mr Liston. The accused responded by saying:
	


A.    Ah, I was about to yell, but he, I think he pulled out my knife a bit and got me on my wrist.

Q147.    And how did he do that?

A.    Don't know.

Q148.    Did you say, did you say anything to him?

A.    No.

Q149.    Did, did he say anything to you?

A.    Ah, I stabbed him a bit with the knife and he yelled something like “piss off” or something.

Q150.    So you said that you walked up to him and he took the knife out of your pocket and stabbed you first. Is that what happened?

A.    Yeah.

Q151.    Why would he do that?

A.    Don't know.

Q152.    When you approached him, did you recognise him at all?

A.    Pardon?

Q153.    Did you recognise him when you, when you walked up to him and got closer?

A.    Yeah, he looked a bit similar to John Bochman.


	
	Later, when describing parts of the incident, the accused was asked the following (at Q. 179):
	


Q179. Do you remember if he said anything?

A.    Ah, something crystal meth, found a trap, got evil there, didn't even know him or something. And I think it was something to you people.


	
	When asked (at Q. 201) why he kept attacking Mr Liston, the accused responded:
	


""Um, just felt like it, if that's what you think I did"".


	
	Finally (at Q. 219 and following) the accused was asked:
	


Q219. Why did you stab him?

A.    Ah, Billy B just started making some bets back then.

Q220. Pardon? Billy?

A.    Billy made some bets.

Q221. Okay, who's billy?

A.    Billy Black(beard).


	
	It will be apparent that the accused’s answers are indicative of a considerable degree of what can only be described as disordered thought.
	
	
	THE ACCUSED’S CUSTODY
	
	
	Following the interview with police the accused was detained at Newtown Police Station pending an appearance before the Magistrate at the Newtown Local Court on the following day. The Custody Management Record prepared by the police noted that the accused appeared to be ""disorientated and confused"". Whilst in the dock at the station the accused was seen to pace up and down. A check of the police computer system indicated that he had a history of mental illness, possibly schizophrenia, and that he had previously been an inpatient at the Concord Mental Health Centre.
	
	
	The accused told police that he was taking Clozapine for psychosis. He said the last time he had taken medication was on the previous evening. When asked about his medication, the accused told the police that he ""takes meds but doesn't like them"". When asked about the type of psychosis from which he suffered and how it affected his mental state, the accused told the police:
	


""I just can't think every now and then"".


	
	A subsequent analysis of a blood sample taken from the accused confirmed the presence in his bloodstream of drugs used to treat schizophrenia.
	
	
	Other observations recorded in the Custody Management Record noted that whilst he remained in the dock in the police station the accused was seen to stand and walk around. Detective Constable Bale, who had been recalled to duty following the attack on Mr Liston, said that in the course of his observations of the accused that evening the accused was pacing around the dock and appeared dishevelled. Det. Bale said that as the accused paced back and forth in the dock he would sometimes stop and look up with his head tilted, staring toward the ceiling as if he was looking at something that was not there.
	
	
	THE ACCUSED’S APPEARANCE BEFORE THE MAGISTRATE
	
	
	At about 12.30pm on 11 December 2015 the police were asked to bring the accused into the Newtown Local Court to appear before the Magistrate. The accused was taken into the court room and was placed on a wooden seat, which was to the left of the Magistrate's bench. After being placed in that seat, the accused suddenly stood up and tried to leap over a barrier that was located directly in front of him. One of the police officers present, Constable Stacey, instantly grabbed the accused's right arm and tried to push him back into the seat. The accused began to resist, using his body weight to try and push Constable Stacey away. The Police Prosecutor, who was apparently present in court at that time, assisted Constable Stacey in attempting to restrain the accused. The accused continued to resist, resulting in Constable Stacey having to strike him to gain control over him. Constable Stacey described the accused as overpowering. He managed to pull the accused to the ground where he applied handcuffs to the front. He was unable to handcuff the accused to the rear because he kept pulling his arms away. The accused was then taken into another room where there was a cell. As a consequence of that incident, Constable Stacey suffered some minor injuries. The incident was captured on CCTV from cameras located within the Newtown Local Court. I have viewed that footage and what is depicted on it is consistent with the description provided by Constable Stacey.
	
	
	THE SEARCH OF THE ACCUSED’S PREMISES
	
	
	As part of their investigation police executed a warrant on the accused's premises. Whilst I do not propose to detail the entirety of what was found in the course of that search, there are two items of some significance.
	
	
	The first item was a spiral notebook in which there were a number of pages of handwriting. The first page, which is the only page to which I need to refer for present purposes, was headed with the words ""Serial Killer"" and contained the following:
	


""1 oysters you cannot eat;

2 there are people you shouldn't come across;

3 books you shouldn't read serial killer ones;

4 Chinese food you cannot eat;

5 there are popcorn shrimp in meals you cannot eat;

6 people you wouldn't mind sticking up for;

7 hash browns;

8 ways you can keep your thoughts hidden;

9 coke drinks you shouldn't drink;

10 different skills up your sleeve.”


	
	The second item was a novel by Colin Wilson entitled ""A Plague of Murder"". The front appeared to have an adhesive label attached to it of a kind generally issued by pharmacists when dispensing medication. That label contained the name of the accused.
	
	
	THE MEDICAL EVIDENCE
	
	
	Professor Greenberg, psychiatrist, provided a report to the Director of Public Prosecutions on 1 March 2016. The focus of that report was whether or not the accused was fit to stand trial. Professor Greenberg concluded that in light of the chronicity of his mental illness, it was unlikely (but not impossible) that the accused would become fit to plead and fit to stand trial in the next 12 months.
	
	
	On 16 November 2016 Dr Martin, a forensic psychiatrist, provided a report to the Director. On that occasion he expressed the view (at page 7) that the accused had schizophrenia. He described schizophrenia as a serious mental illness, characterised by experiencing psychotic symptoms such as being out of touch with reality and experiencing hallucinations and delusions, disorder of thought, and disorganised behaviour. Dr Martin concluded that, although the accused presented as a person with some understanding of the charges against him, of what it meant to plead, and of the general purpose of court proceedings, he had a limited capacity to understand and communicate as a direct consequence of a mental illness which Dr Martin described as ""treatment-resistant"". He concluded that on balance, it was likely that the accused was unfit to stand trial because of his impaired ability to follow proceedings, and his limited capacity to communicate with his lawyer and with the court.
	
	
	Dr Martin provided another report to the Director on 17 July 2017. The purpose of that report was to provide an opinion as to whether the accused may have available to him a defence of mental illness. Having reviewed lengthy background material, Dr Martin concluded (at page 2) that there was clear evidence of the accused having a serious mental illness in the weeks, months and years leading up to the offending. He said that there was consistent information establishing that the accused had a psychotic illness, with previous experience of psychotic symptoms, and disorganised and risky behaviour which had required involuntary hospitalisation and coercive treatment due to poor insight and a history of non-compliance with medication.
	
	
	Dr Martin thought that the fact that the accused had been prescribed Clozapine, which he said was reserved for serious and treatment-resistant psychotic illness, was strongly supportive of what he considered to be the severity of the accused's illness. He concluded that if it were the case that the accused were found by a court to have (as he put it) “physically committed the offending”, such offending was, from a clinical perspective, probably a result of a disordered mind such that the defence of mental illness could be argued.
	
	
	On 14 September 2017, Dr Martin provided a further report to the Director. That report included (insofar as he was able to obtain it) the accused's account of the events which led to Mr Liston's death. Dr Martin noted that the accused was ""extremely reluctant"" to talk about what had happened, but that on being encouraged to do so, he had said:
	
	
	""I suppose I was mentally ill because I was taking my medication"".
	
	
	Dr Martin confirmed that the accused's primary diagnosis was that of chronic schizophrenia. He described schizophrenia as a chronic vulnerability to experiences of psychosis which takes on a relapsing and remitting course. He commented that schizophrenia is a mental illness frequently associated with emotional disconnection, lack of emotional reciprocity and communication difficulties of a kind described in autistic spectrum disorders.
	
	
	Dr Martin expressed the view that the accused would satisfy what he understood to be the legal criteria for having ""a disease of the mind"". He said that it was very obvious that the accused had a major mental illness, namely chronic schizophrenia. He thought it highly likely that the accused would be seen as having a defect of reason as a direct consequence of that condition.
	
	
	Whilst he acknowledged that it was difficult to access the accused’s exact thinking processes around the time of the offending, Dr Martin was of the view that the accused's responses to questions put by him on examination were suggestive of a disorder of thought form, paranoia, and delusional misidentification, all of which were psychotic symptoms. He said that whilst it was difficult to know for certain the accused's thinking processes around the time of the offending, it was his opinion that it was extremely likely that the accused's capacity to appreciate the moral wrongfulness of his actions would have been significantly compromised. He concluded by stating that in his opinion, the accused's ability to behave rationally was significantly and detrimentally affected because of psychotic symptoms which were a part of his chronic schizophrenia, and that this was directly linked to the violence which resulted in Mr Liston's death. He concluded that the accused had available to him the defence of mental illness.
	
	
	Dr Furst also provided a number of reports to those acting on behalf of the accused. Those reports, as I have noted, form part of Exhibit 1.
	
	
	In the first of his reports of 21 March 2016, Dr Furst (who had had some prior connection with the accused) diagnosed that the accused was suffering from schizophrenia which was chronic and treatment-resistant, along with an autistic spectrum disorder. There appears to be a slight difference in the medical opinion as to whether or not the autistic spectrum disorder diagnosed by Dr Furst should be regarded as part of the schizophrenic condition suffered by the accused on the one hand, or as a differential diagnosis on the other. Dr Furst preferred the latter approach, Dr Martin the former. However it is clear that whatever approach is adopted, it makes no difference to the ultimate opinions expressed by either medical specialist.
	
	
	At the time of providing his report of 21 March 2016 Dr Furst expressed the view that the accused was not fit to be tried, and that in light of the chronicity of his schizophrenic illness and lack of improvement in the period of time leading up to that report, he was unlikely to become fit to be tried within the ensuing 12 months.
	
	
	Dr Furst's second report to the accused's solicitor was dated 3 November 2016. He confirmed his earlier diagnoses, and added a further diagnosis of a likely borderline intellectual function. He again expressed the view that the accused was not fit to be tried, and he thought it extremely unlikely that he would become fit to be tried in the ensuing 12 months.
	
	
	On 23 August 2017 Dr Furst provided his third report. In terms of the history of the offending, he recorded that the accused informed him that he had thought that the deceased had been ""stalking him"". He told Dr Furst:
	
	
	""I'm not sure if my mind was playing tricks. I never personally knew him. I only found out his name after my arrest"".
	
	
	When asked by Dr Furst why it was that he had approached Mr Liston, the accused replied:
	
	
	""I don't know. I just got a bit stupid that day. He was just down the street"".
	
	
	Dr Furst made specific reference to the accused's interview with the police, and to some of the questions and answers to which I have referred. He also made reference to the items recovered in the search of the accused's premises. He said that although the extensive writings in the notebook were suggestive of an interest in serial killers and/or fantasies or thoughts regarding killing, the contents were noticeably thought-disordered and illogical.
	
	
	Dr Furst had available to him a plethora of historical medical records pertaining to the accused, including those from Justice Health which form part of Exhibit 1. He concluded that the accused was suffering from a chronic and treatment-resistant schizophrenic illness which was severe in nature. He said that the accused remained chronically psychotic and impoverished in his thinking and that there were marked negative symptoms, poor communication skills, and self-neglect, despite being treated with Clozapine over a number of years. He also expressed the view that schizophrenia has been recognised as a disease of the mind.
	
	
	In Dr Furst's opinion, the accused was suffering from a defect of reason in the form of delusional thinking at the time of his offending, such that he was unable to reason about the wrongfulness of his actions with a moderate degree of sense and composure. It was on this basis that he concluded that the accused had a defence of mental illness available to him. Dr Furst expressed the view that because the accused was suffering from a disease of the mind in the form of treatment-resistant schizophrenia, he was probably unaware of the wrongfulness of his actions at the time.    
	
	
	Both Dr Martin and Dr Furst gave oral evidence in the hearing before me. Dr Furst confirmed (at T13.9) that he had been involved in cases relating to the accused for a number of years. He also confirmed (at T13.32) that the accused's mental health records dated back to 2006 and recorded the onset of psychotic symptoms at that time which were subsequently diagnosed as schizophrenia. Dr Furst confirmed (commencing at T14.34) the nature of a schizophrenic illness and its severity. He also confirmed (commencing at T14.41) that a schizophrenic illness is often characterised by a combination of different factors, including delusional beliefs, auditory hallucinations, disorder of thought, disorder of thought form, difficulties in processing information, and prominent mood symptoms.
	
	
	Importantly (at T15.12) Dr Furst said:
	


""…I should clarify in the case of Mr Cahill that, he has a more severe illness compared to most people with schizophrenia, so he's on the severe end of the spectrum, and his illness has also been treatment resistant which means failing to respond to two different classes of antipsychotic    medication in a reasonable timeframe, and hence the reason for treatment with the Clozapine medication, That’s C-l-o-z-a-p-i-n-e. So he’s, although that general description of schizophrenia is accurate, Mr Cahill is on the more extreme end of the illness.""


	
	Doctor Furst also expressed the view (at T15.46) that he suspected that the accused would always suffer from deficits of the kind that he had described, even when taking medication.
	
	
	Commencing at T16.7, Dr Furst confirmed his opinion that it was more likely than not that at the time of his offending, the accused was driven by delusional and/or paranoid thinking, was suffering from a defective reasoning in the form of delusional thinking, and was thus unable to reason about the wrongfulness of his actions with a moderate degree of sense and composure. He then said (at T16.24):
	


""…The delusions were most likely paranoid delusions and delusions of misidentification, and it's been very hard to extract information from Mr Cahill coherently, even since the time of his arrest when police interviewed him and when assessed by Justice Health, Doctors, myself    and other experts, but the absence of any logical reason, and especially looking at the police transcript and the recent DVD, they would be the most likely delusional ideations.""    


	
	In terms of the writing in the notebook seized from the accused's premises by the police, Dr Furst's view was that the writing became more disorganised and disjointed as it progressed. However he agreed (at T17.32) that there was evidence of disorganisation in the writing from the outset of the notebook, and that the thought process simply deteriorated as the writing progressed.
	
	
	Dr Furst also described the accused as being a person who had very poor insight. He said that as well as being on the more extreme end of a severe illness, he has little (if any) true insight into his condition, and the need for treatment.
	
	
	Dr Furst made reference (commencing at T18.47) to the evidence of Ms Suzuki, and the difficulties faced in assessing what was happening with the accused at a particular time. He said that there was evidence in the material that he had reviewed of attempts being made on a number of occasions to understand the accused's thinking about the events which led to Mr Liston's death. No logical narrative could be obtained, and there had been no breakthrough in the accused's treatment which would give any confidence that he would one day understand his thinking, delusions or hallucinations. He confirmed (commencing at T19.35) that there was a history of ""delusional misidentification"" which, on occasions in the past, had led to misidentification of one person for another.
	
	
	Dr Furst made reference, in particular, to that part of the accused's interview with police, in which he made reference to a person who he thought was “John Bochman”. He attached considerable significance to that interview in terms of assessing the accused's mental state at the time of the offending, bearing in mind that the interview was conducted within a very short time of the offence being committed. Commencing at T20.3, Dr Furst expressed the view that evidence of that nature tended to be the most reliable evidence in terms of determining a person's mental state a short time before. He confirmed that some of the answers given by the accused in the interview were reflective of disordered thinking. He referred, in particular, to Q. and A. 179, describing the accused's answer on that occasion as:
	


""…almost a textbook example of thought disorder, where the ideas are disjointed, there’s no connection between them, and it shows the state of mind he was in and also shows the state of mind where someone can't really reason about things with a moderate degree of sense and    composure

or even rationally, because their brain is disorganised.""    


	
	Dr Martin also gave evidence. He said (at T21.38) that there was ""no doubt"" that the accused suffered from schizophrenia. It should be emphasised that although Dr Martin reached the same conclusion as Dr Furst, he pointed out (at T22.19) that his opinion was independently formed, based upon the material with which he was provided and which he reviewed. That material included, importantly, the interview between the police and the accused which Dr Martin described as having been ""quite important"" in his assessment.
	
	
	THE DEFENCE OF MENTAL ILLNESS
	
	
	The opinions of Dr Furst and Dr Martin are expressed independently, and in unequivocal terms. They have been formed after each of them received a considerable amount of material dating back to 2006, documenting the accused's history of mental illness. That historical material is wholly consistent with the opinions that they have expressed. Those opinions squarely raise the defence of mental illness.
	
	
	The defence of mental illness is governed by the provisions of s. 38 of the Forensic Provisions Act which provides for the return of a special verdict:
	


38 SPECIAL VERDICT

(1) If, in an indictment or information, an act or omission is charged against a person as an offence and it is given in evidence on the trial of the person for the offence that the person was mentally ill, so as not to be responsible, according to law, for his or her action at the time when the act was done or omission made, then, if it appears to the jury before which the person is tried that the person did the act or made the omission charged, but was mentally ill at the time when the person did or made the same, the jury must return a special verdict that the accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness.

(2) If a special verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness is returned at the trial of a person for an offence, the Court may remand the person in custody until the making of an order under section 39 in respect of the person.


	
	In the event that a special verdict is returned pursuant to s. 38, then the provisions of s. 39 apply:
	


39 EFFECT OF FINDING AND DECLARATION OF MENTAL ILLNESS

(1) If, on the trial of a person charged with an offence, the jury returns a special verdict that the accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness, the Court may order that the person be detained in such place and in such manner as the Court thinks fit until released by due process of law or may make such other order (including an order releasing the person from custody, either unconditionally or subject to conditions) as the Court considers appropriate.

(2) The Court is not to make an order under this section for the release of a person from custody unless it is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the safety of the person or any member of the public will not be seriously endangered by the person's release.

(3) As soon as practicable after the making of an order under this section, the Registrar of the Court is to notify the Minister for Health and the Tribunal of the terms of the order.


	
	The onus of establishing the defence of mental illness falls on the accused, on the balance of probabilities: Mizzi v R (1960) 105 CLR 659; [1960] HCA 77; R v Ayoub [1984] 2 NSWLR 511. In order for the defence to be made out, there must be evidence that at the time of committing the relevant act(s), the accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from a disease of the mind, as to not know the quality and nature of the act that he was doing, or if he did know it, that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong: see R v M’Naghten (1843) 8 ER 718; R v S [1979] 2 NSWLR 1. Senior Counsel for the accused made it clear that he sought to rely on the second of those two limbs.
	
	
	The test was stated by Dixon J in R v Porter (1933) 55 CLR 182; [1933] HCA 1 at 189-190 in the following terms:
	


""The question is whether he was able to appreciate the wrongness of the particular act he was doing at the time. Could this man be said to know in this sense whether his act was wrong if through a disease or defect or    disorder of the mind he could not think rationally of the reasons which to ordinary people make that act right or wrong? If through the disordered condition of the mind he could not reason about the matter with a    moderate degree of sense and composure it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong. What is meant by “wrong”?

What is meant by wrong is wrong having regard to the everyday standards of reasonable people"".


	
	In terms of count 1 in the indictment, I am satisfied that the deliberate act of stabbing Mr Liston was committed by the accused, and that it caused Mr Liston's death. So much is clear, not only from the statements of the eyewitnesses, and the paramedics who treated Mr Liston at the scene, but also from the evidence of the treatment administered to him at the hospital and the report of the forensic pathologist. In terms of counts 2 and 3, I am satisfied that the accused was armed with a knife, which was subsequently recovered from the scene, and which he used to “lash out” at Mr Pal and Mr Semaan. It is clear from the evidence to which I have referred that the accused was so armed.
	
	
	Having reached that position, I must determine whether the accused is criminally responsible for his acts in each case, or in other words, whether he has established on the balance of probabilities that he was mentally ill at the time. If that is established, I must enter verdicts of not guilty by reason of mental illness. If not, it will become necessary for me to consider whether the Crown has established, beyond reasonable doubt, that the acts of the accused in each case were accompanied by the relevant mental state: R v Minani (2005) 63 NSWLR 490; [2005] NSWCCA 226 at 498; [32] per Hunt AJA, Spigelman CJ and Howie J agreeing.
	
	
	I have already referred at some length to the evidence of Dr Martin and Dr Furst. There has been no challenge to their opinions. Indeed, both the Crown and senior counsel for the accused submitted that such opinions ought be accepted. Importantly, there is complete unanimity in those opinions. If evidence of that kind is unanimous, it is not open to reject it in the absence of material which might cast some doubt on it: R v Afele [2014] NSWSC 366 at [68] and the authorities cited therein. There is no medical evidence which casts any doubt upon the opinions of Dr Martin or Dr Furst in this present case. I therefore have no reason to reject those opinions and I accept them.
	
	
	I should also make three further observations. Firstly, the objective appearance of the accused on the night in question as described by bystanders is consistent with the medical opinions which have been expressed. Secondly, the accused's demeanour in the course of the interview with police, and the answers that he gave to the questions asked of him, do nothing other than support the conclusion that at the time of the offending, he was suffering from significant disordered thought. Thirdly, the evidence concerning the accused's demeanour, firstly at the police station on the evening of his offending, and in court the next morning, provides further support for these conclusions.
	
	
	I am therefore satisfied that at the time of the offending the accused was suffering from a schizophrenic illness. I am satisfied that, in the terms adopted by Dixon J in Porter, the accused did not know that what he was doing was wrong, having regard to the everyday standards of reasonable people. The schizophrenic illness from which the accused was suffering from at the time of the offending produced the symptomatology to which Dr Furst and Dr Martin referred. That symptomatology included thought disorder, hallucinatory beliefs, difficulty in processing, and delusional beliefs. I am satisfied, based on the opinions of Dr Martin and Dr Furst, that at the time of the offending, the accused was driven by delusional thinking and was, as a consequence, not able to reason about the wrongfulness of his actions on that occasion. In all of these circumstances, I am satisfied that the defence of mental illness has been established on the balance of probabilities.
	
	
	Having reached that finding, it will be necessary for me to make orders giving it effect. However before I do so, there are some final observations that I wish to make.
	
	
	I am aware that yesterday and today a number of members of Mr Liston’s immediate family, and a number of his close friends, have been in court. Each and every one of you has heard the evidence, and the reasons that I have given this morning leading to the conclusions at which I have arrived. I can barely imagine the torment through which you have been put. I have some appreciation of the fact that such torment has, in more than one sense, been exacerbated by hearing the evidence that you heard yesterday, and the reasons that I have given this morning. The orders that I am about to make will have the effect of closing, as it were, this chapter of what happened on that evening in December of 2015. I do not, in saying that, pretend in any way that the conclusion of these proceedings will provide complete closure for any one of you. However, it is my hope that it will provide some mechanism, however small, to assist you to cope and deal with the grief that each and every one of you is suffering. In all of those circumstances, I extend not only the sympathy of the court, but my own personal sympathy and condolences to you, for what could only be described as an unimaginable loss.
	
	
	I make the following orders:
	



	
	I find the accused not guilty of each of counts 1, 2 and 3 in the indictment on the grounds of mental illness.
	
	
	I order that the accused be detained pursuant to s. 39 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 in an appropriate correctional centre or in such facility as the Mental Health Review Tribunal may determine until he is released by due process of law.
	
	
	I direct the Registrar to notify the Minister for Health and the Mental Health Review Tribunal of these orders.

6224194,KN v R [2017] NSWCCA 249,"Headnote

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

The applicant was indicted to stand trial on four counts of sexual offences relating to one complainant. On the first morning of trial, the Crown made an application for the complainant and a complaint witness to give evidence via audio visual link (AVL) from their residential addresses in foreign jurisdictions. The following day, the Crown informed the trial judge that it proposed to use the program “Jabber” for this purpose. The applicant opposed the application and applied for an adjournment of the trial. The trial judge refused the application and made an ‘order’ that the complainant and the complaint witness could give evidence via AVL as proposed.

The applicant sought an order staying the trial pending determination of his application for leave to appeal pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 5F, which provides for an appeal against “an interlocutory judgment or order”. He also sought orders refusing the Crown’s application for the evidence of the complainant and the complaint witness to be heard by way of “Jabber” technology. The application was heard urgently. At the time of the hearing the jury had already been empanelled and the trial was due to continue that day.

The Court held, refusing the application:

(1)   The essence of a court order is that it is a command to someone that a thing be done or not done and is enforceable by the court should there be non-compliance, including by way of contempt. [56]

   AF v R [2015] NSWCCA 35; Cheikho v R (2008) 75 NSWLR 323; [2008] NSWCCA 191; R v Bozatsis and Spanakakis (1997) 97 A Crim R 296; R v Steffan (1993) 30 NSWLR 633, applied

(2)   A court’s acceptance that particular technology such as “Jabber” would be an appropriate and permissible means by which evidence may be given is not an “order”. [57]

(3)   Subject to the requirements of the legislation, the decision to permit evidence to be given by AVL is a matter for the primary judge’s discretion in the circumstances of a particular case. [66]

   ASIC v Rich [2004] NSWSC 467; 49 ACSR 578; Kirby v Centro Properties Limited [2012] FCA 60; 288 ALR 601, cited

(4)   While it has sometimes been acknowledged that the question whether the credibility of the witness is in issue might be relevant to the decision to use AVL, there are numerous decisions where it has been held that the demeanour of a witness could be adequately assessed by AVL. It was apparent that the trial judge was satisfied that the jury could adequately assess the witnesses’ evidence given by AVL. [67]-[68]

   ASIC v Rich [2004] NSWSC 467; 49 ACSR 578; Hughes v Whittens Group Pty Ltd [2017] NSWSC 329; Kirby v Centro Properties Limited [2012] FCA 60; 288 ALR 601; R v Lodhi [2006] NSWSC 587; (2006) 163 A Crim R 488; R v Qaumi and Ors (No 9) [2016] NSWSC 171; R v Wilkie, R v Burroughs, R v Mainprize (2005) 193 FLR 291; [2005] NSWSC 794, cited

(5)   In circumstances where it is both the responsibility of and solely within the fiat of the trial judge to control the processes and procedures in the court so as to ensure there is a fair trial, there was no error in her Honour’s acceptance that the taking of the evidence via AVL could be conducted using the Jabber program. [74]

(6)   The trial judge did not err in the exercise of her Honour’s discretion in refusing the adjournment application and the applicant did not make out any other case for the grant of a temporary stay. [75]

Judgment


	
	THE COURT: The applicant was indicted to stand trial on four counts of sexual offences relating to one complainant. His trial was listed in the District Court to commence on 18 September 2017. On the first morning of the trial, the Crown made an application for the complainant and a complaint witness to give evidence via peer-to-peer desktop AVL software, at their respective residential homes in foreign jurisdictions. The application was supported by the affidavit of the solicitor with the carriage of the matter in the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. On 19 September, the Crown informed the trial judge that it proposed to use the program “Jabber” for this purpose.
	
	
	The applicant opposed the application and also made an application for the adjournment of the trial. On 20 September 2017, the trial judge refused the applicant’s application for an adjournment and made ‘orders’ that the complainant and the complaint witness could give evidence via AVL from remote locations in overseas jurisdictions pursuant to the Evidence (Audio and Audio Visual Links) Act 1998 (NSW), s 5B.
	
	
	By notice filed 21 September 2017, the applicant sought, inter alia, an order staying the trial pending determination of his application for leave to appeal pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 5F (the application for leave to appeal). The application for a stay was heard urgently by the Court on 22 September 2017. At this time the jury had already been empanelled and a witness, Dr Tran, was due to give evidence that afternoon and was not otherwise available to give evidence during the expected duration of the trial.  After hearing argument, the Court refused the stay and reserved its reasons. The Court now gives it reasons for refusing the stay.

	The Criminal Appeal Act, s 5F(3) provides for an appeal, with leave, to the Court of Criminal Appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order made in proceedings in, relevantly, the District Court.
	


Leave to appeal under s 5F


	
	In Slotboom v R [2013] NSWCCA 18 this Court, at [6]-[7], confirmed the principles that apply in determining whether to grant leave to appeal under s 5F(3) as stated in Agius v R (2011) 80 NSWLR 486; [2011] NSWCCA 119 and in R v Alexandroaia (1995) 81 A Crim R 286.
	
	
	In Agius, the Court said at [10]:
	


“This Court has said that leave will only be granted where the decision which is the subject of the s 5F application is attended with sufficient doubt so as to warrant the matter being argued on appeal (R v Steffan (1993) 30 NSWLR 633 at 644-645), or where the interests of justice otherwise require the intervention of the Court at this stage of the proceedings (R v Matovski (1989) 15 NSWLR 720 at 723; R v Dinh [2000] NSWCCA 536; (2000) 120 A Crim R 42 at 48 [34]). The Court should bear in mind the undesirability of interrupting criminal proceedings by the bringing of a s 5F application: R v Einfeld [2008] NSWCCA 215; (2008) 71 NSWLR 31 at 37 [23]-[25].”


	
	Where the application relates to the discretionary decision of a trial Judge refusing to adjourn a criminal trial the governing principle, as stated in Alexandroaia at 290, is as follows:
	


“Whether or not an adjournment should be granted is a matter which lies within the discretion of the trial judge. An appeal based upon the judge’s refusal to grant an adjournment is thus one against the exercise of a discretion, and it will be allowed only where it has been established that the judge has erred in the proper exercise of that discretion. There is a strong presumption in favour of the correctness of the decision, but that presumption will be overcome where it is shown that the judge has acted on some wrong principle, or has given weight to extraneous or irrelevant matters, or has failed to give weight or sufficient weight to relevant considerations, or has made a mistake as to the facts. Even if the precise nature of the error may not be discoverable, it is sufficient that the result was so unreasonable or plainly unjust that the appellate court may infer that there has been a failure properly to exercise that discretion. An appellate court may not, however, substitute its own findings of fact for those of the primary judge unless there was no evidence to support a particular finding, or the evidence is all one way or the judge has misdirected himself in relation to those facts. If the appellate court is satisfied that there has been an injustice to one of the parties as a result of the judge’s exercise of discretion, it is under a duty to review the order made.” (citations omitted)


	
	As is apparent from this passage, the relevant test is whether error has been demonstrated in accordance with the principles in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499; [1936] HCA 40.
	
	
	In his application for leave to appeal, the applicant, in addition to the order for a stay, sought the following orders:
	


“2.   An order refusing the application for the evidence of [the complainant] to be heard by way of ‘Jabber’ from her residential address on her personal computer in a foreign jurisdiction.

3.   An order refusing the application for the evidence of [the complaint witness] to be heard by way of ‘Jabber’ from an unknown location on her personal computer in a foreign jurisdiction.”


	
	Six of the applicant’s 14 proposed grounds of appeal were specifically directed to her Honour’s ‘order’ relating to the use of the AVL technology, although these grounds also relate to the refusal of the adjournment. The other grounds were directed to the alleged errors in refusing the adjournment.
	


Temporary stay


	
	Because the application before this Court on 22 September 2017 was only concerned with whether to grant a temporary stay pending the hearing of the applicant’s application for leave to appeal, it is appropriate at the outset to refer to the principles governing the grant of a temporary stay. Those principles were summarised by Bathurst CJ, Hulme and Bellew JJ agreeing, in Macdonald v R; Maitland v R [2016] NSWCCA 306 at [140]:
	


“It is well established that the Court has inherent power to direct a temporary stay of proceedings to prevent injustice and that the Court has a responsibility to avoid unfairness to an accused by, if necessary, imposing a temporary stay to avoid such unfairness: Medaris v Lars Halvorsen & Sons Pty Ltd (1943) 44 SR (NSW) 71 at 76; Jago v District Court of NSW (1989) 168 CLR 23; [1989] HCA 46 at 47. However, as was stated in X7 v R [2014] NSWCCA 273; (2014) 292 FLR 57, a stay will only be granted to the extent necessary to relieve against unfair consequences: at [91]–[92], [114]; see also Redacted Judgment [2015] NSWCCA 281 at [108]–[110].”


	
	In R v Seller; R v McCarthy (2015) 89 NSWLR 155; [2015] NSWCCA 76 at [128], Bathurst CJ, Fullerton and Bellew JJ agreeing, said:
	


“The question of whether a temporary stay should be imposed arises if the court is of the view that it is inappropriate to grant a permanent stay but notwithstanding, some relief is necessary to ensure a fair trial.”

Trial judge’s reasons


	
	As indicated, her Honour was dealing with two applications. The first was an application that the complainant and the complaint witness give evidence via AVL from their homes overseas. The second was the applicant’s application for an adjournment. The trial judge, at the commencement of her judgment, observed that the matter had been set down for trial at a directions hearing on 18 November 2016 and that the Crown had indicated, on 18 September 2017, that it was ready to proceed.
	
	
	The grounds upon which the applicant sought to have the trial adjourned were identified by her Honour as follows:
	


“1.   The Court has no jurisdiction under s 294B of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 to order that the complainant gives evidence by AVL facilities from Germany.

2.   It was not in the interests of justice for [the complaint witness] to give evidence via AVL from a link in Austria as the defence did not have the material, being the contents of [the complaint witness’] phone, to cross-examine [the complaint witness]. Further, the defence did not have the opportunity to get material from either the complainant or [the complaint witness’] phone regarding conversations with the accused and between each other.

3.   The defence had only recently been served with the statement of [G] relating to an alleged admission made by the accused.

4.   The defence have not been provided with Cellebrite records relating to the accused’s phone.

5.   There was no statement from a person known as [YR].

6.   A subpoena served on the commissioner of police, on 8 September, was not adequately complied with.

7.   The complainant’s position in Germany put the accused at a disadvantage, as the defence wish to show a video of approximately 20 minutes and other documentation to the complainant in cross-examination and [counsel] questioned the ability of the Court to control the process.

8.   The defence had not had access to the accused’s camera or to the accused’s phone.”


	
	Her Honour dealt with each basis of the adjournment application seriatim.
	
	
	In relation to the first, second and seventh bases of the application, her Honour observed that the complainant was entitled to give evidence pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), s 294B, from a place other than the courtroom. Her Honour considered that as nothing in s 249B limited the location from which a complainant could give evidence, the evidence could be given from any place, including from outside Australia. Her Honour was of the opinion that pursuant to s 294B(3)(a), the evidence could be given via AVL.
	
	
	Her Honour stated, in accordance with the statutory requirements of s 294B, that she was not satisfied that there were special reasons in the interests of justice for the complainant’s evidence not to be given by means of AVL technology “from a place other than the courtroom”. Her Honour was also of the opinion that the Evidence (Audio and Audio Visual Links) Act did not limit the availability of AVL facilities for witnesses outside New South Wales and Australia.
	
	
	Having decided that the complainant’s evidence could be given via AVL, it was necessary for her Honour to consider the applicant’s opposition to the use of Jabber technology as proposed by the Crown. Her Honour had been informed that the Jabber programme had been tested for the purposes of its use in the trial.
	
	
	Her Honour noted that the District Court had successfully used the Jabber program and stated that from enquiries she had made, she had been informed that the Jabber software accommodated the viewing of videos and documents on a computer screen in the remote location, that being one of the bases for the applicant’s objection as to its use. Her Honour also stated that the system would have to be tested just prior to the complainant giving evidence.
	
	
	Her Honour stated that if she was wrong as to the jurisdictional reach of s 294B, she was of the opinion that the court had jurisdiction pursuant to s 5B of the Evidence (Audio and Audio Visual Links) Act to order that a person may give evidence outside New South Wales, including a place outside Australia if the necessary facilities were available, provided the provisions of the section were satisfied and the court was satisfied that it was in the administration of justice to make an order in respect of the evidence of the complainant.
	
	
	In determining that the evidence of the complainant and the complaint witness could be given via AVL, her Honour stated that she took into account any disadvantage to the accused, the public interest generally, the prosecution interest and the witness’ interest. Her Honour noted that both the complainant and the complaint witness were young females who were not Australian citizens and who had both indicated they did not wish to return to Australia to give evidence.
	
	
	Her Honour further stated that she had taken into account the nature of the trial, namely, a sexual assault trial, together with the cost of bringing witnesses to Australia and any delay which an adjournment might cause. In that regard, her Honour noted that if the trial did not proceed, the next available date would be July 2018. Her Honour also had regard to the fact that there was no power to compel the complainant or the complaint witness to travel to Australia to give evidence.
	
	
	Her Honour stated that she had “weighed up” these matters in relation to any unfairness to the accused and had taken into account any disadvantages to which the technology may give rise in relation to the witnesses giving evidence via AVL. Her Honour’s concluded view was the applicant would not get an unfair trial and that it was in the interests of justice that both the complainant and the complaint witness give evidence via AVL.
	
	
	The third basis for the adjournment application related to the recent service of a witness statement in which it was alleged the applicant had made an admission. Her Honour considered that the question of the admissibility of the admission was not a reason for an adjournment and could be dealt with in the course of the trial.
	
	
	The fourth basis related to the Crown’s failure to provide the defence with Cellebrite records relating to the applicant’s phone. Her Honour noted, however, that those records had been obtained and arrangements would be made for the defence to view them.
	
	
	The fifth basis was a complaint as to the absence of a witness statement from YR. Her Honour found that YR was not a complaint witness and noted that the Crown had informed the court that it was for that reason that there was no statement from her. For that reason, her Honour considered that the absence of any statement from YR was no reason to grant an adjournment. Her Honour commented that if the defence considered YR to be an important witness in their case, they could make arrangements to have her give evidence.
	
	
	The sixth basis related to the alleged inadequate response by the police to a subpoena. Her Honour noted that she had been informed that the subpoena had sought downloads of the complainant’s and the complaint witness’ phones, including all WhatsApp messages, and that those documents were not produced because they were not in existence.
	
	
	As to the eighth basis upon which the adjournment application was made, her Honour noted that the officer-in-charge would assist the defence in accessing the applicant’s camera and phone and that she would give the defence time to look at them.
	
	
	Her Honour then dealt with further matters that had been raised in the course of argument. The first related to photographs referred to in the complainant’s statement. Her Honour observed that it was not obvious from the statement that the photos had been taken on the complainant’s phone and noted that the defence had only raised the matter that morning. It was for these reasons that the prosecution had not made any inquiries of the complainant about any photographs taken by the applicant on her phone.
	
	
	Her Honour next dealt with the question of the translation of some text messages. Her Honour then returned to the use of the Jabber programme and the download from the Supreme Court website to the effect that the Supreme Court did not support its use. She observed, however, that the programme had been tested and was used in the District Court.
	
	
	Her Honour rejected that it ought to have been part of the Crown investigative processes to have taken downloads of the entire contents of the phones of the complainant and the complaint witness and considered that the relevant screenshots had been obtained.
	
	
	Her Honour saw no reason why the trial should not proceed and thus declined the application for the adjournment. Her Honour then stated:
	


“I make orders that the complainant can give evidence via AVL from a remote location in Germany, and the [complaint witness] can give evidence from a remote location via AVL in Austria pursuant to s 5B of the Evidence (Audio and Audio Visual Links) Act.”

Applicant’s submissions


	
	The applicant contended that her Honour erred in her interpretation of the Criminal Procedure Act, s 294B and, in particular, as to whether the section applied if evidence was to be taken outside Australia. The applicant further contended that her Honour erred in seeking to combine the provisions of s 294B and s 5B of the Evidence (Audio and Audio Visual Links) Act.
	
	
	The applicant further submitted that the Jabber technology was not technology that enables “communication between [a place other than the courtroom] and the courtroom” within the meaning of s 294B, nor did it come within s 5B. According to the applicant, the Jabber technology did not fall within s 294B, as it was:
	


“… ‘peer-to-peer desktop AVL software’ on the personal computer of the complainant, [to be used] without any supervision by the Court at the place where the complainant was to give evidence.”


	
	The applicant also submitted that the following matters were relevant to her Honour’s discretion to make an order that the evidence be given by way of AVL and should have caused her to refuse the application. First, the application for the use of AVL facilities was only made on the first morning of the trial. Secondly, it was proposed that the evidence would be given from the personal computers of the complainant and the complaint witness. Thirdly, the technology to be used was Jabber, a peer-to-peer desktop AVL proprietary software. Next, it was intended that the evidence would be given from the respective homes of the complainant and the complaint witness, without the attendance of any governmental or other official. Finally, it was proposed that a support person might be present in the room with the complainant or the complaint witness when giving evidence. The applicant also submitted that the use of Jabber software was inappropriate in circumstances where the Supreme Court did not endorse the use of this particular software.
	
	
	The applicant also complained that in opposing the use of the AVL facilities he had had to reveal part of his defence, and in particular, his proposed cross-examination of the complainant by reference to CCTV footage which indicated behaviour inconsistent with her allegations. The applicant also complained that the secrecy of his material to be used in cross-examination would be compromised under the orders made by the trial judge in circumstances where documents were to be forwarded to the complainant and the complaint witness on their personal emails.
	
	
	The applicant made an added complaint that there was no process whereby there could be any guarantee that the court’s jurisdiction was not being abused or misused and where there was no control of the privacy of the documents. Further, concern was expressed as to the capacity of the complainant and the complaint witness to give evidence in the early hours of the morning, given that it was expected that their evidence would take approximately a day. The applicant maintained his complaint about the late service of evidence, including the evidence of Dr Tran and the failure to investigate the whereabouts of YN. He also emphasised that the complainant’s credit was in issue.
	
	
	Another matter raised by the applicant was his contention that the Crown had not fully answered the subpoena that had been issued to the police. This included the failure to produce downloads from the phones of both the complainant and the complaint witness and a camera used by the complainant on the day after the alleged assaults.
	
	
	The applicant informed the Court that in the course of argument before the trial judge in relation to the non-production of this material, it had been revealed that the phones had been returned to the complainant and the complaint witness, as had the camera, and that only a few snapshots had been downloaded, whereas, according to the applicant, numerous photographs had been taken on the complainant’s camera and phone, after the conduct alleged in the indictment. This material had not been produced or attempted to be produced by the prosecution.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the consequence, if evidence was allowed to be given by AVL, would be that the jury could hear evidence from the complainant and the complaint witness in circumstances where the applicant was deprived of material upon which he would otherwise have sought to cross-examine. He also complained that he was forced to undergo his trial without the proper and usual disclosure of material. It was submitted that in all the circumstances, the trial judge had erred in allowing the trial to proceed.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that it was the accumulation of all of these factors which meant that there was a potential that he would not have a fair trial.
	


Crown submissions


	
	The Crown submitted that it was important to distinguish the two applications that were determined by her Honour. The first was an application by the Crown that the evidence of the complainant and the complaint witness be given by AVL using Jabber technology from their respective homes in Germany and Austria. The second application was the applicant’s application for adjournment.
	
	
	As to the first application, the Crown submitted that her Honour’s ‘order’ that the evidence of the complainant and the complaint witness could be given from a remote location via AVL was not an interlocutory judgment or order within the meaning of the Criminal Appeal Act, s 5F in respect of which leave to appeal may be sought.
	
	
	The Crown accepted that the refusal of an adjournment application was an interlocutory order within the meaning of the section. The Crown submitted that the question of the use of AVL facilities had not been the basis of the adjournment application. The Crown further submitted that it was necessary for the applicant to establish error in accordance with the principles in House v The King and that he had failed to do so.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that as her Honour made the order for the use of AVL under the Evidence (Audio and Audio Visual Links) Act, s 5B, any issue in relation to the extra-territorial operation of the Criminal Procedure Act, s 294B fell away. Further, the Crown pointed to her Honour’s comments that the AVL link would be tested immediately prior to the witnesses giving evidence. This was relevant, in the Crown’s submission, as it was apparent that her Honour was at all times cognisant of the need to keep under review the trial processes so as to ensure the fairness of the trial.
	
	
	The Crown also pointed out that during the course of the hearing of the application before the trial judge, the Crown had offered to ascertain whether there were alternative facilities whereby the evidence might be given, but that her Honour had decided to commit the evidence to be given from the homes of the two witnesses using the Jabber technology.
	
	
	In response to the complaint that the applicant did not have access to the complainant’s phone, the Crown submitted that the police had extracted what was relevant and served that upon the applicant. The Crown contended that it was a matter of mere speculation as to what other material was on the complainant’s phone and to the extent that the applicant wished to test that matter, it could be the subject of cross-examination.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the late service of the statement of Dr Tran did not give rise to any prejudice. The applicant was aware from the prosecution’s notice that had been served on him pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Act, s 142, that the Sexual Assault Investigation Kit (the SAIK kit) was to be tendered. The evidence of Dr Tran, who had taken the DNA swabs, related to early complaint and the continuity of the exhibit evidence and accordingly was not contentious. Dr Tran’s evidence was not proposed to be relied on as medical evidence as to whether any sexual contact between the applicant and the complainant was consensual.
	


Determination


	
	The application before the Court was for a temporary stay of a criminal trial that was about to commence in the District Court pending the determination of the applicant’s application for leave to appeal pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act, s 5F. The application for leave to appeal, by its terms, was directed to the trial judge’s determination that the evidence of the complainant and the complaint witness could be taken via AVL using the Jabber program. In making that determination, her Honour first had regard to the Criminal Procedure Act, s 294B, but proceeded to make ‘orders’ under the Evidence (Audio and Audio Visual Links) Act, s 5B.
	
	
	Pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Act, s 294B(3), a complainant in proceedings in respect of a prescribed sexual offence is entitled to give evidence from a place other than the courtroom by means of closed-circuit television facilities or other technology that enables communication between that place and the courtroom. The court may order that such means not be used: s 294B(5), but only if the court is satisfied that there are special reasons in the interests of justice for the complainant not to give evidence by such means: s 294B(6).
	
	
	The Evidence (Audio and Audio Visual Links) Act, s 5B(1) provides that a New South Wales court may:
	


“… direct that a person … give evidence … by … audio visual link from any place within or outside New South Wales, including a place outside Australia, other than the courtroom or other place at which the court is sitting.”


	
	There is merit in the Crown’s submission that her Honour’s ‘order’ made under s 5B(1) that the evidence could be given by AVL is not an “interlocutory judgment or order” within the meaning of s 5F(3). There is no definition of “judgment” or “order” in the Act. However, in R v Steffan (1993) 30 NSWLR 633, at 636, this Court stated that a “judgment” is “the decision of a court which determines the proceedings (or an identifiable or separate part of them) and which is entered in the records of the court”. An “order” is “a command by a court that something be done (or not done)”.
	
	
	In Steffan, the Court expressed doubt as to whether a ruling on the admissibility of evidence was a judgment or order within the Criminal Appeal Act, s 5F. In Cheikho v R (2008) 75 NSWLR 323; [2008] NSWCCA 191, Spigelman CJ, with whom Barr and Fullerton JJ agreed, stated the matter more emphatically, at [22], referring to Steffan as part of a line of well-established authority that a ruling on the admissibility of evidence was not a judgment or order within s 5F.
	
	
	In R v Bozatsis and Spanakakis (1997) 97 A Crim R 296 at 303, Gleeson CJ, with whom Meagher JA and Bruce J agreed, explained:
	


“One of the reasons given for denying to a ruling on evidence, in the ordinary case, the quality of a judgment or order is that it can be changed during the course of the proceedings. It lacks finality. It does not require a decision of an appellate court to reverse it; at least in theory the judge can be persuaded to alter it.”


	
	In AF v R [2015] NSWCCA 35, the primary judge had declared that the complainant was a “vulnerable person” within the meaning of s 306M of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) and ruled that the complainant’s evidence be given by means of the playing of a recording of her police interview. Justice Hulme, with whom Hoeben CJ at CL and Harrison J agreed, said at [32] that:
	


“The ruling … is not concerned with the admissibility of evidence but with the manner in which evidence may be given. However, it has very much the same character as a procedural matter that does not finally dispose of any discrete part of the proceedings. It was not a judgment or order in the sense identified in R v Steffan (1993) 30 NSWLR 633 at 636 … It may be contrasted with the decision in [R v RAG [2006] NSWCCA 343] that a complainant was not competent to give unsworn evidence. The effect of that decision was that the complainant could not give evidence at all; it was a decision which had the effect that something not be done.”


	
	The same may be said of the court permitting or authorising particular technology for taking evidence via AVL, which is the subject of the orders sought by the applicant in his application for leave to appeal. Indeed, the position in this regard is even more so. As the Court stated in Steffan, an “order” is a command that something be done or not done. However, an order is not merely a command that something be done or not done. The very essence of a court order is that it is a command to someone that a thing be done or not done and is enforceable by the Court should there be non-compliance, including by way of contempt.
	
	
	These observations lead directly to the further problem in the manner in which the applicant has framed his application for leave to appeal. One of the principle complaints relates to the proposed use of Jabber technology. The terms of her Honour’s orders are set out above at [32]. Those ‘orders’, as her Honour called them, were that the two witnesses could give evidence from a remote location via AVL. Her Honour did not make any order in respect of the use of the Jabber technology, although it is clear that her Honour considered that the use of Jabber technology would be appropriate and that she would permit it to be used for the purpose of taking evidence via AVL, as she had ordered. However, a court’s acceptance that particular technology such as Jabber would be an appropriate and permissible means by which evidence may be given is a far cry from “a command that something be done or not done” and enforceable by the court should there be non-compliance.
	
	
	The view we have expressed is supported, if not confirmed, by the language of s 5B of the Evidence (Audio and Audio Visual Links) Act. The section provides that the court “may … direct that a person … give evidence … by … audio visual link”. This is to be contrasted with, for example, the language of s 15(a), which provides that a recognised Court “may, by order … direct that the proceeding, or a part of the proceeding, be conducted in private”. Section 16 provides that an order made under s 15 “must be complied with” and “may be enforced”. There is no such enforcement provision which relates to a direction made under s 5B.
	
	
	It is also likely that the use of the language of “direct” in s 5B reflects an understanding by the legislature of the fundamental proposition that the control of court processes is in the hands of the court as constituted by the judge allocated to hear the matter.
	
	
	For the same reasons, even if the applicant’s application for leave to appeal should or could be treated as relating to the ‘orders’ that the witnesses’ evidence could be given by AVL, the Court is of the opinion that such orders do not fall within s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act.
	
	
	Given that her Honour ordered, or, more correctly, directed the use of AVL pursuant to s 5B of the Evidence (Audio and Audio Visual Links) Act, it is not necessary to consider whether her Honour erred in the interpretation of s 294B of the Criminal Procedure Act, nor is it clear as to what was intended by that argument. Presumably it was directed to the extra-territoriality of the provision. However, it is not irrelevant to observe that a complainant giving evidence in proceedings to which s 294B applies has an entitlement to give evidence from a place other than a courtroom. If exercised, that entitlement requires that some form of AVL be used. It would be unusual if the means by which a statutory entitlement was implemented, in this case, pursuant to s 5B of the Evidence (Audio and Audio Visual Links) Act, could then be the subject of an interlocutory appeal process.
	
	
	Given that the better view is that neither a direction or ‘order’ made under s 5B of the Evidence (Audio and Audio Visual Links) Act nor a permission or direction that Jabber technology be used is an interlocutory order or judgment within s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act, the prospects of leave to appeal being granted and orders made in terms of proposed orders 2 and 3 of the application for leave to appeal are slight in the extreme.
	
	
	That being so, it is difficult to see that a temporary stay ought to be granted “to prevent an injustice” and “to avoid unfairness” on the basis of the use of such technology, unless some inherent unfairness is identified. As we understand the applicant’s case, there was such unfairness, having regard to the various complaints he made that should have led to his adjournment application being granted. As indicated, a significant aspect of that application focussed upon the proposed use of Jabber, including that the witnesses would give evidence from home without an ‘official’ person being in attendance such that the court could not ensure that it had control of its own processes.
	
	
	It was at the forefront of the applicant’s submission that Jabber technology was not endorsed by the Supreme Court. However, that argument can be put aside entirely. The technical difficulties with the use of Jabber in the Supreme Court building do not apply in the District Court located in the Downing Centre. As her Honour commented, the technology has been successfully used by the District Court.
	
	
	The applicant made other complaints which appeared to be directed to the unsuitability of the use of AVL at all. These included the fact that it was proposed that the interpreter was to be located in the court room and that this case would significantly turn on the credit of the complainant and the complaint witness. It is not apparent that any complaint was made in respect of the interpreter to the trial judge, but in any event, it is not apparent or obvious as to why that should have been relevant to an adjournment application.
	
	
	The point made in relation to assessing the credibility of the witnesses must also be rejected. The use of AVL for the purposes of taking evidence is well-established and there is a substantial body of authority on the exercise of the court’s discretion to permit its use for that purpose. As the cases make clear, subject to the requirements of the legislation, the decision to permit evidence to be given by AVL is a matter for the primary judge’s discretion in the circumstances of a particular case: see Kirby v Centro Properties Limited [2012] FCA 60; 288 ALR 601 at [11] per Gordon J; ASIC v Rich [2004] NSWSC 467; 49 ACSR 578 at [16] per Austin J.
	
	
	While it has sometimes been acknowledged that the question whether the credibility of the witness is in issue might be relevant to the decision to use AVL: see Kirby v Centro Properties Limited at [10]; ASIC v Rich at [27]-[28] and the cases cited therein; R v Qaumi and Ors (No 9) [2016] NSWSC 171 at [9] per Hamill J and Hughes v Whittens Group Pty Ltd [2017] NSWSC 329 at [21] per Button J, there are numerous decisions where it has been held that the demeanour of a witness could be adequately assessed by AVL: see ASIC v Rich at [24]-[26]; R v Wilkie, R v Burroughs, R v Mainprize (2005) 193 FLR 291; [2005] NSWSC 794 at [31]-[32] per Howie J; R v Lodhi [2006] NSWSC 587; (2006) 163 A Crim R 488 at [65] per Whealy J and the cases cited therein.
	
	
	It is apparent that, notwithstanding that credibility is in issue and the testimony of the complainant and the complainant witness is of central importance to the case and is expected to be of substantial duration, her Honour was satisfied that the jury could adequately assess the witnesses’ evidence given by AVL. It is perhaps worth noting that there was nothing in her Honour’s rulings or her reasons to indicate that her Honour would not manage the trial in such a way so as to ensure that the applicant would have a fair trial. 
	
	
	Other complaints related to anticipated cross-examination of the complainant on documents, which were, presumably, the text messages, as well as on certain video footage. However, her Honour was satisfied from her enquiries that this could be accommodated on the Jabber technology.
	
	
	Another significant matter, on the applicant’s submission, was the unavailability of downloads from the complainant’s phone and camera or of the phone of the complaint witness, despite numerous requests to the police that it be obtained. In this regard, although a small number of downloads had been produced, the applicant’s concern was the phone and camera should have been available or at the least enquiries as to their availability should have been made. However, her Honour dealt with the question of whether photos had been taken on the applicant’s phone or on the complainant’s phone. She observed that it was not apparent from the complainant’s statement that the photos were on her phone and that the suggestion that the photos were on the complainant’s phone had only been raised on the first morning of the trial. To the extent that the applicant contended that her Honour made no mention of the complainant’s camera, that must be considered to be a minor oversight, and not an omission of such a nature to amount to House v The King error. It is apparent from her Honour’s judgment that she was well apprised of the nature and extent of the applicant’s complaints.
	
	
	Other matters of complaint related to the late service of evidence. This was directed in particular to the evidence of Dr Tran, who was only available on the afternoon of 22 September and then would not be available for two weeks, by which time, presumably, the trial would have ended. However, as explained, the evidence of Dr Tran went to early complaint and continuity of exhibits. It was not evidence of a kind in respect of which an accused might wish to obtain evidence in response. The applicant’s complaint about the late service of a statement of a witness, YR, to whom he was said to have made an admission was also dealt with by her Honour as being a matter for cross-examination. The complaint about the Cellebrite downloads from the applicant’s phone had also become academic, as they were provided on the afternoon of 20 September, although it should be observed that this did appear to be exceptionally late.
	
	
	The remaining and larger question was whether there could be a fair trial in circumstances where there evidence would be given without the presence of a court officer or other independent person to ensure that the court processes would not be compromised in any way. In this regard, the applicant referred to the “Criminal Trial Courts Bench Book: Remote Witness Facilities Operational Guidelines”. The guidelines set out the procedures recommended for taking evidence remotely. None refer to the presence of a court officer.
	
	
	However, in the notes to the guideline, there is reference, in note 4, to court staff having set up the facilities in readiness for the hearing, and that when the court is ready to take the evidence for the witness, the court officer in the remote witness room should select the appropriate court on the control panel on the side of the remote witness cabinet. There is a further reference in note 6 to the court officer being present at all times in the remote witness room “so they will be aware at all times of what is happening in the remote witness room and can report to the court at any time as necessary”.
	
	
	This note would appear to be mainly directed to dealing with technical issues and potentially with issues relating to witness fatigue. However, they are guidelines only, and in circumstances where it is both the responsibility of and solely within the fiat of the trial judge to control the processes and procedures in the court so as to ensure there is a fair trial, there was no error in her Honour’s acceptance that the taking of the evidence via AVL could be conducted using the Jabber program.
	
	
	In the Court’s opinion, her Honour did not err in the exercise of her discretion in refusing the adjournment application and the applicant has not made out any other case for the grant of a temporary stay.

		20 October 2017",2017-10-19 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
6224195,R v LN; R v AW (No. 11) [2017] NSWSC 1430,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: This judgment contains my reasons with respect to applications made by counsel for each Accused for redirections at the conclusion of my summing-up, in particular where the application was refused (SU223). It also recounts questions from the jury during deliberations and the course taken by the Court in that respect.
	
	
	The Accused, LN and AW, stood trial for the murder of a three-year old child, Joseph or Joey, who was the son of LN and the stepson of AW. The way in which the Crown put its case against each Accused was summarised in R v LN; R v AW (No. 1) [2017] NSWSC 119 at [5]-[55] and in R v LN; R v AW (No. 9) [2017] NSWSC 376.
	


Application by LN for a Further Direction Concerning Admissions


	
	Mr Wilson SC, counsel for LN, sought a further direction with respect to admissions said to have been made by his client (SU186-187, 200-201).
	
	
	I directed the jury in the summing-up concerning the issue of admissions or confessions (SU30-34). The jury was directed that, before a statement could be taken into account as an admission or confession by one of the Accused persons, the jury must be satisfied, firstly, that the particular Accused person made the statement; secondly, that what he or she said was true; and thirdly, that what the particular Accused said implicated that person in some respect in the commission of the crime for which that Accused was standing trial (SU31).
	
	
	Further directions to the jury indicated that the real issues in this trial with respect to LN concerned the second and third issues, namely whether what was said to be an admission was true and whether it implicated her in some respect in the commission of the crime for which she was standing trial (SU32). Some examples were provided to the jury of what the Crown said were admissions by LN in this case (SU32-33).
	
	
	Apart from these directions, I reminded the jury from time to time of submissions made by the Crown and the defence with respect to what the Crown said were admissions made by LN (see, for example, SU59, 131-133, 148, 165-166).
	
	
	At the conclusion of the summing-up, Mr Wilson SC asked the Court to give a further direction with respect to admissions concerning the issue of probative value and the weight which the jury should give to an admission. In this regard, reliance was placed upon Burns v The Queen (1975) 132 CLR 258; [1975] HCA 21 at 261 and EM v The Queen (2007) 232 CLR 67; [2007] HCA 46 at 98-99 [86].
	
	
	I had, of course, given the jury a general direction that issues of weight and reliability of evidence were matters for their consideration (SU12-13).
	
	
	I was not satisfied that any further direction ought be given on this topic in this case. I did not consider that anything said in Burns v The Queen or EM v The Queen required such a direction. I took the view that the second and third steps in the directions given to the jury, namely whether the statement said to have been made by LN was true and implicated her in the crime of murder, were sufficient in the circumstances of this case.
	
	
	The statements relied upon by the Crown as admissions included statements by LN made at different times that she had thoughts of killing Joseph and hated him with some explanation as to why she had those thoughts. The Crown relied, as well, upon recorded conversations between LN and AW which were said to contain admissions made by LN to AW.
	
	
	If the jury was satisfied that an alleged admission was true and implicated LN in the murder of Joseph, there was no real work for a further direction which required the jury to assess what weight ought be given to that evidence in the circumstances of the case. To the extent that submissions made on behalf of LN at trial included an argument that what she said was not her true intention or that such an intention did not attach to the particular act or acts upon which the Crown relied, then those submissions were to be considered principally under the second and third headings relating to the truth of the alleged admissions and whether they implicated LN in the murder of Joseph.
	
	
	Whilst noting that the trial Judge in EM v The Queen did give a direction concerning weight (EM v The Queen at 98-99 [86]), I did not consider that a direction along those lines was required at law or was otherwise required in the circumstances of this trial.
	
	
	Accordingly, I declined to give this further direction to the jury.
	


Application by LN for a Further Direction Concerning Onus of Proof in the Circumstances of the Trial


	
	Senior Counsel for LN sought that I give a more elaborate direction concerning onus of proof in the circumstances of this trial (SU187-188). I had already given a number of directions in this area (SU3-4, 15-16, 24-27, 175-178).
	
	
	Having considered the matter, I foreshadowed the further direction which I proposed to give the jury and Mr Wilson SC noted that he did not wish to say anything further with respect to that formulation (SU201). I gave that further direction to the jury in the following terms (SU213).
	


“Let me say something to you which adds to what I said to you towards the end of the summing-up about how to approach the application of the onus of proof in a criminal trial where there is circumstantial evidence involved.

As I said to you early in the summing-up, the onus of proof lies on the Crown at all times in the trial. The onus never shifts from the Crown to prove its case on each element beyond reasonable doubt. If an accused person makes an explanation of the cause of death which might be a reasonable possibility, the Crown has to exclude it. There is no onus on the accused, on either accused, to prove anything in a criminal trial, including any possible explanation raised by them in evidence, such as, in this case, that Joey suffered his fatal injuries by tripping in the park.

If that alternative explanation raised by the accused as to the cause of death in this case has not been excluded in your minds as a reasonable possibility, then the Crown has not proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. In that event, as I said to you yesterday, each of the accused would have to be found not guilty of murder and not guilty of manslaughter.”

Application by AW for a Further Direction Concerning the Separate Cases Involving LN and AW


	
	Ms Moen sought a further direction concerning the separate cases involving LN and AW (SU189-191, 202-203). Ms Moen set out in writing the further direction which she sought in this regard (MFI60, page 1).
	
	
	I declined to give the direction as sought by Ms Moen. I indicated the further direction which I proposed to give to the jury on this aspect and heard further submissions from Ms Moen in that regard (SU202-203).
	
	
	In approaching this topic, it is necessary to keep in mind the written directions which I gave to the jury concerning AW: R v LN; R v AW (No. 9) (the written directions are annexed to that judgment). The jury were directed as follows in this respect:
	


“9.   Before you can find AW guilty of murder, the Crown must prove the following matters beyond reasonable doubt:

(a)   there was in existence a joint criminal enterprise (an agreement) between LN and AW which had as its object the commission of assaults upon [Joseph] by the parties to the agreement;

(b)   AW was party to that agreement;

(c)   AW participated in the joint criminal enterprise;

(d)   LN, as a party to the joint criminal enterprise, inflicted harm to [Joseph]:

(i)   by a deliberate act;

(ii)   with the intention (at least) to cause grievous bodily harm;

(iii)   and that this act caused, or substantially contributed to, the death of [Joseph].

(e)   AW contemplated the possible intentional infliction of (at least) grievous bodily harm (really serious bodily injury) by LN upon [Joseph] during the course of the joint criminal enterprise and that, with that awareness, he continued to participate in the agreed criminal enterprise.”


	
	The further direction which I gave to the jury (SU212) was as follows:
	


“So there are a number of issues I want to raise with you. The first relates to the fact that there are separate trials against [LN and AW] and it is an additional topic under the umbrella of that issue that I raised with you a number of times during the summing-up. So what I am about to say is in that line of country.

As I have said to you a number of times, there are separate trials on foot against [LN and AW]. The evidence relied upon by the Crown to prove the guilt of each accused differs. In deciding whether the Crown has proved its case against [AW], and I will just for the moment ask you to look at the elements document again, paragraph 9, in deciding whether the Crown has proved its case against [AW] on the elements in paragraph 9 (a), (b), (c) and (e), you must use evidence that was tendered against [AW] only. So, that is a more specific direction on that topic.”


	
	I was satisfied that this was an appropriate direction in the circumstances of this trial.
	
	
	It should be kept in mind that substantial parts of the evidence in the trial were admissible against both LN and AW. In this category was the evidence of FN (LN’s eldest son) who recounted what each of LN and AW did to Joseph in the confined space of the modest country cottage in which the three adults lived with Joseph and Mary (his half-sister) between 14 June and 3 August 2014. This was evidence of assaults upon Joseph by LN and AW, often in company, together with comments made by LN and AW which reflected the thought processes of each of them at relevant times. The evidence of FN was largely uncontested by counsel for LN and AW at the trial. Other evidence admissible against both Accused included that of Senior Constable Nocente concerning a conversation between LN and AW overheard by him in the Centrelink office at Bathurst on 26 August 2014.
	
	
	For the purpose of considering paragraph 9(d) of the written directions, which related solely to LN’s guilt of murder, the jury could have regard to that part of the evidence upon which the Crown relied against LN, much of which was also admissible against AW. However, for the remaining elements of AW’s alleged offence as contained in paragraphs 9(a), (b), (c) and (e), which related solely to AW, the jury was directed to have regard only to evidence that was tendered against AW. In essence, the jury would not get to paragraphs 9(a), (b), (c) or (e) on the murder count against AW unless they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of LN’s guilt of murder, being the aspect contained in paragraph 9(d).
	
	
	AW made admissions to police in recorded interviews concerning what he had done to Joseph and what he knew LN had done to the child, and why each of them had acted in that way. AW himself admitted to police that he was aware, whilst Joseph was still alive, of LN’s thoughts of killing Joseph. AW’s awareness of LN’s homicidal thoughts together with his knowledge of her physical attacks upon Joseph (as well as his own assaults upon the child) played a significant part in the Crown case in support of paragraph 9(e) (at [18] above).
	
	
	I was satisfied that the directions given to the jury were appropriate in the circumstances of the trial. They had regard to the separate bodies of evidence admissible against each Accused, together with the very substantial volume of evidence which was admissible against both of them.
	


Application by AW for Further Directions Concerning the Evidence of Katrina Holland, Alana Benson, FN and SM


	
	Ms Moen sought that I remind the jury of features of the evidence of Katrina Holland, Alana Benson, FN and SM (a young person who made observations from the nearby skate park of events in the park at the time of the alleged dog tripping incident) (SU190-194).
	
	
	With respect to these topics, I indicated the Court’s position (SU206) and gave some further directions to the jury (SU221). In adopting this approach, I was conscious that the jury had the entire transcript of evidence in the trial.
	


Application by AW for a Further Direction Concerning the Use of Evidence of Assaults and Child Abuse Committed by AW


	
	Ms Moen sought a further direction concerning this topic (SU190) which was reduced to writing (MFI60, page 2) and was the subject of further submissions (SU203-204).
	
	
	I declined to give the direction in the terms sought by Ms Moen, but I directed the jury in the manner which was foreshadowed to counsel (SU204). I said to the jury (212-213):
	


“Could I then move to another direction which relates to the way in which you can use the evidence that [AW] assaulted and abused [Joseph]. The evidence of assaults and child abuse committed against [Joseph] by [AW] can only be used by you in the ways I have explained to you a moment ago and in the summing-up as evidence in support of the elements again of paragraph 9 (a), (b), (c) and (e) of the written directions on murder. You cannot reason that, because [AW] committed assaults and child abuse against [Joseph], he is the type of person who will commit criminal activity generally. The evidence is not placed before you for that type of general reasoning. The evidence of [AW’s] assaults and child abuse of [Joseph] is before you for use in the way I have explained with respect to paragraphs 9 (a), (b), (c) and (e) of the written directions on murder.”


	
	In the circumstances of this trial, I was satisfied that this was an appropriate direction, to be taken into account with earlier directions which had been given to the jury on this topic.
	


Application by AW for a Further Direction Concerning Expert Evidence and the Onus of Proof


	
	Ms Moen sought a further direction concerning expert evidence and the onus of proof (SU197-198) which she reduced to writing (MFI60, pages 3-4).
	
	
	I declined to give the direction as sought by Ms Moen, but foreshadowed the direction which I would give in this regard and heard further submissions with respect to it (SU204-206).
	
	
	I gave a further direction as follows, which incorporated the first part of what was sought by Ms Moen in MFI60 (SU213-214):
	


“There is a further direction I want to give to you which expands a little on the issue of expert evidence and the onus of proof. I gave you some directions yesterday on the role of expert evidence in this trial and about the way it may be approached. So let me give you these additional directions.

In the present case there are some areas of conflict between some of the expert evidence relied upon by the Crown and that relied upon by each accused. One area of conflict is the question as to whether [Joseph] could have sustained his fatal injuries in a fall in the park if he was tripped and fell backwards by a rope connecting the two dogs. Where there is a relevant area of conflict between the experts, it is not a case of simply choosing between their evidence as a matter of simple preference. How you approach the resolution of that conflict will depend largely upon which party has the onus of proof in relation to the issue upon which the expert evidence relates.

The expert evidence on the question of whether a fall in the park could have caused [Joseph’s] fatal injuries is based on facts which each expert has been told or on assumptions which he or she has been asked to make. You should analyse the evidence of each of them and determine the extent to which his or her opinion depends upon the facts or assumptions being correct. There is no onus on the accused to prove the facts or assumptions upon which the opinions of Dr Donald and Dr Duflou may be based. That flows from the onus of proof in a criminal trial. If those opinions are based upon facts which you believe might have occurred as a reasonable possibility, or those assumptions might be valid as a reasonable possibility, then it is a matter for you to consider whether the opinion that is based upon those facts or assumptions is correct.”


	
	I was satisfied that this further direction, taken with earlier directions, was sufficient in the circumstances of this trial.
	


Application by AW for the Jury to be Reminded in Greater Detail of the Medical Evidence with Respect to Retinal Damage and Associated Issues


	
	Ms Moen requested the Court to remind the jury of the evidence of a number of medical witnesses concerning Joseph’s retinal damage, together with evidence concerning other injuries to Joseph’s body (SU194-196).
	
	
	I indicated that I would remind the jury of the evidence of a number of the medical witnesses concerning these topics (SU206-211). I reminded the jury of this evidence (SU215-221) in a manner which did not give rise to any further application from counsel for either Accused.
	
	
	In reminding the jury of parts of the medical evidence, I was again conscious of the fact that the jury had the entire transcript of evidence given at the trial.
	


Further Directions to the Jury in Response to Jury Questions


	
	Whilst the jury was deliberating, a note was received (MFI63; SU240) which posed the following question:
	


“Your Honour, we are having trouble defining the difference between ‘assault’, ‘grievous bodily harm’ in both manslaughter and murder. Do we have to prove that [AW] knew [LN] was going to murder [Joseph], not just cause a serious injury?”


	
	Having heard counsel with respect to this question (SU240-242), I gave the jury further directions on these topics (SU243-246), which accorded broadly with the submissions of counsel.
	
	
	Thereafter a further note was received from the jury (MFI64; SU246) which stated:
	


“Your Honour, we are having problems with 9(e) in written direction of murder. Please can you elaborate on the words ‘contemplated’ and ‘grievous bodily harm’. Thank you.”


	
	This question related to the written directions concerning AW set out earlier in this judgment (at [18] above).
	
	
	Whilst counsel were addressing with respect to MFI64, a further question was posed by the jury (MFI65; SU248) which stated:
	


“Your Honour, please can we have examples of grievous bodily harm and assault injury on Joey?”


	
	Counsel made submissions concerning the jury questions contained in MFI64 and MFI65 (SU246-251). Thereafter, I gave the jury further directions in response to these questions (SU252-256) which broadly accorded with the submissions of counsel.
	
	
	Having continued their deliberations on Thursday, 13 April 2017, the jury returned after Easter to consider their verdicts which were, in due course, delivered on Tuesday, 18 April 2017, when the jury returned verdicts of guilty of murder with respect to each Accused.
	


Conclusion


	
	This judgment sets out my short reasons for rulings made with respect to applications by counsel for each Accused at the conclusion of the summing-up and further directions which were given as a consequence of those applications and in response to jury questions.

		20 October 2017",2017-10-19 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
6224197,R v Fesus (No. 7) [2017] NSWSC 1422,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: The Accused, Steven Frank Fesus, was charged by indictment with the murder of his wife, Jodie Melissa Fesus (hereinafter referred to as “Jodie”), at Mt Warrigal on 11 August 1997.
	
	
	It was the Crown case that the Accused killed his wife by strangling or choking her in their house at Mt Warrigal and then transported her body to Seven Mile Beach where he buried her in a shallow grave. The Accused denied that he was involved at all in the disappearance or death of his wife.
	
	
	In advance of closing addresses, I heard submissions as to whether manslaughter ought be left to the jury by way of provocation or unlawful and dangerous act.
	
	
	Mr Chapple SC, for the Accused, did not seek that either form of manslaughter should be left to the jury in this case (T1431, 1447).
	
	
	I was satisfied that manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act should be left to the jury (T1459).
	
	
	I determined that provocation manslaughter should not be left to the jury in the circumstances of this case and indicated that I would publish my reasons for that ruling at a later time (T1442).
	
	
	What follows constitutes my reasons for these rulings.
	


Provocation Manslaughter


	
	I note that provocation manslaughter was left to the jury at a trial of the Accused in 2015 presided over by Wilson J. The jury could not agree upon a verdict at that trial and was discharged. Both the Crown and then counsel for the Accused agreed that provocation should be left to the jury at that trial. No ruling was required from Wilson J on that issue.
	
	
	As the alleged murder in this case occurred before the amendment of s.23 Crimes Act 1900 in June 2014 which replaced provocation with extreme provocation, this ruling applies the provision as it stood in August 1997. At that time, s.23 provided as follows:
	


“23    Trial for murder - provocation

(1)    Where, on the trial of a person for murder, it appears that the act or omission causing death was an act done or omitted under provocation and, but for this subsection and the provocation, the jury would have found the accused guilty of murder, the jury shall acquit the accused of murder and find the accused guilty of manslaughter.

(2)    For the purposes of subsection (1), an act or omission causing death is an act done or omitted under provocation where:

(a)    the act or omission is the result of a loss of self-control on the part of the accused that was induced by any conduct of the deceased (including grossly insulting words or gestures) towards or affecting the accused, and

(b)    that conduct of the deceased was such as could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost self-control as to have formed an intent to kill, or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon, the deceased,

whether that conduct of the deceased occurred immediately before the act or omission causing death or at any previous time.

(3)    For the purpose of determining whether an act or omission causing death was an act done or omitted under provocation as provided by subsection (2), there is no rule of law that provocation is negatived if:

(a)    there was not a reasonable proportion between the act or omission causing death and the conduct of the deceased that induced the act or omission,

(b)    the act or omission causing death was not an act done or omitted suddenly, or

(c)    the act or omission causing death was an act done or omitted with any intent to take life or inflict grievous bodily harm.

(4)    Where, on the trial of a person for murder, there is any evidence that the act causing death was an act done or omitted under provocation as provided by subsection (2), the onus is on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the act or omission causing death was not an act done or omitted under provocation.

(5)   This section does not exclude or limit any defence to a charge of murder.”


	
	It has been said that, in determining whether the partial defence of provocation should be left to the jury, the Accused bears an evidentiary onus to point to evidence from which it could be inferred that there is at least a reasonable possibility that the homicidal act of the Accused was provoked in accordance with s.23: R v Youssef (1990) 50 A Crim R 1 at 3. In this case, the Accused did not seek to have provocation left to the jury. In accordance with authority, the Court was required nevertheless to consider the evidence and decide if there was a proper foundation for provocation to be left to the jury.
	
	
	In Lindsay v The Queen (2015) 255 CLR 272; [2015] HCA 16, French CJ, Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ said at 279 [16] (footnotes omitted):
	


“Where provocation is raised by the evidence, the determination of whether it has been negatived is for the jury. Whether the subjective limb is negatived is a question of fact. Whether the objective limb is satisfied is a question of opinion or, to adopt Glanville Williams' classification, it is a question of ‘evaluative fact’. The threshold question of law is whether there is material in the evidence which sufficiently raises the issue to leave the partial defence for the jury's consideration. The determination of the threshold question requires the trial judge (and the appellate court) to consider the sufficiency of the evidence to allow that an ordinary person provoked to the degree the accused was provoked might form the intention to kill or to do grievous bodily harm and act upon that intention, as the accused did, so as to give effect to it. The respective roles of judge and jury in the latter determination is the issue raised by the first ground of the appeal.”


	
	I accepted that caution must be exercised before declining to leave provocation to the jury: Lindsay v The Queen at 284 [27].
	
	
	It remained a matter for the Court as to whether the partial defence of provocation should be left to the jury even if, as here, Senior Counsel for the Accused expressly declined to make such an application. For the purpose of the Court’s ruling, the Crown assisted the Court by pointing to areas of evidence which needed to be considered on the question whether this partial defence ought be left (T1431-1439).
	
	
	The trial was conducted for the Accused upon the basis that he had no involvement in the disappearance and death of Jodie. The Crown alleged that the Accused made certain admissions to an undercover police officer in the course of a covert operation in July 2013 to the effect that he strangled or choked Jodie following an argument and thereafter buried her body (see annexure to R v Fesus (No. 8) [2017] NSWSC 1423). In addition, the Crown relied upon a multi-faceted circumstantial case in support of its claim that the unavoidable conclusion was that it was the Accused who murdered Jodie. The Accused did not give evidence at the trial.
	
	
	It was the Crown case that the Accused (then 26 years old) murdered Jodie (then aged 18 years) by choking or strangulation at their Mt Warrigal home on the evening of 11 August 1997, and then transported her body to an area near a camping site at Seven Mile Beach where he buried the body in a shallow sandy grave. The body of Jodie was located on 14 September 1997. The Accused and Jodie had married in May 1997. There were two children in the family – a daughter born in July 1995 (of whom the Accused was not the father) and a son born to their relationship in June 1996. The evidence confirmed that the Accused was the father of this child.
	
	
	The evidence which fell for consideration on the issue of provocation may be summarised as follows. For the purpose of s.23 Crimes Act 1900, the focus is upon any conduct or words of Jodie towards or affecting the Accused and any evidence of the Accused losing self-control as a result of such conduct or words.
	
	
	Firstly, the evidence of Jason Nowicki and his wife, Leanne Nowicki, that the Accused, Jodie and their children attended the Nowicki household for dinner on the evening of 11 August 1997. Both Jason and Leanne Nowicki gave evidence that, in the course of the evening, an argument occurred between the Accused and Jodie as to which of them was to change the nappy of their infant son. Jason Nowicki gave evidence that, during the course of this argument, Jodie said words to the effect that the child “was his son too and he should be changing him as well” (T92). The Accused was observed rolling his eyes in the course of this incident with Jodie then hitting the Accused hard to the chest once. The Accused was seen to become quiet for a period, but did not otherwise respond. Thereafter, things settled down and some ice cream was purchased and was eaten by those in attendance. Leanne Nowicki testified that, while the two men were absent from the house to purchase ice cream, Jodie told her of problems she was having with the Accused and that she was thinking of leaving him and taking the children with her (T102). Leanne Nowicki said that Jodie had spoken to her before that evening about her concerns with the Accused. There was other evidence to a similar effect, including that of Jodie’s stepmother, Debra Smith, that Jodie told her in the days before 11 August 1997 that she had “had enough” and was thinking of leaving the Accused (T582, 606).
	
	
	Secondly, in the course of a record of interview with police on 26 August 1997 (after Jodie had disappeared, but before her body was found on 14 September 1997), the Accused said that, during the course of the argument at the Nowicki residence on the evening of 11 August 1997, Jodie had said to him words to the effect, “He’s not your fucking child” referring to their infant son (Exhibit J, pages 18-22, Q/A72-73). It is noteworthy that Jason and Leanne Nowicki did not give evidence of such words being spoken in their presence on the evening of 11 August 1997, nor was it suggested to either of them in cross-examination that this had happened. Indeed, Jason Nowicki gave evidence to the contrary effect – that Jodie commented that the child “was his son too” (see [17] above).
	
	
	Thirdly, in the course of a further record of interview with police on 28-29 December 2000, the Accused was reminded of what he had said to police on this topic in Exhibit J (see [18] above). Although he said there was an argument when he and Jodie were at the Nowicki residence, he said that he could not remember if Jodie had said words to the effect, “He’s not your fucking child” (Exhibit BF, page 272, Q/A2086ff).
	
	
	The Accused told police in that interview that there had been no argument when he and Jodie had returned home from the Nowicki’s residence and that everything was “just back to normal” (Exhibit BF, page 199, Q/A1459ff). When asked about his relationship with Jodie, the Accused said, “You always have your ups and downs” (Exhibit BF, page 256, Q/A1936).
	
	
	Fourthly, in the course of the recorded conversation on 8 July 2013 with the undercover officer (which formed part of a covert operation), the Accused said that he had “strangulated” or “choked” Jodie in the lounge room of their home on the evening of 11 August 1997 and then conveyed her body to Seven Mile Beach where he buried her. The Accused said that before he killed her, “we got into a heated argument” (Exhibit BV, page 32). The Accused did not say what the argument was about. He said that the argument was not over either of their children (Exhibit BV, pages 33, 37, 43-44). The Accused did not deny having this conversation with the undercover officer (which was video and audio recorded). Rather, the Accused told police in a record of interview on 8 July 2013 (Exhibits BW, BX) that he lied when he said that he had killed Jodie and buried her body (see annexure to R v Fesus (No. 8)).
	
	
	During the conversation on 8 July 2013, the following was said (Exhibit BV, page 76):
	


Undercover officer:   “What was she, what was said that ticked you off,…?’.

Accused:   “I don’t know. It’s just, I think it was just a lot of things. It’s just like, I slave my arse off working day and night, working at home doing everything else …”.


	
	In this context, the Accused said that Jodie had “been lazy” (Exhibit BV, page 76).
	
	
	When asked by the undercover officer whether any question that the Accused was the father of their infant son was “playing on your mind that night”, the Accused responded emphatically in the negative (Exhibit BV, page 77).
	
	
	When asked “What was it that made you do it to her?”, the Accused responded, “I don’t know. It was just a lot of things just bottled up just sick and tired of doing everything” (Exhibit BV, page 78.4).
	
	
	A little later, the Accused said, “… she did say something once. She was going to leave me and take the kids away from me that I’d never see them again. Maybe that might have been a tick off, like, you can’t take my family off me” (Exhibit BV, page 78).
	
	
	Soon after, the undercover officer said, “So was, it seems to me what ticked you off and correct me if I’m wrong mate, she’s going to take your kids?” to which the Accused responded “They mean a lot” (Exhibit BV, page 79).
	


Consideration of Evidence


	
	I keep in mind the two elements of the partial defence of provocation as contained in s.23(2) (see [9] above). Firstly, the act of the Accused causing death must be the result of a loss of self-control on his part that was induced by any conduct of the deceased (including grossly insulting words or gestures) towards or affecting the Accused: s.23(2)(a). It is necessary to consider what the evidence revealed concerning alleged conduct or words of Jodie for the purpose of determining whether there is a foundation for provocation to be left to the jury.
	
	
	Secondly, the conduct of Jodie must be such as could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the Accused to have so far lost self-control as to form an intent to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon her, whether the conduct of the deceased occurred immediately before the act causing death or at any previous time: s.23(2)(b).
	
	
	As at 11 August 1997, the Accused was almost 27 years old. Jodie had turned 18 years old in April 1997.
	
	
	The evidence of Jason and Leanne Nowicki referred to an argument between the Accused and Jodie earlier in the evening of 11 August 1997 about changing a nappy, with Jodie striking a single blow to the Accused in the course of that incident. The Accused’s record of interview with police on 26 August 1997 included an assertion that, whilst at the Nowicki residence, Jodie had told him that their infant son was not his child. There was no support in the evidence of Jason and Leanne Nowicki at the trial that words to this effect were spoken in their house. Indeed, the evidence of Jason Nowicki seemed to be to the contrary. Further, when asked about the same event by police in his December 2000 record of interview, the Accused said he could not remember such words being spoken.
	
	
	In the course of the recorded conversation with the undercover officer on 8 July 2013, the Accused said that he had strangled or choked Jodie following an argument about an undisclosed topic. He stated specifically that the argument was not about either of the children and that any earlier discussion between Jodie and himself concerning the paternity of their infant son was not playing on his mind at the time of the killing.
	
	
	The essence of what the Accused said to the undercover officer was that he felt frustrated and upset by the fact that he had to undertake domestic tasks concerning the children because Jodie was “lazy”. He agreed that he felt “bottled up” about matters of this type. The Accused stated that Jodie was going to take the children and leave him, and that this played on his mind as well at the time he killed Jodie.
	
	
	The evidence of Leanne Nowicki and Debra Smith was that Jodie was telling each of them that she was unhappy in the relationship and was thinking of leaving the Accused and taking the children with her. It was the Crown case that Jodie said this to the Accused on the evening of 11 August 1997 (as the Accused explained to the undercover officer) and that it was then that he killed his wife.
	
	
	The threshold for leaving provocation to the jury is relatively low as the reference to Lindsay v The Queen (at [11] above) makes clear. However, there must be a foundation concerning both the subjective and objective features as contained in s.23(2)(a) and (b) of the Act.
	
	
	The argument at the Nowicki house about changing the baby’s nappy does not provide a foundation for provocation, even when accompanied by a blow struck by Jodie to the Accused. In any event, the evidence indicated that things settled down after that argument.
	
	
	The suggestion that Jodie had asserted that the Accused was not the father of their infant son was tenuous in the extreme. There was no support in the evidence of Jason and Leanne Nowicki that such a statement was made at their house. Indeed, the evidence of Jason Nowicki seemed to be to the contrary. The Accused asserted this in his interview with police on 26 August 1997, but did not repeat the claim when interviewed again by police in December 2000. Further, in his conversation with the undercover officer on 8 July 2013, the Accused stated specifically that thoughts about whether he was the child’s father were not playing on his mind on 11 August 1997.
	
	
	In my view, the tenuous and contradictory material on this aspect was not such as to reach even the low threshold for provocation to be left to the jury.
	
	
	Beyond that, the Accused appeared to raise generalised grievances about his workload with his young family with criticisms being made of his young wife whom he had married just three months before. Grievances or criticisms about the domestic workload of a spouse do not, in my view, provide an evidentiary foundation with respect to the first leg of provocation under s.23(2)(a) of the Act. Nor does a statement by a wife that she proposed to leave her husband and take the children with her.
	
	
	The existence of a level of frustration at a person’s domestic workload, together with upset at news that the person’s spouse proposed to leave and take the children, did not provide a foundation for provocation to be left to the jury having regard to the requirements of s.23(2)(a) Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	Even if the matters raised above were sufficient to satisfy the first leg, I was entirely unpersuaded that the conduct of Jodie of this type was capable of providing a proper foundation for the ordinary person test contained in s.23(2)(b) of the Act. In my view, the evidence failed to provide a foundation concerning the possible reaction of the hypothetical ordinary person faced with such circumstances. As in Heron v The Queen (2003) 197 ALR 81; [2003] HCA 17 at 102-103 [90]-[98], having considered evidence relevant to the ordinary person test in s.23(2)(b), I was satisfied that it was not necessary to give any directions on provocation in this case.
	
	
	Having considered the available evidence in discharge of the Court’s obligation to determine whether provocation should be left to the jury, I was satisfied that provocation should not be left to the jury in the circumstances of this case and I so ruled on 13 September 2017 (T1442).
	


Manslaughter by Unlawful and Dangerous Act


	
	Senior Counsel for the Accused made clear his instructions that manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act should not be left to the jury (T1447).
	
	
	The basis upon which this class of manslaughter arose for consideration was the conversation on 8 July 2013 between the undercover officer and the Accused. In the course of that conversation, the Accused said that he had strangled or choked Jodie and had transported her body to the area of Seven Mile Beach where he buried her. In the course of describing what had happened, the Accused said at one point, “It wasn’t a struggle or anything” and “I didn’t throw her at all. Maybe I hugged her too hard or something that’s what I think I did” (Exhibit BV, page 79).
	
	
	To find the Accused guilty of murder, it was necessary for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he intended to kill Jodie, or intended to cause her grievous bodily harm or that he acted with reckless indifference to human life in committing the act which caused her death. If the jury was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of any of these forms of the mental element for murder, then the question would arise as to whether it was open to the jury, having found the Accused not guilty of murder, to return a verdict of guilty of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act.
	
	
	I was satisfied that it was appropriate in this case to leave manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act to the jury. Having indicated to counsel that I proposed to take this course, neither the Crown nor Senior Counsel for the Accused sought to make any further submission on the issue (T1459).
	
	
	It was for these reasons that I determined to leave manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act to the jury in this trial.

		20 October 2017",2017-10-19 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
6224200,R v Fuller (No 2) [2017] NSWSC 1351,"JUDGMENT


	
	HIS HONOUR: On 14 June 2016, the Court as presently constituted, sentenced Owen Junior Fuller (“Mr Fuller”). The Court, in effect, sentenced Mr Fuller to a head sentence of 24 years’ and 6 months imprisonment, commencing 4 March 2015 including a non-parole period of 17 years’ imprisonment.
	
	
	Both the Crown and Senior Counsel for Mr Fuller have approached the Court to address an issue in the proceedings. For that purpose the sentencing hearing was re-opened and submission put by each counsel.
	
	
	Counsel each submit that the Court should correct the sentence imposed as the sentence imposed is contrary to law, in the absence of a finding of special circumstances. It is necessary to set out the history of the matter including the reasons for the error.
	


Sentence History


	
	Mr Fuller was sentenced after a plea of guilty to the offence of murder. These reasons should be read with the Remarks on Sentence (also known as the Sentencing Reasons for Judgment) R v Fuller [2016] NSWSC 815 (“the Remarks”).
	
	
	At [34]-[39] of the Remarks, the Court described the offence as particularly serious, but not the most serious that warranted an indeterminate sentence. The Court also remarked that were it not for the youth of the offender, a more severe sentence would have been warranted.
	
	
	The putative starting point was a head sentence of 32 years’ imprisonment, which, after discount for the plea of guilty of something slightly less than 25%, resulted in a head sentence of 24 years’ and 6 months imprisonment. A non-parole period of 17 years’ imprisonment was imposed.
	
	
	At [40] of the Remarks, the Court made clear that it was not finding special circumstances and no such finding was made. Further, the Court made clear in the Remarks that an extended period of parole was unnecessary.
	
	
	The reference to an extended period of parole is a reference, in sentencing proceedings or remarks on sentence, to a shorter non-parole period than would be the case, if the prescribed ratio of non-parole period to the balance of the term of the sentence were to apply.
	
	
	There can be little doubt given the comments of the Court at [40] of the Remarks that the Court intended to apply the statutorily prescribed ratio. Moreover, given the structure of the sentence and the stated starting point of 32 years’ before discount, it cannot be doubted that the head sentence intended to be imposed was 24 years’ and 6 months imprisonment.
	
	
	The provisions of s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Act”) requires the Court first to set a non-parole period: s 44(1) of the Act. The terms of s 44(2) of the Act require the Court to set a balance of term that does not exceed one-third of the non-parole period, unless the Court decides there are special circumstances. Arithmetically, one third of the non-parole amounts to one quarter of the head sentence.
	
	
	One quarter of the head sentence of 24 years’ and 6 months is 6 years’ and 1.5 months. The balance of term imposed by the Court was 7 years’ and 6 months and exceeded the maximum balance of term (6 years’ and 1.5 months). As a consequence, the sentence imposed is wrong in law and inconsistent with s 44(2) of the Act.
	
	
	The error occurred as a result of calculating (and rounding) 70% of the head sentence instead of 75%. It was, in every sense, an error of arithmetic or calculation.
	
	
	Counsel submit that the Court should correct the calculation error by fixing a non-parole period of 18 years’ and 4 months being three-quarters of 24 years’ and 6 months (after rounding). This is an agreed position, although each counsel reaches that conclusion by a different path.
	


The Submissions


	
	The Crown submits that the error is one to be corrected under the “slip rule”, by which submission the Crown refers to the inherent or implied powers of a superior court of record to correct judgments issued. I will come to that power later in these reasons. The Crown submits that s 43 of the Act does not allow correction of the error.
	
	
	Counsel for Mr Fuller submits that the error can and should be corrected under s 43 of the Act. It is appropriate to recite the manner by which counsel has reached that conclusion.
	
	
	First, counsel submits that pursuant to the terms of s 44(3) of the Act, the sentence imposed is not invalidated by reason of a failure to comply with s 44(2) of the Act. Next, the submission notes that more than a mere error of law or fact is required to engage the operation of s 43(2) of the Act.
	
	
	Relying on the judgment of the High Court in Achurch v The Queen (2014) 253 CLR 141; 236 A Crim R 427; [2014] HCA 10 at [32] and [36], it is submitted that a narrow construction of s 43 of the Act ought to be applied: Bungie, Scott v R; Bungie, Robert v R [2015] NSWCCA 9 at [36].
	
	
	Nevertheless, counsel submits that a sentence imposed contrary to s 44(2) of the Act involves more than mere error of law. Such a sentence is, while valid, impermissible. Absent a decision as to special circumstances, the sentence imposed is “contrary to law”, namely inconsistent with an express requirement of the law: Wise v R [2006] NSWCCA 264 at [14], per Rothman J (Spigelman CJ and Howie J agreeing).
	


Consideration


	
	The issue between the parties at this time is the method by which the Court corrects the sentence imposed. There is no issue as to the correction that should be effected.
	
	
	Further, counsel for Mr Fuller, understandably, reminds the Court of the effect of not correcting the sentence. The correction “will avoid the need to incur the cost, delay and expense in having to institute an appeal”.
	
	
	The Court, as a superior court of appeal, has certain limited powers to correct judgments after entry. The sentence imposed has been entered.
	
	
	The Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Jones; R v Hili (No 2) (2010) 79 NSWLR 143; [2010] NSWCCA 195, after determining that the Court of Criminal Appeal is a superior court of record, commented (Per Rothman J, McClellan CJ at CL agreeing):
	


“[29]   Reasons for judgment do not ordinarily form part of the record of the court: Craig, supra; but, for the purpose of the issue of orders in the nature of certiorari, s 69 of the Supreme Court Act now renders reasons for judgment part of the record.

[30]   At least in part, for that reason, or derived in part from the principles that give rise to that reason, significant restrictions are imposed upon the jurisdiction of a superior court to alter judgments, once entered.

[31]   As stated in Grierson v The King [1938] HCA 45; (1938) 60 CLR 431 at 436, Dixon J commented:

‘The determination of an appeal is evidently definitive, and a conviction unappealed is equally final. No considerations controlling or affecting the conclusion to be deduced from these provisions are supplied by analogous civil proceedings.’

His Honour was there referring to the effect of the Act.

[32]   Likewise in the joint judgment of Dawson and Gaudron JJ in Postiglione v R [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 300, their Honours said:

‘If a final order was made perfecting the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal on Postiglione’s first application, the assumption of jurisdiction to entertain his second application and the ensuing appeal was contrary to the decision of this Court in Grierson v The King [1938] HCA 45; (1938) 60 CLR 431. It was held in that case that the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) does not confer jurisdiction to reopen an appeal which has been heard on the merits and finally determined. A fortiori, in a case where what is involved is the hearing of a second appeal. Pantorno does not suggest otherwise. The view was expressed in Pantorno that an intermediate court of appeal can entertain an application to remedy a denial of procedural fairness whether or not its order has been perfected (Pantorno v The Queen [1989] HCA 18; (1989) 166 CLR 466 at 474 per Mason CJ and Brennan J, 484 per Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ.)’

The foregoing approach was also adopted or accepted by McHugh J (at 315) and by Gummow J (at 327) in Postiglione, supra.

[33]   Thus, there are two quite distinct periods, each of which determines the ability to alter judgments or orders. Prior to the judgment being entered, the circumstances in which a court will be persuaded to entertain further argument (and possibly further evidence) are extremely limited. In relation to such earlier period, the High Court, in Elliott & Blessington applied the civil criteria expressed by the Court in Autodesk Inc v Dyason (No. 2) [1993] HCA 6; (1993) 176 CLR 300 which said, at 303:

‘What must emerge, in order to enliven the exercise of the jurisdiction, is that the Court has apparently proceeded according to some misapprehension of the facts or the relevant law and that this misapprehension cannot be attributed solely to the neglect or default of the party seeking the rehearing. The purpose of the jurisdiction is not to provide a backdoor method by which unsuccessful litigants can seek to re-argue their cases.’

[34]   On the other hand, after judgment has been entered there are only three bases upon which a judgment or order may be reopened and amended and they are:

(a)   the ‘slip’ rule;

(b)   the power to amend the rule where the intention of the Court has not manifested in the judgment; and

(c)   the capacity to allow the opening of orders made in chambers: see Bailey v Marinoff [1971] HCA 49; (1971) 125 CLR 529; DJL, supra, CH Giles & Co v Morris (1972) 1 All ER 1960. 

[35]   In Bailey v Marinoff, supra, Barwick CJ said:

‘Once an order disposing of a proceeding has been perfected by being drawn up as the record of a court, that proceeding apart from any specific and relevant statutory provision is at an end in that court and is in its substance, in my opinion, beyond recall by that court. It would, in my opinion, not promote the due administration of the law or the promotion of justice for a court to have a power to reinstate a proceeding of which it has finally disposed.’ (Per Barwick CJ at 530.)

In the same judgment, Menzies J said:

‘This appeal is not concerned with the power of a court to alter orders in pending litigation. It is concerned with the power of a court to make an order in litigation which, without any error or lack of jurisdiction, has been regularly concluded and is no longer before the court. To recognize the problem is, I think, to solve it. However wide the inherent jurisdiction of a court may be to vary orders which have been made, it cannot, in my opinion, extend the making of orders in litigation that has been brought regularly to an end.’ (Per Menzies J, Bailey v Marinoff, supra, at 531-532.)

. . .

[37]   In DJL, supra, the High Court (Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ) said:

‘[34]    The common law courts, as superior courts of record, had “full power to rehear or review a case until judgment [was] drawn up, passed, and entered”. That statement, with citation of supporting authority, was made by Starke J in Texas Co (Australasia) Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation. Even after entry of judgment, an error arising from an accidental slip or omission might be corrected at any time by further order in the action and even without an enabling rule of court. An order also might be made in the action for the correction of the records of the court to make certain that they truly represented what the court had pronounced or had intended to pronounce. It also appears that a judgment might be set aside after entry if the parties to the judgment consented, although in deciding whether to make such an order the court would have regard to the interests of third parties. Finally, where the business of the court was so organised that some orders were made in chambers, those orders may have been open to review by motion in the action, even if they were final orders. 

[35]    The Court of Chancery had power to reopen and rehear cases which had been tried before it, even after the decree had been entered. The right of rehearing in the Court of Chancery had involved the exercise of appellate rather than original jurisdiction. Sir George Jessel MR so concluded in In re St Nazaire Co . However, that peculiar state of affairs in Chancery did not continue with respect to the exercise of equitable jurisdiction by the Supreme Court of Judicature established by the Judicature Act 1873 (UK). The structure it provided included the Court of Appeal.’ (DJL, supra, at 244, [34]-[35].)”


	
	There are other statements to similar effect. Of note is that the correction effected in Hili & Jones, supra, was to the wording of the reasons for judgment; not the terms of the judgment; nor the reasons, as distinct from the wording thereof.
	
	
	The power confirmed by s 43 of the Act is a power to re-open the sentence hearing relevantly in circumstances where the Court “has imposed a penalty that is contrary to law”: s 43(1) of the Act. The power to re-open conferred by s 43 of the Act is to allow the court, relevantly, to “impose a penalty that is in accordance with the law”.
	
	
	The terms of the Act do not allow the correction of the reasons for judgment or the remarks on sentence. Nor does the Act permit the corrections of the determination of any necessary precondition to the imposition of sentence, unless such a determination is part of the sentence imposed.
	
	
	In the present situation, a sentencing judge could not utilise the provisions of s 43 of the Act to alter the decision on the existence of special circumstances. This would be so, even if there were error of law manifest in the determination. It is unnecessary to venture into the possibility of a simple omission of such a finding, where the intention is otherwise manifest. However, such an issue may be corrected by other means, to which the Court will come.
	
	
	The subject of the examination by the Court is the sentence (or more accurately, the penalty) and it is the penalty that may be amended under the powers conferred by the provision.
	
	
	In construing any statutory instrument, the Court is required to give effect to the legislative intention as discerned from the words used; their context; the purpose of the legislation; and the achievement of harmonious goals: Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) 194 CLR 355; [1998] HCA 28 at [69] and [70]. The principles are well-known and need no further repetition: SZTAL v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2017] HCA 34 at [14].
	
	
	Counsel for Mr Fuller relies on the comment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Wise v R, supra, which is to the following effect:
	


“[14]   Further, if the original sentence by Blackmore DCJ were imposed contrary to s.44(1) or s.45(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the provisions of s.43 of that Act would be available to reopen the proceedings and re-sentence according to law: s.43(2)(a). However, Charteris DCJ did not have this power because, as previously stated, the original sentence of Blackmore DCJ purported to give a reason in accordance with the requirements of s.45(2) of the Act. While the reason given was inadequate and not one which would allow a judge not to fix a non-parole period, the sentence was not ‘contrary to law’ for the purpose of s.43. It was a sentence that suffered from error of law which required correction on appeal, but only on appeal.”


	
	The first sentence of the foregoing comment was not necessary for the determination of the Court. Nevertheless, it is, at least, persuasive: Farah Construction Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd (2007) 230 CLR 89; [2007] HCA 22.
	
	
	The common law jurisdiction of a superior court of record does not permit the correction or amendment of a judgment that has been entered merely to correct legal error (even manifest error) unless, by coincidence, the error is one able to be corrected pursuant to the principles recited at [22] above. The purpose of s 43 of the Act is principally “to correct manifest error” in the sentence, when manifested in the record: Achurch v The Queen, supra.
	
	
	The purpose described by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Achurch v R (No 2) (2013) 84 NSWLR 328; [2013] NSWCCA 117 and summarised above returns the Court to “the record”: Burrell v The Queen (2008) 238 CLR 218; [2008] HCA 34 at [21], Achurch v R (No 2), supra, at [66]. For the purposes of s 43 of the Act, the record does not extend to the reasons for judgment: cf. s 69(4) of the Supreme Court Act 1970.
	
	
	This issue was historically examined for the purpose of the issue of writs of certiorari: see Kirk v Industrial Relations Commission; Kirk Group Holdings Pty Ltd v WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (Inspector Childs) (2010) 239 CLR 531; [2010] HCA 1 at [56] – [59]. Notwithstanding the comment of the High Court in Kirk, supra, at [100], the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to correct error of law on the face of the record of an inferior court or tribunal was an inherent jurisdiction and inheres in the Court with supervisory or common law appellate jurisdiction: see Kirk, supra, at [57] and [59], citing, with approval, Sawer, “Error of Law on the Face of an Administrative Record”, (1956) 3 University of Western Australia Annual Law Review 24 at 34-35 and Darlow v Shuttleworth [1902] 1 KB 721 at 726. See also Marbury v Madison 5 U.S. 137 (1803).
	
	
	The variations in the application or inapplicability of certiorari derived not from the lack of jurisdiction in the supervisory court, but in the alteration of that which was held to form part of the record. Courts, otherwise denied a record in which to find error, would utilise, for example, the use of the term “for the foregoing reasons”, in the preamble to orders issued, as importing into the record the reasons for judgment, allowing those reasons to be utilised for the purpose of disclosing error of the requisite kind.
	
	
	That casuistry is not relevant for present purposes. Nor are the provisions of s 69(4) of the Supreme Court Act. The “record” is the content of any order or judgment (as distinct from the reasons for judgment). It is impermissible for a court to utilise s 43 of the Act to overcome a difficulty or legal error in the reasons for judgment: Burrell v The Queen, supra.
	
	
	It is then necessary to examine that which forms part of the record in the sentence hearing. The reasons are not, ordinarily, part of the record. Nor is the transcript of proceedings.
	
	
	In a superior court of record, the record consists of all judgments issued. That record may or may not have been perfected, but the record consists, at least, of all orders issued.
	
	
	An order is the Court’s adjudication on an issue before it and includes a decision to refuse to make an order. It includes a refusal to adjourn: Maxwell v Keun [1928] 1 KB 645; Haset Sali v SPC Ltd (1993) 116 ALR 625; [1993] HCA 47; Peterborough v Overseers of the Parish of Wilsthorpe (1883) 12 QBD 1.
	
	
	I dealt with this issue in Kostas & Anor v HIA Insurance Services Pty Ltd trading as Home Owners Warranty & Anor [2007] NSWSC 315 in which I said:
	


“[150]   … In that sense, a decision would include every practically operative or determinative adjudication of an issue in the proceedings: see ABT v Bond (1990) 170 CLR 321.  An order, similarly, would include a direction or conclusion on matters: Onslow v Inland Revenue Commissioners (1890) 25 QBD 465; Peterborough v Wilsthorpe (1883) 12 QBD 1; and includes interlocutory orders or decisions, respectively: Maxwell v Keun [1928] KB 645; R v Ludeke, ex parte COA (1985) 155 CLR 513 at 526; Gas and Fuel Corporation Superannuation Fund v Saunders (1994) 52 FCR 48.

[151]   In Gas and Fuel Corporation Superannuation Fund v Saunders, supra, the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia (Per Gummow and Heerey JJ, with whom Davies J agreed in a separate judgment) said:

‘... [T]he orders pronounced by his Honour . . . were orders which were (subject of course to obtaining leave) properly the subject of an appeal. They were in the nature of procedural directions and thus interlocutory, but orders nonetheless. The practical and legal effect of what his Honour did was, to use his Honour’s words, to “order a new trial by another judge of the Court”. Judges of this Court, as a matter of routine, give directions (which are a species of order) that cases be placed in a list for trial, or that a trial commence on a specified date or that a trial date already fixed be vacated. For example, an order of a judge directing that a matter be fixed for trial after rejecting a party’s contention that it was not ready could be the subject of appeal.’

[152]   This judgment was summarised by another Full Court of the Federal Court (Per Beaumont, Carr and Branson JJ in Brooks v The Upjohn Company and Others (1998) 85 FCR 469) as follows:

‘In Gas & Fuel Corporation Superannuation Fund v Saunders (1994) 52 FCR 48 at 59-64 Gummow and Heerey JJ (with whom Davies J agreed) reviewed the authorities. In that case the primary judge, after a lengthy hearing and very shortly before delivering his reserved judgment, acceded to the applicants' request to disqualify himself on the ground of perceived bias.

His Honour made orders that the proceeding no longer stand for judgment, that it be placed in the list of cases to be fixed for hearing, and that the costs of the trial (and other costs) be reserved to the judge who would thereafter try the proceedings. The Full Court of this Court held that there was jurisdiction for it to consider whether the primary judge had erred in disqualifying himself. That was because the orders pronounced by his Honour, which we have just summarised, although procedural directions, and thus interlocutory, were “orders nonetheless” (see at 64). They were orders which, subject to obtaining leave, were properly the subject of an appeal. The same can be said of the two sets of orders in this matter. In the present matter, assuming that such a vehicle is necessary to ground an application for leave to appeal, it can be found in the orders made by her Honour on 2 April 1998, which included an order fixing the trial date. Even the costs order made by her Honour on 25 February 1998 when she declined to disqualify herself would suffice.’

[153]   A decision remains so, even if interlocutory, as does an order.  In this case, the finding (to use a neutral word) was an adjudication, which in a practical sense, was operative and determinative of an issue in the proceedings...”


	
	The determination of the Court that there are or there are not special circumstances is an adjudication between the parties on a matter that is required to be determined and, as such, forms part of the record. The determination could (and possibly should) be included in the formal orders on sentencing, in the same way as a judicial officer would or may record a conviction as part of the formal orders. Even when the conviction is not formally placed in the orders, it necessarily forms part of the orders issued (except, of course, where a conviction is deliberately not recorded, in which case that decision forms part of the record).
	
	
	As such the determination by the Court of the existence of special circumstances is an order of the Court and forms part of the record. It is unnecessary to discuss whether a situation in which a court has overlooked the necessity to determine special circumstances falls into the same category, but I doubt that it would. The provisions of s 43 of the Act allow correction of the sentence; not the record. Thus, the determination of the existence of special circumstance (or otherwise) informs the existence of legal error but, even though part of the record, is incapable of being varied under those provisions.
	
	
	In the present case, the Court has determined that no special circumstances exist and that there is no need for a shorter non-parole period than would result from an application of the statutory ratio. The sentence imposed did not reflect that intention because of a miscalculation of the ratio.
	
	
	In my view, as a result of an examination of the record, and only the record, the sentence imposed is contrary to law and remediable under the provisions of s 43 of the Act. The sentence imposed was contrary to law because it was, on an examination of the record itself, without power, in the absence of a finding of special circumstances: Achurch v The Queen, supra.
	
	
	If the foregoing analysis be incorrect, it does not mean that the Court is without remedy. Because the Court has the powers of a superior court of record, it has available to it, the capacity to correct the judgment for miscalculation under the “slip rule”.
	
	
	As earlier stated, the “slip rule” is often, and above, used to summarise the powers available to correct errors, namely:
	



	
	The slip rule;
	
	
	The power to amend an order where the intention of the Court has not manifested in the judgment; and
	
	
	The capacity to allow the opening of orders made in chambers: see Bailey v Marinoff (1971) 125 CLR 529; [1971] HCA 49; DJL v Central Authority (2000) 201 CLR 226; [2000] HCA 17.
	



	
	As the Crown has correctly submitted, the error in the sentence imposed is also as a result of an error of computation and may be remedied under both (a) and (b) above. A court may arrive at a sentence that is contrary to law by a “slip”, and that, in my view, provides a superior court of record, at least, with the capacity to correct the error by following fundamentally different paths.
	
	
	A sentence that is contrary to law may be corrected by utilising the powers granted by s 43 of the Act, even though the contravention has been obtained by computational error. Conversely, an order may be corrected by a superior court of record utilising its powers under the “slip rule”, even though the slip has resulted in a sentence “contrary to law”. In rare cases, such as this, each power is available.
	
	
	One further matter needs comment. These reasons refer to the “slip rule” being available to a superior court of record. The Court, by implication or otherwise, is passing no comment on the power of other courts or tribunals. Given the circumstances in this case, such a comment would be wholly unnecessary and most undesirable: Burrell v The Queen, supra, at [13].
	
	
	It is clear that the intention of the Court was not to find special circumstances, nor to have a longer period than the statutory ratio would provide as the period during which Mr Fuller was eligible for parole.
	
	
	In those circumstances, the following applies:
	



	
	The record (including the determination on the issue of special circumstances) discloses a sentence contrary to law in that a statutory precondition for the imposition of the non-parole period has not been met;
	
	
	The calculation of the sentence ratio at 70:30 instead of 75:25 results from computational error; and
	
	
	The ratio as imposed does not reflect the obvious intention of the Court.
	



	
	As earlier stated, the parties agree as to the method by which this error should be corrected. Once more I congratulate counsel for the thoroughness and competence of their submissions.
	
	
	The Court makes the following order:
	



	
	Order (3) issued on 14 June 2016 is deleted and, in lieu thereof, the following varied sentence is imposed and order substituted:
	


“(3)   Sentence imposed of a non-parole period of 18 years’ and 4 months imprisonment commencing 4 March 2015 and concluding 3 July 2033, with a balance of term of 6 years’ and 2 months concluding 3 September 2039.”

6224208,Reilly v Reilly [2017] NSWSC 1419,"Judgment

INTRODUCTION

The Parties


	
	Francis Bede Reilly (“the deceased”) died on 22 December 2012, aged 88 years, leaving:
	



	
	a will dated 26 March 2003, a grant of probate or administration of which has yet to be made;
	
	
	a widow (the first defendant), a wife of long-standing; and
	
	
	five adult children (a son and four daughters) of the marriage between the first defendant and himself.
	



	
	The deceased’s son is the plaintiff. His daughters are, respectively, the second to fifth defendants.
	
	
	The sixth defendant is a solicitor against whom the plaintiff makes a claim for compensation (in equity and at common law) dependent, in part, on the outcome of his claims for relief against his mother and sisters referable to the deceased estate of his father.
	
	
	The estate of the deceased is not, generally, represented in the proceedings. There has been no interim grant of administration in aid of representation of the estate in the proceedings. On 26 February 2016 I did make an order, subject to further order, that the plaintiff be appointed (pursuant to the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 NSW, rule 7.10) to represent the estate for the purposes of claims for relief made by his sisters, as cross claimants, under Chapter 3 of the Succession Act 2006 NSW, for family provision relief. However, that order fell short of a general representative order.
	
	
	The absence of a grant of administration, or a general representative order, is no impediment to a final determination of all questions in dispute in these proceedings binding the estate of the deceased and all who have, or may have, an interest in the estate.
	
	
	All persons who have or may have an interest in the estate (namely, the widow and children of the deceased) are parties to the proceedings, and they will be bound by the Court’s orders.
	
	
	There is no dispute that the will of the deceased dated 26 March 2003 is his last will, subject to an application by the plaintiff for an order that it be rectified so as to express the deceased’s true testamentary intentions.
	


The farming properties and partnerships of the Reilly family


	
	The deceased and the first defendant (a nurse by profession) were farmers on land near Forbes, New South Wales.
	
	
	Throughout their marriage they farmed two adjoining properties:
	



	
	“Malaya” (324 hectares/800 acres) was held in the name of the first defendant.
	
	
	“Boronga” was held in the name of the deceased.
	



	
	There is a dispute on the pleadings as to whether “Boronga” is 485 hectares (1200 acres) or only 408 hectares (1000 acres), but nothing turns on the difference. A formal contract dated 1 July 2009 pursuant to which the first defendant purportedly effected a transfer of the property to her daughters describes it as comprising 550.10 hectares (1,359 acres 1 rood 113/4 perches). Estimates of value placed before the Court at the final hearing proceed on the basis (as do I) that the land comprises 550 hectares or thereabouts.
	
	
	The current proceedings have been conducted on the basis that the legal and beneficial title to the two properties resided in the registered proprietor in each case.
	
	
	For many years before 30 June 2009 a farming business was conducted on the properties, farmed as a single unit, by the deceased and the first defendant, under the name “The FB & ML Reilly Partnership”.
	
	
	On 1 July 2009 two partnership deeds were executed:
	



	
	One deed, signed by each of the deceased’s five children (including the plaintiff), established a partnership known as “Shadrack Partnership”.
	
	
	The other deed, signed only by the deceased’s daughters, and not at that time brought to the attention of the plaintiff, established a partnership known as “Boronga Partnership”.
	



	
	The deed relating to the Shadrack Partnership recites that the parties had agreed “to carry on as partners in the business of investment and such other activities as they may from time to time agree upon”. The terms of the deed disclose no overt connection with “Boronga” or the FB & ML Reilly Partnership.
	
	
	The deed relating to the Boronga Partnership recites that the parties had agreed “to carry on as partners in the business of farming and grazing operations and such other activities as they may from time to time agree upon”. Clause 3 of the deed identified partnership assets as including “the right of grazing and farming on the property known as ‘Boronga’ Gunningbland or any other lands acquired by the partnership or any member thereof by purchase, lease agistment agreement or otherwise and also any plant and livestock acquired by the partnership and progeny of the livestock held from time to time.”
	
	
	Assets of the FB & ML Reilly Partnership appear to have been transferred to the Shadrack Partnership on the basis that the farming business conducted on “Malaya” and “Boronga” was, from 1 July 2009, conducted by the Shadrack Partnership. Financial statements prepared for each of the years ended 30 June in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 are consistent with that having occurred. However, the value of any assets thus transferred is not clear on the evidence.
	
	
	The pleadings contain no claim for relief directed towards having the partners in the Shadrack Partnership (the children of the first defendant and the deceased) account to the FB & ML Reilly Partnership (the first defendant and the estate of the deceased) for any appropriation of assets of the old partnership by the new.
	
	
	With the exception of the deceased, all persons interested in both partnerships are parties to the present proceedings. Although the estate of the deceased is not represented otherwise than by an order appointing the plaintiff to represent the estate for the purpose of his sisters’ family provision claims, all persons interested in the estate are parties to the proceedings. The proceedings do not provide a vehicle for speculation about how the Shadrack Partnership came to enjoy assets of the FB & ML Reilly Partnership. The first defendant (the only surviving partner of that partnership) makes no complaint. All other parties, collectively, are the only members of the Shadrack Partnership and the only persons interested in the estate of the deceased.
	
	
	The parties have agreed that the Shadrack Partnership should be dissolved by an order of the Court, with an order that the partnership be wound up and an order that accounts be taken, leaving any disputes to be submitted to a commercial arbitration in accordance with the partnership deed.
	
	
	In the course of his submissions the plaintiff complains that he has not received due compensation for work done in management of the farm for the FB & ML Reilly Partnership and the Shadrack Partnership. His statement of claim makes no claim for relief bearing upon such claims, but his sisters invite the Court (with his acquiescence) to determine his claims in these proceedings.
	
	
	I am not satisfied that the plaintiff’s claims for compensation have any underlying legal entitlement to remuneration. The work he did in management of the farm was done in a family setting, without any intention, in fact, that it involve a legal entitlement to remuneration (Balfour v Balfour [1919] 2 KB 571 at 578-579; Ermogenous v Greek Orthodox Community of SA Inc. (2002) 209 CLR 95 at 105[24]-106[26]) beyond what might be reflected in accounts of the partnership for the time being conducting the farming business. Any work done by him beyond that might be material to an understanding of why the first defendant may have transferred “Malaya” to him, and why the deceased may have left “Boronga” to him, or to a determination of his sisters’ family provision claims; but it was never intended by any member of the Reilly family to give rise to a separate, legal entitlement to remuneration. In my judgement, it does not do so.
	
	
	The plaintiff conceded in cross examination that he had signed each of the financial statements, and the tax returns, prepared (with his personal participation) on behalf of the Shadrack Partnership.
	
	
	It is not necessary to consider whether the parties are able to contest the state of accounts between them as manifested in the financial statements: cf, Commonwealth Dairy Produce Equalisation Committee Limited v McCabe (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 397 at 401-402. It is sufficient to record that the plaintiff’s claims to compensation for work done in management of the farm, insofar as not reflected in partnership accounts, are rejected; there is no demonstrated basis for a re-opening of the accounts of the Shadrack Partnership as adopted by each of the partners year by year; and (as explained by Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Everett (1980) 143 CLR 440 at 446-447 and Chan v Zacharia (1984) 154 CLR 178 at 192-193 and 205) the plaintiff’s share in the partnership consists of a right, governed by the partnership deed, to a proportion of any surplus after realisation of the assets, and payment of debts and liabilities of the partnership, upon its being wound-up.
	
	
	That there may have been some informality in the establishment, and conduct of the Shadrack Partnership, is confirmed by file notes of the sixth defendant’s firm which suggest that, in causing the partnership to be established, the first defendant reserved for herself and the deceased a “right” to draw on profits of the Shadrack Partnership on the basis that those profits were derived from assets of the FB & ML Reilly Partnership.
	
	
	There is no basis in these proceedings for treating such a “right”, if it ever existed, as anything more than an informal incident of family relationships. It finds no reflection in the deed governing the Shadrack Partnership or in any claims for relief made in these proceedings.
	
	
	There is no evidence that the Boronga Partnershp has ever carried on business. In any event, the plaintiff is not a party to the partnership deed; his statement of claim makes no claim for relief in respect of it; and neither does the cross summons of his sisters.
	
	
	The focus for attention in the statement of claim is a dispute about beneficial ownership of “Boronga”, to which are joined consequential claims for compensation.
	
	
	The focus for attention in the cross summons, so far as it is controversial, is upon: first, a claim that the plaintiff deliver up possession of “Boronga” to his sisters; and secondly, claims for family provision relief made by the girls (under Chapter 3 of the Succession Act 2000 NSW) as an alternative to their claim of ownership of “Boronga”.
	
	
	It has not been suggested that the existence of the FB & ML Reilly Partnership constrained the ability of the deceased and the first defendant to dispose of the parcels of land registered in their respective names.
	


The Reilly Family


	
	The deceased (born in 1924) and the first defendant (born in 1929) were married in 1961. The first defendant is now aged 88 years.
	
	
	The children of the marriage between the deceased and the first defendant, all parties to the proceedings, comprise the following:
	



	
	the plaintiff, born in 1967, now aged 50 years.
	
	
	the second defendant, born in 1962, now aged 55 years.
	
	
	the third defendant, born in 1964, now aged 53 years.
	
	
	the fourth defendant, born in 1965, now aged 52 years.
	
	
	the fifth defendant, born in 1969, now aged 48 years.
	


Family Problems


	
	The present proceedings arise out of failures in the management of inter-generational change in a farming family, with miscarriages in succession plans involving (to use neutral expressions):
	



	
	a disconnection in arrangements which the first defendant believes to have been made between the deceased and herself before he became incapacitated;
	
	
	a lack of communication between the plaintiff and the first defendant as joint and several donees of an enduring power of attorney granted to them by the deceased, compounded by an absence of communication between the plaintiff and a solicitor retained by the first defendant (in her capacity as an attorney for the deceased) to transfer “Boronga” to her daughters after her husband lost capacity; and
	
	
	a clerical error in the will of the deceased which purported to dispose of “Boronga” without nomination of a beneficiary (despite instructions given by the deceased to the solicitor who drafted the will that the property be gifted to the plaintiff), giving rise to an application by the plaintiff for an order under section 27 of the Succession Act 2006 NSW that the will be rectified.
	



	
	From a date no later than 2008 the deceased, suffering from dementia, began a descent into mental incapacity. There is no dispute that he was mentally incapable of managing his affairs in, throughout and after 2009.
	


The Enduring Power of Attorney at Issue


	
	In preparation for such a contingency the deceased executed, in favour of the first defendant and the plaintiff jointly and severally, an enduring power of attorney (in a form prescribed for the purpose of section 163B of the Conveyancing Act 1919 NSW) dated 7 June 2000.
	
	
	The authority conferred by the instrument, paraphrasing section 163B, was an authority “to do on [behalf of the deceased] anything [the deceased] may lawfully authorise an attorney to do”.
	
	
	The instrument was not expressed to be subject to specified “conditions and limitations”; but the printed form adapted for the deceased’s execution contained a deletion of a provision which would otherwise have conferred on his attorneys authority “to execute an assurance or other document, or do any other act, whereby a benefit is conferred” on the attorneys.
	
	
	The certificate required under section 163F(2) of the Conveyancing Act 1919 for the instrument to take effect as an enduring power of attorney was given by the deceased’s solicitor, Mr PJ Buckley.
	
	
	The power of attorney was not immediately, or on the deceased’s instructions, registered in the office of the Registrar General.
	


THE FIRST DEFENDANT’S TRANSFER OF “BORONGA” TO HER DAUGHTERS


	
	It came to be registered (as Book 4570 No. 954) on 6 July 2009 when the first defendant caused a solicitor (Duncan Maccallum) in the employ of the sixth defendant (Dennis McGroder) to register it as a step (taken at a time after the deceased had lost mental capacity) towards her unilateral transfer (by a memorandum of transfer dated 1 July 2009) of “Boronga” to her daughters (the second, third, fourth and fifth defendants), as a gift, for a nominal consideration of $1.00.
	
	
	At the time of transfer, “Boronga” had a market value of not less than $815,000 or thereabouts. A formal market appraisal dated 18 May 2009 estimated its value at $815,000. A valuation report obtained for the purpose of these proceedings (which include claims for family provision relief) suggests that it may have been worth more than that estimate. That report attributes to “Boronga” as at 4 March 2015 a fair market value of $1,275,000, assuming vacant possession.
	
	
	The memorandum of transfer, which provided for the daughters to hold the property as joint tenants, was registered on 2 December 2009 as dealing No. AF155999. Subject to a caveat (dealing No. AI358646) lodged by the plaintiff against 3 of the five parcels of land comprising the property, title to “Boronga” remains in the deceased’s daughters as joint tenants.
	
	
	Why the property was transferred to the girls as joint tenants, rather than as tenants in common, appears to have been related to a desire on the part of the first defendant and her daughters to keep the property in the Reilly family. There were hints in the evidence, and a suggestion in the plaintiff’s final submissions, that the property was transferred to his sisters on a secret trust for the deceased as a means of facilitating a future claim by the deceased for pension entitlements. However, the statement of claim does not plead such a case, and I put it to one side.
	
	
	The first defendant felt justified in transferring “Boronga” to her daughters because, she says:
	



	
	she had a conversation with the deceased, in or about March/April (or possibly as late as June) 2000, at about the time the deceased appointed her (and the plaintiff) to the office of attorney, to the effect that, if she transferred “Malaya” to the plaintiff, the deceased would leave “Boronga” to their daughters in his will;
	
	
	although she did not know until after the death of the deceased (on 22 December 2012) whether he had a will and, if he did, what were its terms, considerations of fairness as between siblings dictated that her daughters get “Boronga”; and
	
	
	relying on her agreement with the deceased, she felt able (in her capacity as an enduring attorney of the deceased) to effect a transfer of “Boronga” to the daughters.
	



	
	The plaintiff does not accept that there was any agreement between his parents that might deny him a right to inherit “Boronga”.
	
	
	A hurdle to his establishment of such a right is the defective character of the will executed by the deceased on 26 March 2003.
	


THE DECEASED’S WILL AND RECTIFICATION


	
	The will, prepared and witnessed by Mr Buckley, is defective because the words of gift in clause 3 of the document purport to dispose of “Boronga” (and the deceased’s share of stock and plant on “Boronga”) without naming a beneficiary.
	
	
	Omitting formal parts, the will is in the following terms:
	


“THIS IS THE LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT of me FRANCIS BEDE REILLY of “Boronga”, Gunningbland in the State of New South Wales, Farmer.

1. I HEREBY REVOKE all Wills and Testamentary dispositions previously made by me and declare this to be my last Will and Testament.

2. I APPOINT my Wife [the first defendant] Sole Executrix and Trustee of this my Will OR in the event of predeceasing me I APPOINT my Son [the plaintiff] Executor and Trustee of this my Will.

3. I GIVE DEVISE AND BEQUEATH the whole of my farming property known as “Boronga”, Gunningbland together with my share of the stock and plant thereon.

4. ALL THE REST AND RESIDUE of my Estate both real and personal of whatever nature and wherever situated I GIVE DEVISE AND BEQUEATH to my Daughters [the second defendant, the third defendant, the fourth defendant and the fifth defendant] in equal shares as tenants in common.”


	
	Leaving aside his speculation about how such an error could possibly have been made by him, or in his office, Mr Buckley’s evidence is to the effect that clause 3 is defective because it contains a clerical error (omission of the name of the plaintiff as beneficiary) which renders it not in accord with the instructions given to him by the deceased for its preparation.
	
	
	The principal support for this evidence is found in handwritten notes (dated 18 March 2003, eight days before the date of the will) written by Mr Buckley at or about the time he personally took instructions from the deceased.
	
	
	Those notes are in the following terms:
	


“Francis Bede Reilly

Boronga

Farmer

Peg [the first defendant] has given her farm to Joe [the plaintiff]. You own ‘Boronga’ in your name only.

Leave ‘Boronga’ to Joseph Thomas Reilly [the plaintiff] together with 2/3 of your interest in your farming P’ship FB & ML Reilly.

Residue to girls equally.

Margaret Frances MCFEE [the second defendant]

Carmel Anne FARRELL [the third defendant]

Patricia Gai CATTLE [the fifth defendant]

Genevieve Clare WALLACE [the fourth defendant]

Lengthy”.


	
	The word “lengthy” is a reference to the duration of Mr Buckley’s conference with the deceased, which he estimates to have been 40 minutes.
	
	
	The notes do not accord precisely with the scheme of the deceased’s will insofar as: (a) they include no identification of an executor; and (b) whereas the notes contemplated a share in the deceased’s farming partnership accompanying a disposition of “Boronga”, clause 3 of the will refers instead “my share of the stock and plant” on the property.
	
	
	In a letter dated 24 July 2014, written in response to a formal inquiry by the plaintiff’s solicitors, and in an affidavit sworn 5 February 2015 relied upon by the plaintiff, Mr Buckley disclaimed any independent recollection of his preparation of the deceased’s will, but affirmed that, through an oversight on his part, clause 3 of the will was incomplete.
	
	
	Mr Buckley and his clerk, Carla Peden attested the deceased’s execution of the will.
	
	
	Although Ms Peden remained in the employ of Mr Buckley’s firm at the time of the final hearing, no evidence was adduced from her. A fair inference, conforming to that discussed in Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298, is that she could give no evidence of assistance to the plaintiff.
	
	
	Mr Buckley was cross examined on his affidavit. Invited to speculate about how, and why, clause 3 of the deceased’s will takes the form it does, he accepted that his handwritten notes do not fully detail any conversation he had with the deceased at the time of taking instructions, and he could not exclude the possibility that there was an undocumented change of the deceased’s instructions at or about the time the will was executed. He acknowledged that a change of instructions might have been communicated to a member of his staff, rather than to him, and that, when witnessing a will, it was not his practice to proof read the will, before or after execution.
	
	
	Section 27 of the Succession Act 2006 is in the following terms:
	


“27 COURT MAY RECTIFY A WILL

(1) The Court may make an order to rectify a will to carry out the intentions of the testator, if the Court is satisfied the will does not carry out the testator's intentions because:

(a) a clerical error was made, or

(b) the will does not give effect to the testator's instructions.

(2) A person who wishes to make an application for an order under this section must apply to the Court within 12 months after the date of the death of the testator.

(3) However, the Court may, at any time, extend the period of time for making an application specified in subsection (2) if:

(a) the Court considers it necessary, and

(b) the final distribution of the estate has not been made.”


	
	A convenient exposition of the text of section 27 is found in Hallen AsJ’s judgment in Lockey v Ferris [2011] NSWSC 179 at [63]-[73]:
	


“63 In this case, the Plaintiff neither consents to, nor opposes, the time period for the making of the application for rectification being extended. Thus, the question which might arise, is whether the court considers it necessary to extend the period of time for the making of the application. Unlike s 29A of the Probate & Administration Act 1898, that is the sole requirement in determining the extension of the time period. ""Sufficient cause"" for not having made the application within time no longer has to be established.

64 The application may be brought after probate has been granted: The Estate of Cecil Douglas Brisbane (NSWSC, Powell J, 19 June 1992, unreported);Huszar (Re Estate of) [1999] NSWSC 388; Rawack v Spicer [2002] NSWSC 849.

65 Section 27 provides that ""[T]he Court may"". ""May"" is permissive; it is not directory, or mandatory. There is nothing in the circumstances contemplated by the section that leads to the conclusion that the Court must rectify the Will.

66 It is a condition precedent to the exercise of the power in s 27 that the Court be satisfied that the Will does not carry out the testator's intentions and that this satisfaction be based on one of two specified reasons, namely, either that a clerical error was made, or that the Will does not give effect to the testator's instructions.

67 It is clear then, that the Court must make findings about the ""intentions"" of the testator because, until it does, it cannot be satisfied that the Will does not carry out those intentions. Thus, what it was that the testator intended concerning the part of the will that is to be rectified must be established. What must be shown is the actual intention, not what the intention probably would have been had the testator thought about the matter.

68 The intention must be examined as at the date of the Will, not the date of death: Re Estate of Spinks; Application of Mortensen and Eassie (NSWSC, Needham J, 22 August 1990, unreported); and in the Court of Appeal in Bryan William Mortensen and Elizabeth Gedge Eassie v State of New South Wales, (NSWCA, 12 December 1991, unreported) at 5; Rawack v Spicer at [27] - [28]; Vescio v Bannister (Estate of the late Betty Tait ) [2010] NSWSC 1274 at [5].

69 Rawack v Spicer was cited, with approval, by Barrett J in Long v Long; Estate of Ethel Edith Long [2004] NSWSC 1002. His Honour then went on to say:

‘9 The important point is that the court must be satisfied, according to the balance of probabilities, as to not only a negative proposition (that the testatrix did not intend the will to be in the form it eventually took) but also a positive proposition (that the testatrix intended the will to be in the form for which the plaintiff contends). This is the effect of the statute and, as Sheller JA observed in Mortensen v State of New South Wales (unreported, NSWCA, 12 December 1991), the court's task is to give effect to the language of the section without paying ""over much regard to the principles evolved by equity as part of the doctrine of rectification’.

10 In Trimmer v Lax; Estate M A Fresen (unreported, NSWSC, Hodgson J, 9 May 1997), it was pointed out that a plaintiff in a proceeding of this kind must show the deceased's actual intention, not just what he or she would have intended if thought had been given to the matter.’

70 Although the standard of proof on the issue is on the balance of probabilities, clear and convincing proof is required: ( Re Estate of Dippert [2001] NSWSC 167 at [34]); Rawack v Spicer at [30] - [31].

71The meaning of "" testator's intentions "" was considered in Re Swain [2008] NSWSC 1343:

‘25 Section 29A refers to the intention of the testator. In Mortensen v New South Wales (NSWCA, 12 December 1991, unreported) Sheller JA, with whom Mahoney and Meagher JJA agreed, said that s 29A:

‘is available for mistakes, not for lack of vision or perception or knowledge. It is a section

directed at mistakes in expressing the testator's intentions.’

26 In that case the testatrix had made it manifestly clear that she did not want her money to ""go to the government"" which for all intents and purposes meant she did not want to die intestate. However, there was a failure of one of the gifts she made and the result was that there was a partial intestacy. It was argued that the testatrix's intentions were that no monies should go to the government, and accordingly the will should be rectified.

27 The Court of Appeal, like Needham J at first instance, dismissed the application. Sheller JA said that it would seem on the evidence that the will was so expressed as not to carry out the testatrix's intentions. However, the section does not only require the court to find that fact, but also to find that the court can rectify the will ""as to carry out the testator's intention"". In the Mortensen case even though the intentions were that no monies should pass to the government, the testatrix had not indicated which of the possible options she would wish to pursue had she realised that her primary gift failed. Accordingly, the will could not be rectified.’

72 If there is no evidence to show what the testator's intention was in the event of certain things happening, the Court cannot rectify the will.

73 Thus, the three questions posed by the section are, first, what were the testator's actual intentions with regard to dispositions in respect of which rectification is sought; second, is the will expressed so that it fails to carry out those intentions; and, third, is the will expressed as it is in consequence of either a clerical error, or a failure on the part of someone to whom the testator gave instructions in connection with the will, to comply with those instructions?”


	
	An order for rectification under section 27(1) cannot be made without an order under section 27(3) for an extension of the time limited by section 27(2) of the Succession Act. The deceased died on 22 December 2012. The current proceedings were commenced by a summons filed on 1 October 2014, directed principally to obtaining an extension of the operation of a caveat lodged by the plaintiff over “Boronga”. An order for proceedings on the summons to proceed by way of pleadings having been made on 8 October 2014, the plaintiff filed a statement of claim on 20 October 2014. It was by that pleading that the plaintiff applied for relief under section 27, including a prayer for an extension of time within which to apply for an order for rectification.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s caveat (which, after earlier interlocutory extensions, was on 27 October 2014 extended until further order) was lodged on “Boronga” on 11 February 2014. Implicit in the estate or interest claimed by the plaintiff in the caveat is an assertion of an entitlement to “Boronga” via the will of the deceased. He claimed that the land is held by his sisters upon trust for him, a claim which can be sustained only if clause 3 of the deceased’s will is rectified in his favour.
	
	
	In cross examination, the plaintiff confirmed that he first saw the deceased’s will in February 2013; and that he had a copy of Mr Buckley’s file note when he verified his caveat by a statutory declaration made on 20 November 2013. That he had access to legal advice at the time he verified the caveat is confirmed by the fact that his solicitor witnessed his execution of the statutory declaration.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s delay in making an application for rectification is not fully explained by the course of events following the death of the deceased. However, no application was made for a grant of representation in respect of the estate of the deceased until the plaintiff himself, in his statement of claim, applied for a grant of letters of administration; there has been no final distribution of the deceased’s estate; and, in my opinion, an order for rectification (and an associated grant of extension of time) is necessary for the purpose of giving effect to the deceased’s testamentary intentions.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the prerequisites, in section 27(3), for an extension of time have been satisfied and that a rectification order should be made pursuant to section 27(1).
	
	
	I am satisfied that the will does not carry out the testator’s intentions insofar as it omits from clause 3 the name of the plaintiff as the deceased’s intended beneficiary. I am satisfied that that omission represents a clerical error on the part of Mr Buckley, as draughtsman of the will. I am satisfied that, to give effect to the deceased’s instructions to Mr Buckley, clause 3 of the will should be rectified by inserting after the word “thereon” the words “to my Son Joseph Thomas Reilly”.
	
	
	The scheme of the will favours identification of the plaintiff as the intended beneficiary of clause 3. If the plaintiff were not the, or an, intended beneficiary of clause 3, the will would have made no provision for him whilst providing for his siblings as residuary beneficiaries in the subsequent, contrasting clause 4. The fact that the deceased named the plaintiff as his alternate executor is also consistent with an intention that the plaintiff be the recipient of a major asset, “Boronga”. These considerations reinforce a finding, open on a reading of Mr Buckley’s notes, that the plaintiff was intended by the deceased to be named in clause 3.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s long term residence on “Boronga” (as an adult, since 1995), his close personal association with farming operations on “Boronga” , his ownership (courtesy of his parents) of the adjoining property “Malaya” and the subject matter of clause 3 (the deceased’s “farming property”, together with his “share of the stock and plant thereon”) all point in the same direction, towards identification of the plaintiff as the intended beneficiary of the gift for which clause 3 imperfectly provides.
	
	
	No alternative thesis about the deceased’s testamentary intentions fits so neatly with the text or context of the will.
	


A GRANT OF ADMINISTRATION OF THE ESTATE OF THE DECEASED


	
	The Court’s order for rectification is to be accompanied by an order that letters of administration with the will (as rectified) annexed be granted to the plaintiff. His is the only application for a grant of administration. His interest in the estate of the deceased is greater than the interest of any other person.
	
	
	The deceased’s primary nominee for the role of executor was the first defendant. However, although she has executed no formal renunciation of probate, she refrained from applying for a grant before the plaintiff’s commencement of these proceedings, and she has refrained from applying for a grant in the proceedings. She has effectively abandoned her role as executrix. She cannot now be relied upon to administer the estate impartially or in an orderly manner.
	
	
	The probate jurisdiction looks to the due and proper administration of an estate, having regard to any duly expressed testamentary intentions of the deceased, and the respective interests of parties beneficially entitled to the estate. The object of the Court upon an exercise of probate jurisdiction is to carry out the deceased’s testamentary intentions, and to see that beneficiaries get what is due to them: In the Goods of William Loveday [1900] P 154 at 156; Bates v Messner (1967) 67 SR (NSW) 187 at 189 at 191-192; Estate Kouvakis [2014] NSWSC 786 at [211]; Parsons v Davison [2016] NSWSC 1491 at [8]-[9]. That object can best be served in these proceedings by a grant of administration to the plaintiff. There is no practical alternative available.
	
	
	A grant of administration in favour of the plaintiff is consistent with the order made on 26 February 2016 that, subject to further order, the plaintiff be appointed (pursuant to rule 7.10 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 NSW) to represent the estate of the deceased for the purposes of claims for family provision relief made by his sisters on their cross summons.
	


NO ADEMPTION OF THE DECEASED’S GIFT OF “BORONGA” TO THE PLAINTIFF


	
	The plaintiff’s sisters contend that, “Boronga” having been transferred to them in 2009 by the first defendant acting as attorney for the deceased, the gift of that property for which clause 3 of the deceased’s will provides must be taken to have adeemed.
	
	
	The principles governing equitable ademption (authoritatively explained in RL v NSW Trustee and Guardian (2012) 84 NSWLR 263 at 292-293) were recently reviewed in Reynolds v Bonnici [2017] NSWSC 828 at [34]-[45], drawing upon In Re Everett; Executor Trustee and Agency Company of South Australia Limited v Everett [1917] SALR 52 at 65-66. The form of ademption contended for by the plaintiff’s sisters in these proceedings is that which occurs when (because it has been destroyed or transferred out of the ownership of the will-maker) property no longer exists in the will-maker at the time, upon his or her death, a will becomes effective. It does not depend on the intention of the will-maker vis a vis the destruction or alienation of property during his or her lifetime.
	
	
	The fallacy of the defendants’ contention is that, if (as I find) the plaintiff is successful in his contention that “Boronga” should be restored to the estate of the deceased in these proceedings, it will not have been lost to the estate. There remains, in substance, an identity beteen the property “Boronga” the subject of the deceased’s specific testamentary gift in favour of the plaintiff and the property “Boronga” forming part of the deceased’s estate. On my findings, beneficial ownership of “Boronga” never left the deceased; but, critically, title to the property is recoverable by the deceased’s estate. There is no material foundation for a finding of ademption.
	
	
	For completeness, and tending in the same direction as this conclusion, I note (with elaboration of his Honour’s source text) the following observations by Young CJ in Eq in Johnston v MacLarn [2001] NSWSC 932 at paragraphs [22]-[24]:
	


“[22] The law on ademption of legacies is well set out in Roper on Legacies, 4th ed Vol 1 (William Benning & Co, Law Booksellers, London, 1847) at pp 329 and following. The general rule is that a specific legacy is adeemed if the subject property does not exist at the date of the testator’s death: Stanley v Potter (1789) 2 Cox 180; 30 ER 83; Brown v Heffer (1967) 116 CLR 344, 348. The present legacy using the words “which I hold” would seem to be specific. Thus, one looks to see whether the property existed as at the date of the death of the testatrix and if it did not then the legacy is necessarily adeemed by the annihilation of the subject matter (Roper 331). Thus, in the seminal case of Durrant v Friend (1852) 5 DeG & SM 342; 64 ER 1145, where chattels were given to a beneficiary and the testator was on a ship with the chattels and the ship sank, killing both the testator and losing the chattels, the gift was adeemed because the chattels just did not exist. The fact the testator had no intention of adeeming the gift was quite immaterial.

[23] Roper says (pp 333-4) that there are four exceptions to the general rule. The second of those exceptions is the case where a breach of trust has been committed or any trick or device practised with a view to defeating the legacy. The authority for that proposition is, of course, Shaftesbury’s case (1716) 2 Vern 747, 748; 23 ER 1089.

[24] It will also be an exception where, without the testator’s knowledge, the subject matter of the gift has been disposed of without the testator’s authority. The classic case is Basan v Brandon (1836) 8 Sim 171; 59 ER 68, where an agent disposed of the property outside the terms of the agent’s authority and without the knowledge of the testator, in which case there was no ademption.”


	
	The reference to “Roper” is more correctly a reference to RSD Roper and HH White, A Treatise on the Law of Legacies (4th ed, 1847).
	
	
	Roper’s statement of a “general rule” in terms paraphrased by Young CJ in Eq is made in his treatment of legacies of stock, leaving gifts of other forms of property to be treated (in substantially similar terms) separately.
	
	
	In terms stated by Roper (at pages 329-334), “the general rule” and four “qualifications” to that rule (described by Young CJ in Eq as “exceptions”) focus on whether there is an exact agreement between the terms in which the property the subject of a specific legacy is described in a testator’s will and property of which the testator is possessed at the time of death.
	
	
	The four “qualifications” elaborated by Roper focus on cases in which, although there is not an exact agreement between the will and a testator’s extant property, there is in substance a correspondence between the property described in the will and the property to which, at the time of death, the testator is beneficially entitled.
	
	
	The first “qualification” is said to occur when property possessed by a testator at the time of death takes a different form from that described in his will by a mere act or operation of law. The second “qualification” (specifically referred to by Young CJ in Eq) concerns a change arising from a transaction unauthorised by the testator or a breach of trust. The third “qualification” is said to occur when a fund, instead of being “annihilated”, remains the same or in substance the same, as at the date of the testator’s will, “with some unimportant alterations”, so as not materially to change the interest which the testator then had; an example identified by Roper in a marginal note is when there is a change by a mere transfer from trustees to the testator, or from old to new trustees, or upon fresh securities under powers so to do. The fourth “qualification” occurs in instances where a testator lends stock, specifically bequeathed, on condition of its being replaced so that a legatee is entitled to have the subject property (which the trustee substantially and beneficially continues to possess) redeemed so as to pass by will.
	
	
	The four “qualifications” or “exceptions” set out by Roper are, at page 331, introduced by a marginal note in the following terms: “Qualifications of the rule, requiring an exact agreement between the subject and its specification”.
	
	
	The second “qualification” is introduced by a marginal note in the following terms: “When changed without testator’s concurrence or authority, or fraudulently, or in breach of trust”.
	
	
	Omitting footnotes, the second “qualification” or “exception” is expressed by Roper (at pages 332-333) in the following terms:
	


“The law will not permit a fraudulent transaction to operate to the injury of any person, whilst there remain any means to make reparation. Hence, a second qualification of [the rule requiring an exact agreement between the subject of a specific legacy and its specification] may happen where a breach of trust has been committed, or any trick or device practised with a view to defeat the specific legacy. Suppose, then, stock specifically bequeathed, to be sold or transferred into another fund by a trustee, without the knowledge or authority of the testator. It is conceived that such a transaction would not be permitted to defeat the bequest, upon the principle that the act of a trustee will not be allowed to prejudice the cestui que trust, or the persons claiming under him; and that a Court of Equity will consider, for the purposes of justice, the stock as still subsisting in the fund described, and answering the specification in the will. It is also presumed, that the legatee is entitled to follow the subject into other funds, or to full recompense out of the trustee’s property, as the nature of the case may require.

In Basan v Brandon, it was decided, that neither the alteration of the state of the specific fund, by the agent of the testator, without authority, nor the unexecuted intention of the testator to change the state of the fund, will adeem a specific legacy part of that fund”.


	
	Shaftesbury v Shaftesbury, referred to by Young CJ in Eq, is not dealt with in Roper’s treatment of the ademption of stock (at pages 329-334) but it is cited, in a similar context, at page 344 in dealing with “ademption of specific legacies of goods, etc.”
	


THE PLAINTIFF’S CLAIM FOR RESTORATION OF “BORONGA” TO THE ESTATE OF THE DECEASED


	
	Whether “Boronga” should be restored to the estate depends on: (a) whether the first defendant acted without power, or in breach of her fiduciary obligations to the deceased, in transferring it to her daughters; (b) whether, the property having been transferred to them, section 42 of the Real Property Act 1900 NSW gives the daughters an indefeasible title to the property; and (c) whether, in equity, the sisters are bound to hold the property on trust for the estate of the deceased.
	


The First Defendant’s assertion of an Oral Agreement between the Deceased and Herself


	
	Before those, and associated, questions are addressed there is a need to address the first defendant’s foundational assertions of fact: (a) that, in 2000, she and the deceased made an oral agreement that, if she transferred “Malaya” to the plaintiff, he would leave “Boronga” to their daughters; (b) that she transferred “Malaya” to the plaintiff in reliance on that agreement; and (c) that she transferred “Boronga” to her daughters in performance of the deceased’s “obligation” to leave that property to them.
	
	
	I am not satisfied that there was ever an agreement, or any informal arrangement, between the deceased and the first defendant to the effect that, if the first defendant transferred “Malaya” to the plaintiff, the deceased would leave “Boronga” to the girls. That is because:
	



	
	there is no contemporaneous record of any agreement between the deceased and the first defendant of the type to which the first defendant deposes.
	
	
	a letter dated 10 April 2000 written by the first defendant’s then solicitor to the plaintiff and copied to her (Exhibit P1) was couched in terms that described “a possible intergenerational transfer of [the first defendant’s] farm ‘Malaya’ to [the plaintiff]” as a reward for faithful service on the farm, and as a means of continuing the family farming partnership, without any suggestion that the proposed transfer was part of an arrangement about the future disposition of “Boronga”.
	
	
	that letter was written shortly before the deceased executed his power of attorney in favour of the plaintiff and the first defendant jointly and severally (on 7 June 2000) and the first defendant executed the memorandum of transfer (later registered as Dealing No. 6899811Q) that transferred “Malaya” to the plaintiff. The memorandum of transfer bears the date 26 June 2000, accompanied by a reference to the date 16 June 2000 under the plaintiff’s signature as transferee. It was registered on or about 7 July 2000.
	
	
	the terms in which the letter dated 10 April 2000 were written suggest that the parties were not unmindful of taxation implications of a transfer of “Malaya” to the plaintiff, an observation reinforced by the fact that the memorandum of transfer in favour of the plaintiff is marked “No [Stamp] Duty payable”. In the absence of any contemporaneous written record of the agreement that the first defendant says she had with the deceased, the fact that there were, or may have been, economic imperatives for the transfer of the land to the plaintiff is consistent with, if not confirmation of, the absence of the alleged agreement in fact.
	
	
	between 1997 and 2003 (in the lead up to the deceased’s execution of his will dated 26 March 2003) a neighbour with an expressed interest in acquiring “Boronga” from the deceased (Peter Thomas Reilly, a nephew of the deceased and the first defendant) had several conversations with the first defendant in which: (i) he asked the first defendant what she thought the deceased would do with “Boronga”; and (ii) she replied with words to the effect, “I don’t care what [the deceased] does with the property, so long as he does not leave it to me”.
	
	
	at a time in about 2003 when the deceased had declared to his neighbour an intention to see Mr Buckley about making a will, the neighbour had with the first defendant a similar conversation about the deceased’s intentions in which, the neighbour recalls, the first defendant said words to the effect that “[the deceased] can do whatever he likes with ‘Boronga’, so long as he doesn’t leave it to me”.
	
	
	the plaintiff deposes to having heard conversations between his parents to the same effect, in about March 2003, when he was living with them in the homestead on “Boronga”.
	
	
	although the deceased’s testamentary intentions as manifested in 2003 (in Mr Buckley’s notes dated 18 March 2003 and, as I have found, the will dated 26 March 2003) need to be approached with caution upon any independent assessment of the evidence and intentions of the first defendant, the fact that the deceased evidently felt at liberty to leave “Boronga” to the plaintiff rather than to his daughters is not wholly irrelevant in a family in which there had long been, and there continued to be, close cooperation in the conduct of a family farming business.
	
	
	the evidence is consistent with the absence of any agreement between the deceased and the first defendant of the type alleged by the first defendant, and with the development in the first defendant of a strong, subjective opinion (perhaps encouraged by representations of the fifth defendant, who aided her in effecting a transfer of “Boronga” to the daughters in 2009) that fairness between siblings justified, if not mandated, a transfer of “Boronga” to the girls.
	
	
	when instructing the sixth defendant’s firm to effect the transfer of “Boronga” to her daughters, the first defendant did not tell the sixth defendant, or his employee, of the alleged agreement between the deceased and herself.
	
	
	she did not tell any of her children of the alleged agreement at that time.
	
	
	if the first defendant’s evidence is accepted, her husband (with whom she had a close and loving relationship) misled her in March 2003 when, on her evidence, in anticipation of making his will later that month, he expressly affirmed to her an intention to leave “Boronga” to their daughters, an intention not subsequently disclaimed.
	



	
	In disbelieving the first defendant’s evidence about the existence of an agreement between the deceased and herself, it is not necessary to go so far as to find that she is a person of doubtful credit. It is sufficient to note, as McLelland CJ in Eq did in Watson v Foxman (1995) 49 CLR 315 at 318-319, the fallibility of human memory and the capacity of the human mind for ex poste rationalisation of events long since passed. To this might be added the Court’s customary caution (often signposted with a reference to Plunkett v Bull (1915) 19 CLR 544 at 548-549) in the assessment of evidence of oral statements attributed to a deceased person.
	
	
	Just as I am not satisfied that there was ever any agreement between the deceased and the first defendant to the effect that, if the first defendant transferred “Malaya” to the plaintiff, the deceased would leave “Boronga” to their daughters, so I am not satisfied that the first defendant, in 2009, effected a transfer of “Boronga” to the daughters in reliance upon (or even by reference to) such an agreement.
	
	
	In final submissions counsel for the plaintiff was criticised for not (it was said) sufficiently, or formally, confronting the first defendant in cross examination with an explicit refutation of her evidence about the existence of, and reliance upon, an informal agreement between herself and the deceased about her entitlement to transfer “Boronga” to their daughters. I do not accept that criticism.
	
	
	Throughout the hearing there was never any doubt that the first defendant’s assertion of such an entitlement was under challenge. A cross examiner of the first defendant was not obliged to create sympathy in her favour by a robust confrontation. There was nothing unfair in a more subtle cross examination. The first defendant, represented by competent counsel, was on notice that her evidence was under challenge. The so-called “rule” in Browne v Dunn (1894) 6 R 67 requires no more: Allied Pastoral Holdings Pty Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [1983] 1 NSWLR 1.
	
	
	Although each of the defendants submits that I should accept the first defendant’s evidence about a justification for her conduct grounded in an informal agreement with the deceased, nobody contends that I am bound to accept that evidence. As it happens, for the reasons I have explained, I do not accept it.
	
	
	In my assessment, more probably than not the first defendant effected the 2009 transfer primarily because of her strong, personal, subjective opinion that that is what “fairness” between her children required she do, encouraged in that opinion by the fifth defendant who assisted her in instructions given to the sixth defendant (as solicitor for all parties to the transaction), with the acquiescence of each of the second, third and fourth defendants (each of whom, with the fifth defendant, made a declaration under the Duties Act 1997 NSW in support of an application for exemption from stamp duty on the transfer).
	
	
	The first defendant denies location of her motivation in the possibility that a divestiture of “Boronga” would, in time, assist her to have the deceased’s ongoing nursing home fees ($50,000 per year which, she says, she personally paid) met by social security. That denial cannot be accepted in light of a file note dated 16 April 2009 prepared by the sixth defendant’s employee as a contemporaneous record of instructions given to him by the first and fifth defendants as a preliminary to the 2009 transfer. There appears to have been a clear connection between the proposed transfer and a purpose of moving the deceased towards pension entitlements by reducing the value of assets in his name. Accordingly, I infer, a secondary motivation of the first defendant in effecting the 2009 transfer was to relieve herself of costs associated with the deceased’s nursing home care.
	
	
	The first defendant’s 2009 transfer of “Boronga” to her daughters was not in accordance with the intentions of the deceased (testamentary or otherwise), and not for his benefit, but, essentially, to give immediate effect to the first defendant’s personal preference for what should be done with the property and, possibly, at future time, to relieve her of costs associated with his maintenance.
	
	
	She had no authority to transfer the property to her daughters unless it be located in the power of attorney dated 7 June 2000, upon which instrument she expressly purported to rely in her execution of the memorandum of transfer dated 1 July 2009 as attorney for the deceased. There is no general rule of agency between married, or cohabiting, couples; whether there is a relationship of agency between such couples depends on the facts of the particular case: Pollard v Wilson [2010] NSWCA 68 at [113]. In this case, the power of attorney dated 7 June 2000 is the only identified source of the first defendant’s actual authority.
	
	
	The memorandum of transfer was accompanied by a “contract for the sale of land” (expressed to be between the deceased as vendor and his daughters as purchasers), also dated 1 July 2009, which purported to sell “Boronga”, including the house and other improvements on the property, with vacant possession, for the price of $1.00. That contract was signed by the first defendant on behalf of the deceased as vendor.
	


The Power of Attorney


	
	The power of attorney dated 7 June 2000 took the form of an adaptation of a printed form.
	
	
	At the time of its creation, the instrument was governed by Part 16 (sections 158-163H) of the Conveyancing Act 1919 NSW, since repealed by the Powers of Attorney Act 2003 NSW, section 6(3) of which preserved the operation of the repealed provisions vis a vis the instrument.
	
	
	Omitting the execution clause and the accompanying certificate given by Mr Buckley under section 163F(2) of the Conveyancing Act 1919, the power of attorney was in the following terms:
	


“General Power of Attorney

Part 1

THIS POWER OF ATTORNEY is made on the 7th day of June 2000

by FRANCIS BEDE REILLY

of “Boronga”, Gunningbland

1.   I appoint MARGARET LILIAN REILLY

of “Boronga”, Gunningbland

and JOSEPH THOMAS REILLY

of “Boronga”, Gunningbland

to be my attorney(s) (where more than one jointly and/or severally) to exercise, subject to any conditions and limitations specified in Part 2 of this Instrument, the authority conferred on him/her/them by Section 163B of the Conveyancing Act, 1919, to do on my behalf anything I may lawfully authorise an attorney to do.

      2. …

3.   This general power of attorney is given with the intention that it will continue to be effective notwithstanding that after its execution I suffer loss of capacity through unsoundness of mind.

Part 2

CONDITIONS AND LIMITATIONS”


	
	Clause 2 of the printed form, adapted by deletion, formerly read as follows:
	


“In the exercise of the authority conferred on him/her/them by Section 163B of the Conveyancing Act, 1919, my attorney(s) is/are authorised to execute an assurance or other document, or do any other act, whereby a benefit is conferred on him/her/them.”


	
	No “condition” or “limitation” was recorded in Part 2 of the instrument signed by the deceased.
	
	
	At the time the power of attorney was executed, section 163B of the Conveyancing Act 1919 was in the following terms:
	


“163B Power conferred by prescribed form of instrument

(1) Subject to this section, an instrument (whether or not under seal) in or to the effect of the form in Schedule 7 confers on the attorney thereby appointed authority to do on behalf of the person executing the instrument anything the person executing the instrument may lawfully authorise an attorney to do.

(2) The authority conferred by an instrument referred to in subsection (1) does not include:

(a) authority to exercise or perform any power, authority, duty or function as a trustee conferred or imposed on the person executing the instrument, or

(b) unless it is expressly conferred by the instrument—authority to execute an assurance or other document, or do any other act, as a result of which a benefit would be conferred on the attorney appointed by the instrument.   

(3) Where an instrument referred to in subsection (1) specifies any conditions or limitations to which the authority conferred by the instrument is to be subject, the authority is so conferred subject to compliance with those conditions or limitations.”


	
	The power of attorney granted by the deceased was “in or to the effect of the form of Schedule 7” as required by section 163B.
	
	
	Section 163F(2) of the Conveyancing Act (pursuant to which Mr Buckley executed a certificate in support of the power of attorney at the time of its execution) was in the following terms:
	


“(2) Where:

(a) a power of attorney is, in the instrument creating the power, expressed to be given with the intention that it will continue to be effective notwithstanding that, after the execution of the instrument, the principal suffers loss of capacity through unsoundness of mind,

(b) the execution of the instrument is attested by a prescribed person (not being an attorney under the power), and

(c) there is endorsed on, or annexed to, the instrument a certificate by that prescribed person stating that the prescribed person explained the effect of the instrument to the principal before it was executed,

the power of attorney is effective so far as concerns any act within its scope, notwithstanding that the act is of a nature which is, at the time of the act, beyond the understanding of the principal through unsoundness of mind.”


	
	So far as is material, section 163 of the Conveyancing Act provided as follows:
	


“163 Registration of powers of attorney

(1) Any instrument … creating a power of attorney for any purpose whatever may be registered.

(2) … [No] conveyance or other deed not being a lease or agreement for a lease for a term not exceeding 3 years, and no memorandum by this Act

operating as a deed executed by the attorney under the power in pursuance of the power shall be of any force or validity whatsoever unless the instrument creating the power has been registered:

Provided that on registration of the instrument creating the power every such conveyance deed or memorandum executed by the attorney under the power shall take effect as if the instrument creating the power had been registered before the execution of the conveyance deed or memorandum.

(3) Any instrument revoking any such power may also be registered. …”


	
	The deceased’s power of attorney was not registered by the deceased or by Mr Buckley acting on his instructions.
	
	
	It was registered on 6 July 2009 by the sixth defendant’s firm, acting on the instructions of the first defendant, without express notice to the plaintiff, for the purpose of giving effect to the memorandum of transfer dated 1 July 2009 executed by her in favour of her daughters.
	
	
	Although not given express notice of the first defendant’s intention to register the power of attorney, the plaintiff deposed to a conversation with her “in about mid-2009” in which she told him that she proposed to transfer “Boronga” to “the kids” and he would have no say in that transaction. He was, to that extent, implicitly on notice of both an intention to register the power of attorney and an intention to transfer “Boronga”, or at least an interest in “Boronga”, to his sisters.
	
	
	The effect of section 163B(2)(b) of the Conveyancing Act, given the deletion of clause 2 from the printed form, was that the deceased’s power of attorney did not confer on the first defendant (or, for that matter, the plaintiff) “authority to execute an assurance or other document, or do any other act, as a result of which a benefit would be conferred on the attorney appointed by the instrument”. No party contends otherwise.
	


The first Defendant’s Obligations as a Fiduciary, Limits on her Powers and Findings of Breach


	
	Whatever the precise limits of the first defendant’s powers as the deceased’s attorney, the relationship between them, as principal and attorney, was a fiduciary one, a consequence of which was that the first defendant was obliged not to place herself in a position of conflict, nor to obtain a profit or benefit from her fiduciary position, without first obtaining the fully informed consent of the deceased: Taheri v Vitek (2014) 87 NSWLR 403 at 427(115); Downie v Langham [2017] NSWSC 113 at [8]; Hospital Products Pty Limited v United States Surgical Corporation (1984) 156 CLR 41 at 68, 96 and 141; Chan v Zacharia (1984) 154 CLR 178 at 198-199; Maguire v Makaronis (1997) 188 CLR 449 at 466-467. These obligations flowed from the obligation of loyalty owed by the first defendant (to act, bona fide, only in the interests, and for the benefit, of the deceased as her principal) when she accepted her appointment, and thereafter purported to act, as an attorney.
	
	
	In circumstances in which the deceased no longer possessed the mental capacity to give his fully informed consent to a proscribed transaction proposed by the first defendant as his attorney, she could nevertheless have effected the transaction without a breach of her fiduciary obligations had she sought and obtained authorisation via an order of the Court, or the Guardianship Tribunal (now the Guardianship Division of the Civil and Administrative Tribunal of NSW (NCAT)), exercising protective jurisdiction, in effect, on behalf of the deceased or upon an application for advice or directions under section 38 of the Powers of Attorney Act 2003. This she did not do.
	
	
	As a fiduciary, the first defendant was bound to exercise her powers as an attorney for the deceased in his interests and not otherwise: Hospital Products Limited v United States Surgical Corporation (1984) 156 CLR 41 at 96-97.
	
	
	The primary object of a power of attorney is to enable the attorney to act in the management of his or her principal’s affairs; an attorney cannot, in the absence of a clear power so to do, make presents to himself or herself or to others of his or her principal’s property: Tobin v Broadbent (1947) 75 CLR 378 at 401 (quoting Reckitt v Barnett Pembroke and Slater Limited [1928] 2KB 244 at 268, approved in the House of Lords [1929] AC 176 at 183 and 195), recently applied by the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia in Great Investments Limited v Warner (2016) 243 FCR 516 at 538[85].
	
	
	Under the general law of agency it is a breach of duty for an agent to exercise his or her authority for the purpose of conferring a benefit on himself or herself or upon some other person to the detriment of his or her principal. But, at the same time, if his or her act is otherwise within the scope of his authority it binds the principal in favour of third parties who deal with him bona fide and without notice of his fraud: Richard Brady Franks Limited v Price (1937) 58 CLR 112 at 142.
	
	
	Where a fiduciary (such as an agent) exercises a power which results in his or her obtaining some incidental benefit, there may be nothing per se improper with his or her having that benefit if the benefit itself is, in the circumstances, an inevitable consequence of his or her properly exercising the power which produces it. A beneficiary (principal) may be able to upset such an exercise of power only if he or she can show that the fiduciary (agent) exercised it with the dominant purpose in mind of obtaining that benefit irrespective of the interests of his beneficiary (principal): Paul Finn, Fiduciary Obligations (Federation Press, Sydney, 2016 reprint), paragraphs [103]-[104], citing, inter alia, Smith v Cock (1911) 12 CLR 30 at 36.
	
	
	These general law principles apply in the current proceedings. They were not displaced by the Part 16 of the Conveyancing Act 1919, still less by the Powers of Attorney Act 2003 NSW: Powers of Attorney Act 2003 NSW, sections 6-7.
	
	
	The plaintiff contends that the first defendant acted outside her authority as the deceased’s attorney, and in breach of fiduciary obligations owed by her to the deceased, in that she transferred assets of the deceased (principally “Boronga”, but also the deceased’s interest in the FB & ML Reilly Partnership) for her own benefit; namely:
	



	
	immediately, to achieve her own end (giving effect to her personal concept of fairness as between her children), a non-economic benefit enjoyed by her (the satisfaction of achieving her own design); and
	
	
	prospectively, to relieve herself of costs associated with the deceased’s nursing home care by divesting him of assets so as to qualify him, after a lapse of five years, for pension entitlements.
	



	
	The plaintiff contends, further, that the first defendant acted beyond her power as an attorney by unilaterally procuring registration of the deceased’s power of attorney. That contention is articulated in written submissions as follows:
	


“[56] What occurred after 1 July 2009, when the first defendant executed the ‘Boronga’ transfer, was that the first defendant herself enlarged the power given to her on 7 June 2000 by unilaterally procuring registration of the deceased’s power of attorney. The first defendant gave to herself an additional power to transfer land.

[57] Were the terms of the power of attorney dated 7 June 2000 such that the attorney herself was authorised to enlarge or expand those powers? The deceased had made a choice. He had expressly limited the attorneys’ powers by declining to register the power of attorney on or after 7 June 2000. The registration of the power of attorney after the deceased lost capacity implicitly limited the first defendant’s ability to apply the deceased’s estate other than for his benefit.

[58] The boundaries of the first defendant’s power was set by the deceased. The attorney was authorised to ‘do on my behalf anything I may lawfully authorise an attorney to do.’ The source of the power or authority must always have been the deceased. He could not delegate to the first defendant a power to enlarge the scope of her agency. If the given power was that wide, the first defendant could have authorised acts which had been expressly precluded by the deceased.

[59] Just as the deceased expressly limited the powers to exclude self benefits, he also precluded the valid execution of instruments transferring land by declining to register his power of attorney. The later acts of the first defendant in executing the ‘Boronga’ transfer, procuring registration of the power of attorney and registering the ‘Boronga’ transfer to achieve her own ends were all ultra vires acts.”


	
	For the following reasons, I do not accept that the first defendant, by procuring registration of the deceased’s power of attorney, was acting beyond power:
	



	
	Reflecting both section 163B(1) and section 163B(3) of the Conveyancing Act, the power conferred by clause 1 (in Part 1) of the power of attorney was accompanied by an absence of specified Part 2 “Conditions and Limitations”. There was thus no express condition or limitation on the attorneys’ power to do on behalf of the deceased anything he could lawfully authorise an attorney to do.
	
	
	There is no impediment in law to a principal authorising an attorney to register the attorney’s instrument of appointment merely because the legal effect of registration is to remove the barrier to land dealings for which section 163(2) of the Conveyancing Act provides. The exceptions in, and the proviso to, section 163(2) demonstrate that the subsection is directed, not to the intrinsic validity of an instrument, but to maintenance of the integrity of systems of registration governing Torrens title and old system land. The exception relating to a short term lease reflects the exception for which section 42(1)(d) of the Real Property Act 1900 NSW provides in relation to unregistered Torrens title instruments. The exception relating to memoranda operating as deeds ties in with the definition of “deed” in section 7 of the Conveyancing Act, the provisions of section 38 of the Act governing the execution of a deed and the system for registration of deeds for which Part 23 of the Act provides. Section 163(2) ensures that, if an instrument affecting land has been executed by an attorney, the instrument conferring power on the attorney to execute it is searchable in circumstances consistent with the systems governing registration.
	
	
	There is no element of delegation by the principal to the attorney of a power to “enlarge” the scope of an agency by the principal leaving to the attorney the ministerial act of registering the attorney’s instrument of appointment.
	
	
	To hold otherwise, upon a construction of sections 163(2) and 163B of the Conveyancing Act, in respect of a power of attorney unconstrained by specified “conditions” or “limitations”, would be productive of mischief because, in each case, a third party dealing with an attorney in relation to land might be required (notwithstanding a form of protection for which section 162 of the Act provides for those dealing with an attorney) to investigate the circumstances in which a power of attorney came to be registered: was the instrument registered by, or otherwise with the authority of, the principal? An object of the legislation is to provide certainty for third parties dealing with an attorney: Taheri v Vitek (2014) 87 NSWLR 403 at 431. To construe it as the plaintiff contends would not serve, but would detract from, that object.
	
	
	There is no evidence in the present proceedings that the deceased’s power of attorney was delivered to his attorneys, in escrow, on a condition that it not be registered, or subject to any other form of condition as to registration extrinsic to its terms.
	
	
	Given that the deceased’s attorneys were empowered to act jointly or severally, it was open to the first defendant, as a matter of power, to act unilaterally in registration of the instrument of their appointment.
	



	
	I do not accept that the first defendant’s secondary purpose of (possibly) relieving herself of costs associated with the deceased’s nursing home care, by effecting a transfer of “Boronga” to others, of itself involved a want of authority or a breach of her obligations as a fiduciary. If it be the fact (as she has asserted, without corroborative evidence as to her source of funds) that the first defendant paid for the deceased’s nursing home care she would have been entitled, as an agent who expended money for the benefit of her principal, to be indemnified by him or his estate: Re Clune; Ex parte Verge v Isabella Nominees Pty Limited (In Liq) (1988) 14 ACLR 261 at 266; Mega-Top Cargo Pty Limited v Moneytech Services Pty Limited [2015] NSWCA 402 at [41]-[48]. Of itself, conduct directed towards diminution of costs chargeable to the deceased or his estate would not fall outside the deceased’s general grant of authority “to do on my behalf anything I may lawfully authorise an attorney to do” or attract characterisation as an exercise of that authority for an improper purpose. There is no allegation that the first defendant’s conduct was unlawful because, for example, tainted by revenue fraud.
	
	
	The gravamen of the plaintiff’s case is that, in disposing of the deceased’s assets in 2009, the first defendant preferred her own interests over those of her husband and sought, by conferral of benefits on her daughters, both to benefit herself and, by an improvident transaction (effectively, a gift), to divest the deceased of property. Foundational to this case is a contention that the first defendant (if not also each of her daughters) is liable to account to the estate of the deceased for benefits conferred on the daughters, at her direction, in breach of fiduciary obligations owed to the deceased.
	
	
	The fact that the 2009 transfer of “Boronga” in favour of the daughters was, as I have found, contrary to the deceased’s testamentary intentions does not, of itself, establish that the transfer was invalid or that it involved a breach of the first defendant’s fiduciary obligations. The general grant of power “to do on my behalf anything I may lawfully authorise an attorney to do” was sufficiently broad to enable an attorney, acting bona fide and in the interests of the principal, to do an act which effected an ademption of a prospective testamentary gift of the principal.
	
	
	The defendants contend, and I accept, that, although the deceased’s power of attorney denied to the first defendant power to confer a benefit on herself, it implicitly included a power to make a gift in favour of a third party.
	
	
	However, the first defendant’s power to make a gift in favour of a third party was not unqualified. It was qualified in at least two respects:
	



	
	It was qualified by the fiduciary obligation of loyalty owed by the first defendant to the deceased as his attorney: Spina v Permanent Custodians Limited [2008] NSWSC 561; (2008) 13 BPR 25,463 at [113]-[121] and [153]; Ward v Ward (No. 2) [2011] NSWSC 1292 at [3]; Cohen v Cohen [2016] NSWSC 336 at [62]-[67].
	
	
	It was qualified by an obligation to exercise the power of attorney bona fide and not for an improper, foreign purpose (that is, an obligation not to commit a “fraud on the power”): GE Dal Pont, Powers of Attorney (Lexis Nexis Butterworths, Australia, 2nd ed, 2015), paragraphs [6.64]-[6.65]; PW Young, C Croft and ML Smith, On Equity (Law Book Co, Sydney, 2009), paragraphs [8.880]-[8.950]; G Thomas, Thomas on Powers (Oxford University Press, 2nd ed, 2012), Ch 9, especially paragraphs [9.01]-[9.05] and [9.90]-[9.91]; Vatcher v Paull [1915] AC 372 at 378.
	



	
	The first defendant’s gift of “Boronga” (the deceased’s main asset) to their daughters, for the purpose of giving effect to her own personal view of what was fair as between her siblings, and not for the purpose of advancing the interests (or for the benefit) of the deceased, was both a fraud on the power conferred on her by the deceased’s power of attorney and a breach of her fiduciary obligations to the deceased. Cf, Cohen v Cohen [2016] NSWSC 336 at [65]-[67].
	
	
	The gift was a “fraud on the power” because the first defendant exercised her power “for a purpose, or with an intention, beyond the scope of or not justified by the instrument creating the power”: Vatcher v Paull [1915] AC 372 at 378. It is not necessary for such a finding to characterise the first defendant’s conduct as “dishonest” or “immoral”. It is sufficient to characterise it as beyond the power conferred upon her.
	
	
	As a “fraud on the power” the transfer of “Boronga” to the deceased’s daughters was void (Thomas on Powers (2nd ed), paragraphs [9.90]-[9.91]) or, at least, voidable (Richard Brady Franks Limited v Price (1937) 58 CLR 112 at 142) subject to:
	



	
	the daughters’ contention that they were entitled to rely upon the first defendant’s apparent or ostensible authority to act as agent for the deceased even if she lacked actual authority (Taheri v Vitek (2014) 87 NSWLR 403 at 426-428); and
	
	
	the operation of the Real Property Act 1900, section 42.
	



	
	In any event, as a defaulting fiduciary (an accounting party) the first defendant has a personal liability to restore the estate of the deceased (Re Dawson (deceased) [1966] 2 NSWR 211; 84 WN (Pt 1) (NSW) 399; Maguire v Makaronis  (1997) 188 CLR 449 at 469-470; Youyang Pty Limited v Minter Ellison Morris Fletcher  (2003) 212 CLR 484), by accounting for any profit or gain received by her or by compensating the deceased’s estate for any loss suffered by it, arising from her transfer of “Boronga” to her daughters. She cannot circumvent her liability to account as a fiduciary by eschewing a personal benefit deliberately directed by her to a third party by way of a gift.
	
	
	If (as in the present proceedings) an attorney:
	



	
	in breach of fiduciary obligations owed, as an attorney, to his, her or its principal;
	
	
	without the authority or fully informed consent of the principal;
	
	
	for an improper purpose serving the attorney’s own interests; and
	
	
	at the expense of, and without benefit to, the principal, directs that property of the principal be transferred by way of gift to a third party,
	


is the attorney liable to account to the principal for that property (to restore the estate of the principal) although not personally a recipient of it?


	
	That question must be answered in the affirmative for at least two reasons. First, Equity intervenes to hold the attorney to his, her or its duties as a fiduciary; it requires restitution in kind or compensation. Secondly, it also looks to substance over form. The posited case is no different from a transfer of the principal’s property by an attorney to him, her or itself, followed immediately by a transfer by the attorney to a third party. The attorney’s conscience is no less affected by one form of transaction than it is by the other. The attorney cannot circumvent personal liability of a fiduciary to account for an estate by causing the principal’s property to be transferred to a third party of the attorney’s choice rather than to the attorney personally.
	
	
	In Huguenin v Baseley (1807) 14 Ves 273 at 289; 33 ER 526 at 532 Lord Eldon paraphrased Lord Hardwicke, in Bridgeman v Green (1755) 2 Ves Sen 627 at 629; 28 ER 399 at 401, as observing “justly that, if a person could get out of the reach of the doctrine and principle of [a court of equity] by giving interests to third persons, instead of reserving them to himself, it would be almost impossible ever to reach a case of fraud.” Although this observation was directed to explaining why a transfer of property to a third party should be set aside, it is not without resonance upon an assessment of the liability of a defaulting fiduciary.
	
	
	If “Boronga” is restored to the estate of the deceased by the second to fifth defendants as a consequence of these proceedings, and if (because all parties interested in the estate of the deceased have put it beyond the power of anyone to complain of loss to the estate from use of the land) there is no compensable loss recoverable by the estate arising out of “Boronga” passing for a time out of the legal ownership of the deceased, the orders to be made against the first defendant might be confined to orders providing for the costs of the proceedings.
	
	
	Questions about the appropriate form of relief must await determination of the plaintiff’s case against his sisters.
	
	
	By her defence the first defendant does not plead (as do her daughters) a defence of acquiescence (Orr v Ford (1989) 167 CLR 316 at 337-342; Byrnes v Kendle (2011) 243 CLR 253 at 279[79]-280[80]) based upon the plaintiff’s contemporaneous knowledge of the “Boronga” transfer and his participation in the Shadrack partnership. Consideration of that defence is best left until consideration of the plaintiff’s case against his sisters.
	


The Plaintiff’s Case against his Sisters


	
	The Parameters of Dispute. On the first day of the final hearing the plaintiff’s sisters amended their defence to include reliance upon section 42 of the Real Property Act 1900, advancing a contention that, by reason of their registration as proprietors of “Boronga”, they hold the land free of any claim made by or on behalf of the estate of the deceased to recover it. In short, they contend that, by registration (and, as volunteers, not before registration), they acquired indefeasibility of title (Breveskar v Wall (1971) 126 CLR 376 at 385-386; Cassegrain v Gerard Cassegrain & Co Pty Limited (2015) 254 CLR 425 at 433[16]; and  Corin v Patton (1990) 169 CLR 540 at 557-558), leaving the plaintiff to establish, on behalf of the estate of the deceased, a case coming within an exception to indefeasibility.
	
	
	Section 42 is in the following terms (with emphasis added):
	


“42 ESTATE OF REGISTERED PROPRIETOR PARAMOUNT

(1) Notwithstanding the existence in any other person of any estate or interest which but for this Act might be held to be paramount or to have priority, the registered proprietor for the time being of any estate or interest in land recorded in a folio of the Register shall, except in case of fraud, hold the same, subject to such other estates and interests and such entries, if any, as are recorded in that folio, but absolutely free from all other estates and interests that are not so recorded except:

(a) the estate or interest recorded in a prior folio of the Register by reason of which another proprietor claims the same land,

(a1) in the case of the omission or misdescription of an easement subsisting immediately before the land was brought under the provisions of this Act or validly created at or after that time under this or any other Act or a Commonwealth Act,

(b) in the case of the omission or misdescription of any profit à prendre created in or existing upon any land,

(c) as to any portion of land that may by wrong description of parcels or of boundaries be included in the folio of the Register or registered dealing evidencing the title of such registered proprietor, not being a purchaser or mortgagee thereof for value, or deriving from or through a purchaser or mortgagee thereof for value, and

(d) a tenancy whereunder the tenant is in possession or entitled to immediate possession, and an agreement or option for the acquisition by such a tenant of a further term to commence at the expiration of such a tenancy, of which in either case the registered proprietor before he or she became registered as proprietor had notice against which he or she was not protected:

Provided that:

(i) The term for which the tenancy was created does not exceed 3 years, and

(ii) in the case of such an agreement or option, the additional term for which it provides would not, when added to the original term, exceed 3 years.

(2) In subsection (1), a reference to an estate or interest in land recorded in a folio of the Register includes a reference to an estate or interest recorded in a registered mortgage, charge or lease that may be directly or indirectly identified from a distinctive reference in that folio.

(3) This section prevails over any inconsistent provision of any other Act or law unless the inconsistent provision expressly provides that it is to have effect despite anything contained in this section.”


	
	No case available to the estate of the deceased falls within the five paragraphs of exceptions set out in the latter part of section 42(1).
	
	
	During the course of the hearing, the plaintiff declined an opportunity to amend his statement of claim to allege a case of “fraud” which, if established, would have enlivened the fraud exception, located in the earlier part of section 42(1). “Fraud”, in that sense, involves moral turpitude as an essential element: Bahr v Nicolay (No. 2) (1988) 164 CLR 604 at 4. The plaintiff does not allege, as he would have to establish if he pleaded “fraud” in this sense, that his sisters were guilty of moral turpitude.
	
	
	The case for which the plaintiff contends is that the estate of the deceased has a personal right, in equity, enforceable against the registered proprietors, requiring them to restore the land to the estate. This “personal equities” exception to indefeasibility does not deny the title of the registered proprietors, but asserts a personal right against them: Hillpalm Pty Limited v Heaven’s Door Pty Limited (2004) 220 CLR 472 at 491[54], citing Frazer v Walker [1967] 1 AC 569 at 585.
	
	
	Understandably “the rule in Barnes v Addy” featured in submissions about any accessorial or participatory liability of the plaintiff’s sisters associated with a breach by the first defendant of her fiduciary obligations. Particular reference was made to Sheahan v Thompson (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 871 at [134]-[143] (reversed, on appeal, in Crossman v Sheahan [2016] NSWCA 200) as a point of entry into discussion of Barnes v Addy [1874] LR 9 Ch App 244, Farah Constructions Pty Limited v Say-Dee Pty Limited (2007) 230 CLR 89, and Simmons v NSW Trustee and Guardian [2014] NSWCA 405 and Grimaldi v Chameleon Mining NL (No. 2) (2012) 200 FCR 296.
	
	
	In Barnes v Addy (1874) LR 9 Ch App 244 at 251-252 Lord Selborne said:
	


“Those who create a trust clothe the trustee with a legal power and control over the trust property, imposing on him a corresponding responsibility. That responsibility may no doubt be extended in equity to others who are not properly trustees, if they are found either making themselves trustees de son tort, or actually participating in any fraudulent conduct of the trustee to the injury of the cestui que trust. But, on the other hand, strangers are not to be made constructive trustees merely because they act as the agents of trustees in transactions within their legal powers, transactions, perhaps of which a Court of Equity may disapprove, unless those agents receive and become chargeable with some part of the trust property, or unless they assist with knowledge in a dishonest and fraudulent design on the part of the trustees.”


	
	The rule in Barnes v Addy is conventionally treated as involving two forms of liability, respectively described as the “first limb” (involving a “knowing receipt” of trust property) and the “second limb” (involving “knowing assistance” in a dishonest and fraudulent design on the part of a trustee).
	
	
	Although the High Court of Australia, in Farah Constructions Pty Limited v Say-Dee Pty Limited (2007) 230 CLR 89 at 141 [113], left open the question whether the first limb of Barnes v Addy applies generally to persons dealing with some type of fiduciary other than a trustee, the Court of Appeal has accepted that it applies to fiduciaries (Simmons v NSW Trustee and Guardian [2014] NSWCA 405 at [86]-[92]) and, that being so, I am bound in these proceedings to do likewise.
	
	
	In Simmons v NSW Trustee and Guardian, at the identified paragraphs, Gleeson JA (with whom Beazley P and Barrett JA agreed) wrote as follows:
	


“86   In Farah at [112] the High Court defined the first limb of Barnes v Addy in this way:

""Persons who receive trust property become chargeable if it is established that they have received it with notice of the trust.""

87.The High Court also accepted, in the absence of any argument to the contrary, that a claim under the first limb of Barnes v Addy may be made against not only a trustee who misapplies trust property, but also a fiduciary who deals with property, in respect of which he or she owes fiduciary obligations, in breach of such obligations: Farah at [113].

88   The elements of a claim under the first limb of Barnes v Addy may be taken to be:

(1) the existence of a trust, or a fiduciary duty, with respect to property (trust property);

(2) the misapplication of trust property by the trustee or fiduciary;

(3) the receipt of trust property by the third party;

(4) knowledge by the third party, at the time he or she received the relevant property, that it was trust property and that it was being misapplied or, in the case of breach by a fiduciary, that the trust property was transferred pursuant to a breach of fiduciary duty.

89   The authorities which may be taken to establish element (4) above, include: Hancock Family Memorial Foundation Limited v Porteous [1999] WASC 55; 32 ACSR 124 at 142 (Anderson J); Spangaro v Corporate Investment Australia Funds Management Limited [2003] FCA 1025; 47 ACSR 285 at [55] (Finkelstein J); Grimaldi v Chameleon Mining NL (No 2) [2012] FCAFC 6; 200 FCR 296 at [20], [249]-[254]; Imobilari Pty Limited v Opes Prime Stockbroking Limited [2008] FCA 1920 at [15]; and Bell Group Limited (In Liq) v Westpac Banking Corporation (No 9) (Bell Group (No 9)) [2008] WASC 239; 70 ACSR 1 at [4748] (Owen J).

90   Although Farah did not consider the categories of knowledge sufficient to attract liability under element (4) of the first limb of Barnes v Addy, it may be accepted that the knowledge required is:

(1) actual knowledge of the trust, or the existence of the fiduciary duty, and of the misapplication of trust property or transfer pursuant of to a breach of fiduciary duty; or

(2) willfully shutting one's eyes to those things; or

(3) abstaining in a calculated way from making such inquiries, as an honest and reasonable person would make, about the trust and the application of the trust property; or

(4) knowledge of facts which to an honest and reasonable person would indicate the existence of the trust and the fact of misapplication.

91   The authorities which have accepted that the above categories of knowledge are sufficient include: Kalls Enterprises Pty Limited (in liq) v Balaglow [2007] NSWCA 191; 63 ACSR 557 at [176] (Giles JA; Ipp and Basten JJA agreeing); Hancock Family Memorial Foundation Limited v Porteous at 142; Grimaldi v Chameleon Mining NL (No 2) at [268]-[270]. See also Westpac Banking Corporation v Bell Group Limited (In Liq) (No 3) [2012] WASCA 157; 44 WAR 1 at [2130], when approving the view to which Owen J came at first instance in Bell Group Limited (No 9) at [4748].

92   On the other hand, those authorities also establish that mere knowledge of circumstances which would put an honest and reasonable person on inquiry is not sufficient to establish liability for knowing receipt.”


	
	Insofar as the plaintiff seeks, on behalf of the estate of the deceased, to establish against his sisters an entitlement based upon the first limb of Barnes v Addy (grounded in an allegation that the sisters received property of the deceased knowing that they did so as a consequence of the first defendant’s breach of fiduciary obligations owed to the deceased) an impediment to his success is that, in Farah Constructions Pty limited v Say-Dee Pty Limited (2007) 230 CLR 89 at 169-171, the High Court determined that mere notice of the fraud of another is insufficient to overcome the indefeasibility of title conferred on a registered proprietor by section 42.
	
	
	The plaintiff endeavours to overcome this obstacle by alleging that his sisters actively participated in their mother’s breach of fiduciary obligations. He contends that they had more than “mere” notice of their mother’s wrongdoing. On his case, they actively embraced it.
	
	
	In fairness to all parties, it should be noted that the case which the plaintiff seeks to make does not extend to an allegation that his sisters assisted their mother in a breach of her fiduciary obligations to the deceased “with knowledge in a dishonest and fraudulent design” on the part of the first defendant. That is, the plaintiff does not articulate a case based upon the second limb of Barnes v Addy.
	
	
	Principles within the penumbra of Barnes v Addy. Upon a review of the plaintiff’s statement of claim and the parties’ submissions generally, I notice the following observations in Jenyns v Public Curator (Queensland) (1953) 90 CLR 113 at 118-119:
	


“The jurisdiction of a court of equity to set aside a gift or other disposition of property as, actually or presumptively, resulting from undue influence, abuse of confidence or other circumstances affecting the conscience of the donee is governed by principals the application of which calls for a precise examination of the particular facts, a scrutiny of the exact relations established between the parties and a consideration of the mental capacities, processes and idiosyncrasies of the donor. Such cases do not depend upon legal categories susceptible of clear definition and giving rise to definite issues of fact readily formulated which, when found, automatically determine the validity of the disposition. Indeed no better illustration could be found of Lord Stowell’s generalisation concerning the administration of equity: ‘A court of law works its way to short issues, and confines its views to them. A court of equity takes a more comprehensive view, and looks to every connected circumstance that ought to influence its determination upon the real justice of the case’: The Juliana (1822) 2 Bods 504 at 522; 165 ER 1560 at 1567”.


	
	These observations were highlighted by Mahoney JA in Stivactas v Michaletos (No. 2) [1994] ANZ Conv R 252; (1993) Aust Contract R 90-031; (1993) NSW Conv R 55-683; BC 930 1874 when charged with untangling a case pleaded as involving “undue influence”.
	
	
	There is an affinity (although not a precise identity) between concepts such as “a breach of fiduciary obligations” and “an exercise of undue influence” upon a consideration of a relationship of influence between a stronger and a weaker party: Johnson v Buttress (1936) 56 CLR 113 at 134-135; Meagher Gummow and Lehane, Equity : Doctrines and Remedies (5th ed, Lexis Nexis Butterworths, Australia, 2015), paragraphs [15-100] – [15-105].
	
	
	The case for which the plaintiff contends has some resonance in the treatment of “undue influence” found in PW Young, C Croft and ML Smith, On Equity (Law Book Co, Sydney 2009) at paragraphs [5.450]-[5.470], here extracted (with editorial adaptation):
	


“Undue influence and third parties

[5.450]    In many cases, [an] impugned transfer is to the person exercising undue influence, but in some instances the transfer will be to a third party. A third party may also become involved when a person exerts undue influence over another, receives property as a result, and then transfers that property to another.

Generally speaking, a transfer of property procured by undue influence may be set aside as against a third party if the third party (a) is a volunteer [Bainbrigge v Browne (1881) 18 Ch D 188]; or (b) had notice of the undue influence [Bank of New South Wales v Rogers (1941) 65 CLR 42], or the circumstances giving rise to the undue influence. In each case, the third party’s receipt may be fixed with the consequences of the undue influence. A transfer may also be set aside as against a third party where the third party used the person who exercised undue influence over the grantor as an ‘agent’ or ‘intermediary’ to obtain the transfer [Giorgi v European Asian Bank AG (NSW Supreme Court, Young J, 21 February 1989, unreported)], although such cases are now considered to be extremely rare… If however the third party receives the property for value and with no notice, a plea of undue influence will not succeed against them: Bank of New South Wales v Rogers (1941) 65 CLR 42…

Transfers to third party volunteers

[5.460] Typically, a transfer to a third party volunteer occurs when a transfer of property is made to a relative or associate of the person who has exercised influence. Equity will not assist a volunteer, and so where this occurs the recipient will be fixed with the consequences of the other’s undue influence and the transfer may be set aside [Barron v Willis [1900] 2 Ch 121; Bridgeman v Green (1757) Wilm 58; 97 ER 22; Huguenin v Basley (1807) 14 Ves 273; 33 ER 526]. A transfer may also be set aside against a third party volunteer who received property jointly with the person who exercised undue influence: Quek v Beggs (1990) 5 BPR 11,761 (NSW SC).

Transfer to a third party with notice

[5.470] The most common situation in which a transfer to a third party without notice is found to occur is when the transferor provides security to a third party creditor for the debts of the person who has exercised undue influence. The third party will not be permitted to enforce the security if the creditor had actual or constructive notice of the circumstances giving rise to the exercise of undue influence. Where presumed undue influence has been shown, the knowledge constituting constructive notice will be knowledge of the facts or circumstances which would lead a court to find a presumption of undue influence: [Bank of New South Wales v Rogers (1941) 65 CLR 42; Broadlands International Finance Limited v Sly (1987) 4 BPR 9420 (NSW SC); Giorgi v European Asian Bank AG (unreported, NSW SC, 21 February 1989); and Contractors Funding Limited v Snee [1922] 2 NZLR 157]. Where actual undue influence has been established, the relevant notice will be of the circumstances alleged to constitute the actual undue influence [Bank of Credit & Commerce International SA v Aboody [1990] 1 QB 923 (CA)]. Where a transaction is so “extravagantly improvident” that it is difficult to explain in the absence of some impropriety, then a third party may be put on inquiry by this factor alone: Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland NV v Burch [1997] 1 All ER 144; (1996) 74 P & CR 384 (CA).

If the third party knows enough of the circumstances to put it on inquiry, but fails to make reasonable inquiries or to take other reasonable steps to ascertain whether the surety has an equity to have the transaction set aside, it will be held to have constructive notice: Bank of New South Wales v Rogers (1941) 65 CLR 42. [See also Micarone v Perpetual Trustees [1999] SASC 265 (FC); Barclays Bank plc v O’Brien [1994] 1 AC 180 (HL)].


	
	In the unreported judgment of Giorgi v European Asian Bank AG referred to in On Equity, Young J cited the second (1984) edition of Meagher, Gummow & Lehane, Equity : Doctrines and Remedies, paragraph [1529]; Turnbull v Duval [1902] AC 429; Bainbridge v Browne (1881) 18 Ch D 188 at 197 and Bank of New South Wales v Rogers (1941) 65 CLR 41 at 51 and 70.
	
	
	The equivalent passage in the 5th (2015) edition of Meagher, Gummow and Lehane is found in paragraph [15-150], which includes the following observations (omitting footnotes) :
	


“Third parties

[15-150] The equitable doctrine [of undue influence] extends to cases where the party exerting the undue influence was not the direct recipient of the disponor’s property. It extends to set aside transactions involving third parties in the following capacities: (a) where Y under the influence of X disposes of property to Z, it does not appear necessary that the third party Z act in concert with X provided, presumably, Z is not a purchaser from Y without notice of X’s influence; (b) where Y under the influence of X enters into obligations to Z which will be to the benefit of X, for example, where Y guarantees the bank overdraft of X or enters into a service contract with Z, and (c) cases where Z acquires property from X and, as against X, Y could have reclaimed the property; it would appear that Y’s rights will persist against all but a bona fide purchaser for value without notice and those claiming under Y, and further that Y’s rights are assignable and devisable.”


	
	Young J disposed of the case before him in the following manner:
	


“In the instant case, the evidence falls short of showing that the [defendant] bank used a fiduciary agent, namely, the mother [of the plaintiff], in getting the plaintiff to sign the mortgage. There is also no evidence to show that there was any acting in concert between the plaintiff’s mother and the bank. However, it would seem to me that this is a case where the bank knew of the circumstances which would give rise to the presumption of undue influence. The bank knew that the plaintiff was the daughter of one of the principal borrowers. The bank knew that the plaintiff was a student. The bank had no reason to suspect that there was any legal advice given to the plaintiff separate from the legal advice that was given to her mother. Accordingly, unless it can be shown that the daughter was emancipated, the facts which were in everyone’s knowledge were the classic facts of a presumed relationship of influence. When one has those facts matched with a transaction in which a daughter parts with her property otherwise than for full value, one gets the situation where the court, unless some other factors are demonstrated by the person taking the benefit, will set aside the transaction….

I do not think it matters at all that the bank thought that this was a normal transaction or that the bank believed what it was told by Mrs Giorgi [the mother], that the proper was either one of her properties or was somehow or other one over which she had control or that the bank accepted what was said by the various solicitors, that they were acting for the plaintiff as well as for [the mother…]. The bank had the facts to show that this was one of the classic situations of undue influence, that is, a daughter parting with her property at a gross under-value for the benefit of her mother.”


	
	Similar principles about conferral of a benefit on a third party underlie treatment of a fiduciary’s powers in the context of a transfer of property to the third party (a non-beneficiary) in breach of a fiduciary obligation. Witness Finn’s Fiduciary Obligations (2016 reprint), paragraph [107]:
	


“Benefits to Third Persons

If a discretion is exercised with the sole or principal purpose in mind of benefiting a non-beneficiary, it will be wholly improper – unless in all the circumstances the fiduciary could, and did, reasonably believe that by acting in that person’s interests he was thereby furthering his beneficiaries’ interests. Thus in Sutherland v Sutherland [1893] 3 Ch 169 where a tenant for life used his leasing power to provide his wife with a house and lands on the settlement property with the manifest intention of providing for her after his death, the leases were set aside. They had been granted not for the benefit of the estate, but solely for the wife’s benefit. [See also In re Hunt’s Settled Estates, Bulteel v Lawdeshayne [1905] 2 Ch 418; [1906] 2 Ch 11, a case of fraudulent collusion with a third person]. By way of contrast in Re Clifford [1948] SASR 83 where trustees holding shares in a company proposed to vote at a company meeting in favour of a resolution to make redundancy payments to certain employees when the company changed the nature of its business, the Court held that, in the circumstances, this gratuitous payment could still be for the benefit of the cestuis que trust.”


	
	The following extracts from the judgment of Romer J in Dowager Duchess of Sutherland v Duke of Sutherland [1893] 3 Ch 169 at 187 and 193-194 illustrate the broad similarity between a breach of fiduciary obligations case and an undue influence case bearing upon the question whether a transfer of property to a third party might be set aside:
	


“In my judgment, the leases, the subject of this action, cannot stand. I come to this conclusion on the broad ground that the late Duke, in granting them in exercise of his powers as tenant for life of the settled property (the Trentham estate), did not have regard to the interests of all parties entitled under the settlement, and acted in breach of the obligations which were cast upon him by sect. 53 of the Settled Land Act, 1882 – that in relation to the exercise of his powers he should be deemed to be in the position and to have the duties and liabilities of a trustee for those parties. In my judgment, those leases were not granted by the late Duke in the bona fide exercise of his leasing powers for the benefit of the settled estate, but were granted for the purpose of conferring, as they did confer, a benefit upon his wife, the Plaintiff, at the expense or to the serious injury of those who were to come after him, under the settlement, in the enjoyment of the estate….

For these reasons, I think the leases cannot be supported, and I need scarcely observe that under the circumstances the Plaintiff cannot be regarded as ‘a person dealing in good faith with a tenant for life,’ within the meaning, and so as to obtain the benefit of, the provisions of sect. 54 of the Settled Land Act, 1882. She was not called as a witness before me, and was a party to the selection of the building site, and was, as I gather, party and privy to all circumstances of the transaction which I have remarked upon, and, indeed, it appears from her affidavit made upon the motion in the action that she was aware of the real object and intent of the leases.”


	
	These, and similar, observations are brought to attention in the context of a reminder by the High Court, in Farah Constructions Pty Limited v Say-Dee Pty Limited (2007) 230 CLR 89 at [161], that what was said by Lord Selborne in Barnes v Addy (1874) LR 9 Ch App 244 at 251-252 concerning “knowing assistance” was not an exhaustive statement of the circumstances in which, and the bases upon which, a third party’s participation in and another’s breach of trust (or a breach of fiduciary duty) could render that person accountable in equity.
	
	
	The High Court noted that, before Barnes v Addy, “there was a line of cases which accepted that a third party might be treated as a participant in breach of trust where the third party had knowingly induced or immediately procured breaches of duty by a trustee where the trustee had acted with no improper purpose; these were not cases of a third party assisting the trustee in any dishonest or fraudulent design on the part of the trustee.”
	
	
	That point was elaborated by the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia (including Finn J) in Grimaldi v Chameleon Mining N L and Anor (No. 2) (2012) 200 FCR 296 at [242]-[247] and in a subsequent paper of WMC Gummow, “Knowing Assistance” (2013) 87 ALJ 311.
	
	
	The Full Federal Court wrote as follows:
	


“(i) Third Party Liability: A Digression

242 It is accepted in this country that Lord Selborne’s ex tempore observations in Barnes v Addy did not provide an exhaustive statement of the circumstances in which, and the bases on which, a third party’s participation in another’s breach of fiduciary duty or breach of trust, could render that person accountable in equity as a “constructive trustee” (to use the commonly adopted but often unhelpful formula): Farah Constructions at [161].

243 The fact findings made in this case reveal, potentially, four quite different manifestations of such participation. Each type warrants present note. The first, is where the third party is the corporate creature, vehicle, or alter ego of wrongdoing fiduciaries who use it to secure the profits of, or to inflict the losses by, their breach of fiduciary duty: see eg Cook v Deeks [1916] AC 554 (“Cook”) at 565; Queensland Mines Limited v Hudson (1975-1976) ACLC 28, 658 at 27,709, revsd on other grounds (1978) 18 ALR 1; Timber Engineering Co Pty Limited v Anderson [1980] 2 NSWLR 488 (“Timber Engineering”) at [11]; Green & Clara Pty Limited v Bestobell Industries Pty Limited (No 2) [1984] WAR 32 (“Green v Bestobell”); Gencor ACP Limited v Dalby [2000] 2 BCLC 734 at [26]; CMS Dolphin Limited v Simonet [2001] 2 BCLC 704 (“CMS Dolphin”) at [97]-[105]. In these cases the corporate vehicle is fully liable for the profits made from, and the losses inflicted by, the fiduciary’s wrong. The liability itself is explained commonly on the basis that “company had full knowledge of all of the facts”: Cook, at 565; it is the alter ego of the fiduciary with a “transmitted fiduciary obligation”: Timber Engineering at [11]; or that it “jointly participated” in the breach: CMS Dolphin at [103]. Liability does not turn on the need to show “dishonesty”, although it often provides the reason for the interposition of the company. Proof of a breach of fiduciary duty will suffice; Green v Bestobell at 40. And, as was said in CMS Dolphin (at [104]), it is “rather artificial” to use Barnes v Addy to explain this liability.

244 The second is where an agent of a company (often a director) has knowledge of fiduciary or trust wrongdoing (be it his or her own or a third party’s) which can be imputed to the company, the wrongdoing itself affecting a transaction or dealing involving the company: see eg John v Dodwell & Co [1918] AC 563 at 569. Though the liability of the corporation here results from the imputation to it of knowledge of wrongdoing, the corporation’s own wrong for which it is held accountable is characteristically under one or other of the two limbs of Barnes v Addy. We refer later to the limits to the imputation of knowledge and, when considering relief, to the nature of the liability imposed in such cases.

245 The third is where the third party knowingly induces or procures a breach of trust or breach of fiduciary duty whether for his or her own, or for another person’s, benefit. As with corporate alter ego cases, it is not necessary to show any dishonest or fraudulent design here: see Elders Trustee and Executor Co Pty Limited v E G Reeves Pty Limited (1987) 78 ALR 193 at 238-239; Farah Constructions, at [161]; and see generally Harpum, “The Stranger as Constructive Trustee” (1986) 102 LQR 114 at 141-144.

246 The fourth is where the third party deals with a known agent (or fiduciary) in a projected transaction with the agent’s principal (or beneficiary) and in the course of so dealing offers and has accepted, or agrees to the agent’s solicitation of, a commission, introduction fee or other collateral benefit without the informed consent of the principal. In such a case the third party’s liability is founded on the assumption of the risk that the agent has not obtained the informed consent of the principal to the receipt of such a benefit and hence is acting in breach of fiduciary duty: see Grant v Gold Exploration and Development Syndicate at 249; Daraydan Holdings, at [53]; and, above, “Bribes and Secret Commissions”.

247 What the above appears to illustrate is that participatory liability as it evolved in equity in cases prior and subsequent to Barnes v Addy was not based on inflexible formulae. Given the variety of circumstances in which, and bases on which, a third party could be characterised as a wrongdoer in equity – and we have not here referred as well to third party participation, for example, in a breach of confidence or the abuse of a relationship of influence: see eg Bank of New South Wales v Rogers (1941) 65 CLR 42 – varying importance has been given to three matters: (i) the nature of the actual fiduciary or trustee wrongdoing in which the third party was a participant; (ii) the nature of the third party’s role and participation, eg as alter ago, inducer or procurer, dealer at arm’s length, etc; and (iii) the extent of the participant’s knowledge or, assumption of the risk of, or indifference to, actual, apprehended or suspected wrongdoing by the fiduciary.”


	
	Professor Gummow concluded his paper with the following observations, at 87 ALJ 319:
	


“The better view of all species of accessorial or participatory liability is that they are not based upon inflexible formulae, nor are they parasitic upon pre-existing property rights. Rather, the liability is ‘fault-based’, in the sense of responding to what in the eye of a court of equity is unconscientious conduct. The participation of the third party may be presented by a range of circumstances; these may include activity as a participant, inducer or procurer. The morally obtuse, as elsewhere in the law, are not excused, but the rigours of constructive notice do not operate here.”


	
	Reference should also be made to the judgment of the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia (including Edelman J) in Great Investments Limited v Warner (2006) 243 FCR 516 at [52]-[55], where the Court made the following observations:
	


“Legal principles concerning liability of recipients of company assets.

The concession

52.   Much of the trial, and some of this appeal, was devoted to submissions by the parties about liability based upon “knowing receipt” of property transferred in breach of fiduciary duty. However, during the course of the appeal, senior counsel for the appellant properly conceded that if the transfer was without authority (including statutory deeming of authority under ss 128 and 129 of the Corporations Act) then questions of knowing receipt would not apply; the appellants could only succeed on the appeal if they could establish that they were bona fide purchasers for value without notice (ts 25). Conversely,… if the transfers were made with authority then the question would be whether the transfers could be rescinded. Again, issues of knowing receipt would not arise.

53.   … [We] accept the concession that the doctrine of knowing receipt is unnecessary where a company seeks only to recover rights, or their value, transferred without authority to a recipient. The position would be different if the company sought to recover consequential losses as equitable compensation or, in the alternative, to obtain an account and disgorgement of a recipient’s profits. An action for knowing receipt would be needed for those remedies: Grimaldi v Chameleon Mining NL (No 2) [2012] FCAFC 6; (2012) 200 FCR 296, 359 [253] (the Court).

54.   One obstacle to this conclusion is a potential argument that recognition (subject to defences) of a strict liability claim against a recipient, without authority, of company assets would “outflank” the liability in Barnes v Addy. In Fistar v Riverwood Legion and Community Club Limited [2016] NSWCA 81, the New South Wales Court of Appeal considered this submission which asserted that strict liability would be inconsistent with the decision of the High Court of Australia in Farah Constructions Pty Limited v Say-Dee Pty Limited [2007] HCA 22; (2007) 230 CLR 89. In Farah Constructions v Say-Dee, the High Court said at 151 [134] that:

… If, on the other hand, the Court of Appeal is to be treated not as abandoning the notice test for the first limb of Barnes v Addy, but rather as recognising a new and additional avenue of relief, it is an avenue which tends to render the first limb otiose. That too is not a step which an intermediate court of appeal should take in the face of long-established authority and seriously considered dicta of a majority of this Court.

55.   In a close examination of the reasoning of the High Court, both Leeming JA and Sackville AJA explained in Fistar that the High Court was not denying, by this passage, the existence of concurrent liability, including strict liability, based upon different principles. We respectfully agree with all their Honours’ observations on this point. In particular, as Leeming JA observed (Bathurst CJ agreeing), the High Court could not have been rejecting the numerous well recognised claims of strict liability, subject to defences, which exist alongside Barnes v Addy. One of those is the strict liability trust imposed upon the recipient of stolen property. A second example is the liability imposed upon a subsequent dealing by a recipient of trust property which also creates the obligation of trusteeship. A third example is a claim for specific restitution of a chattel: McKeown v Cavalier Yachts Pty Limited (1988) 13 NSWLR 303, 307-308. A fourth example is an equitable proprietary claim based upon a better equitable title. Even closer to the present circumstances, another instance that could be added to the examples given by Leeming JA is the power of a trustee (or replacement trustee) to rescind a transfer to a third party which was made within power but in breach of fiduciary duty: Pitt v Holt [2013] UKSC 26; [2013] 2 AC 108, 131-132 [43] (Lord Walker with whom Lord Neuberger, Baroness Hale, Lord Mance, Lord Clarke, Lord Sumption and Lord Carnwath agreed). It has even been argued that the adjective “fiduciary” should be removed due to the breadth and liberality in the concept of a “fiduciary” duty used here by the Supreme Court: Ashdown M, Trustee Decision Making: The Rule in Re Hastings-Bass (Oxford University Press, 2015) 63-67 [4.04]-[4.07].”


	
	The pleaded case of the plaintiff. In his statement of claim the plaintiff pleads against his sisters, inter alia, allegations to the following effect:
	



	
	On or about 2 December 2009 the sisters became the registered proprietors of “Boronga” when that property was transferred to them by the first defendant purporting to act as attorney for the deceased and by the sixth defendant then acting as solicitor for all parties to the transfer (S/C 3(b)).
	
	
	On or about 2 December 2009 the defendants and each of them, acting in unison, procured the transfer of “Boronga” unto the sisters (S/C 26).
	
	
	Between the year 2007 and 22 December 2012, the deceased having lost the capacity to manage his own affairs, the first defendant, acting as his attorney, was under a general fiduciary duty: (i) not to deal with the assets of the deceased in any manner, save and except for his exclusive benefit; (ii) not to deprive the deceased of his assets; (iii) not to gift the deceased’s assets to any person; (iv) not to deal with the deceased’s assets in any way which would defeat his testamentary intentions; and (v) to procure for the deceased the full market value of any asset of his which the first defendant sold or transferred (S/C 32).
	
	
	Between July and December 2009 the defendants and each of them knew or ought to have known that the deceased’s testamentary intention was that, upon his death, “Boronga” should pass in an unencumbered estate unto the plaintiff (S/C 37).
	
	
	In consequence of that fact, the defendants and each of them knew or should have known or foreseen that the plaintiff was a person who was vulnerable to economic loss and damage in the event that any act or thing was done by them which would defeat the deceased’s testamentary intentions (S/C 38).
	
	
	At all material times the plaintiff’s sisters, by themselves and/or by their servant and/or agent the sixth defendant, knew or should have known that the first defendant in her capacity as an attorney for the deceased, had no power to make an improvident transfer of “Boronga” unto the sisters (S/C 40).
	
	
	At all material times the sisters and each of them knew or should have known that they were not entitled to participate with the first defendant in an improvident transfer of “Boronga” to them (S/C 41).
	
	
	At all material times the defendants and each of them knew or ought to have known that an improvident transfer of “Boronga” by the first defendant, purporting to act as attorney for the deceased, to the plaintiff’s sisters was a void or voidable transaction (S/C 42).
	
	
	In these circumstances, at all material times the defendants and each of them were under duties not to participate in an improvident transfer of “Boronga” and/or in any conduct which would defeat the deceased’s testamentary intentions (S/C 43).
	
	
	Acting in excess of the powers conferred by the deceased’s power of attorney, acting in breach of her fiduciary duties and acting in breach of her duties of care, on or about 2 December 2009 the first defendant procured the transfer of “Boronga” unto the plaintiff’s sisters without procuring for the deceased the payment of “Boronga’s” market value from the transferees (S/C 52).
	
	
	In the circumstances pleaded in the statement of claim, at all material times between the improvident transfer of “Boronga” to them and the date of the deceased’s death, “Boronga” was an ‘ill-gotten gain’ in the hands of the plaintiff’s sisters and, in consequence, they held “Boronga” upon trust for the deceased, and each of them was then under a fiduciary duty to reconvey “Boronga” unto the deceased (S/C 35).
	
	
	In the circumstances pleaded in the statement of claim, at all times after the deceased’s death on 22 December 2012 “Boronga” was an ‘ill-gotten gain’ in the hands of the plaintiff’s sisters and, in consequence, they held “Boronga” upon trust for the deceased’s estate, and each of them was thereafter under a duty to reconvey “Boronga” unto the deceased’s estate (S/C 36).
	



	
	The allegation in paragraph 26 of the statement of claim that the defendants, “acting in unison”, procured the transfer of “Boronga” to the plaintiff’s sisters was particularised as follows:
	



	
	The sixth defendant, acting as solicitor for the defendants and/or each of them, prepared an instrument of Transfer whereby “Boronga” would be transferred to the plaintiff’s sisters;
	
	
	The sixth defendant procured the first defendant and the fourth defendant to execute the instrument of transfer;
	
	
	The sixth defendant forwarded the instrument of Transfer to the second, third and fifth defendants for execution by them;
	
	
	Each of the plaintiff’s sisters executed the instrument of Transfer;
	
	
	The first defendant and the sixth defendant, without first obtaining the plaintiff’s consent, registered in the office of the Registrar General the deceased’s power of attorney in order to facilitate registration of the instrument of Transfer;
	
	
	The sixth defendant procured the recording upon the real property register of the transfer of “Boronga” to the plaintiff’s sisters; and
	
	
	In consequence of these particularised matters, “Boronga”, which then had a market value of approximately $1.2 million, was transferred by the first and sixth defendants to the plaintiff’s sisters, as joint tenants, for a nominal consideration of $1.00 passing from the transferees unto the deceased.
	



	
	Leaving aside a generic claim for “damages”, the statement of claim materially claims the relief to the following effect:
	



	
	a declaration that the transfer of “Boronga” on 2 December 2009 to the plaintiff’s sisters was void (Prayer 7).
	
	
	a declaration that the property known as “Boronga” is held by the plaintiff’s sisters upon trust for the estate of the deceased (Prayer 8).
	
	
	an order that the plaintiff’s sisters transfer “Boronga” unto the executor or administrator of the estate of the deceased (Prayer 9).
	



	
	The Role of the Sixth Defendant. An important, if not critical allegation by the plaintiff in the statement of claim is that the sixth defendant acted as solicitor for “all parties” to the transfer of “Boronga”.
	
	
	The importance of that allegation is that, whatever might have been the subjective state of knowledge of each of the plaintiff’s sisters, the sixth defendant (by the employed solicitor, Mr Maccallum, who had carriage of the transfer), from 6 May 2009 or thereabouts, had physical possession of both the power of attorney and the will of the deceased.
	
	
	At some point at which the will was in the possession of the sixth defendant’s firm it bore, in the handwriting of a person unknown, the pencilled name of the plaintiff against clause 3 of the will, highlighting (if it was not otherwise apparent) the possibility that the plaintiff was the deceased’s intended beneficiary of “Boronga”. The provenance and timing of that pencilled note are too speculative to be given significant weight; but the note underscores an observation, independent of its terms, that the name of the plaintiff readily comes to mind on reading clause 3 in the context of the will as a whole, informed by knowledge of the composition of the deceased’s family.
	
	
	The plaintiff invites the Court to impute to the first defendant and his sisters knowledge of the solicitor. The defendants warn the Court against assessing knowledge of the plaintiff’s sisters by aggregating knowledge of the solicitor and the sisters, each possibly unaware of impropriety, to create a notional person with dishonest intent then attributed to the sisters: Macquarie Bank Limited v Sixty-Fourth Throne Pty Limited ‘1998] 3 VR 133 at 135-136 and 151-157. That warning counsels caution about any vicarious attribution of knowledge. However, it does not displace a need, inherent in agency law, to accommodate the rights of third parties dealing with a principal through an agent where knowledge is divided between principal and agent: SJ Stojar, The Law of Agency: Its History and Present Principles (London, 1961), page 83.
	
	
	The law’s solution, broadly, is to impute knowledge of an agent to the principal in cases in which the agent has actual knowledge of a fact, that knowledge is material to performance of work the agent was retained to perform, and the knowledge is of a character which the agent is bound to inform the principal in performance of that work: Sargent v ASL Developments Pty Limited (1974) 131 CLR 634 at 658-659; Ford Excavations Pty Limited v Do Carmo [1981] 2 NSWLR 253 at 266-267; Wyllie v Pollen (1863) 3 De GJ & S 596 at 601; 46 ER 767 at 770.
	
	
	The sixth defendant himself, personally, played no substantial role in the transaction of business, having delegated it to Mr Maccallum. There is no denial by the sixth defendant of Mr Maccallum’s authority to perform the work delegated to him. Unqualified references hereafter to the sixth defendant can be taken to refer to the sixth defendant acting through Mr McCallum as his duly authorised servant or agent.
	
	
	Mr Maccallum says that, at all times, he considered the first defendant to be his client and that the fifth defendant was assisting her. More probably, he did not really turn his mind to the identity of his client, or clients, in any critical fashion. Incidental statements made by him in correspondence suggest that, without critical analysis or reflection, he regarded the sixth defendant’s firm as simply acting for “the [Reilly] family”.
	
	
	Identification of a solicitor’s “client” can, and in these proceedings does, involve layers of complexity. Care needs to be taken not to be captured by a label (“client”) capable of obscuring a correct understanding of relationships underlying use of the label.
	
	
	The sixth defendant had no personal contact with the deceased, whose mental incapacity precluded any personal conduct of business. Mr Maccallum took his core instructions from the first defendant who, purporting to act as attorney for the deceased, advanced her own interests and those of her daughters in disregard of the interests of the deceased, her putative principal.
	
	
	Mr Maccallum’s failure to test his instructions in a critical examination of the identity of his firm’s “client” lies at the heart of the present proceedings. By acting for the first defendant in two capacities (one personal, the other representative), as he did, without confronting an inherent ambiguity in her instructions, Mr Maccallum exposed the defendants to the dangers of fiduciary business tainted by conflicts of duty and interest.
	
	
	In the transfer of “Boronga” out of the name of the deceased and into the names of his daughters, on the putative authority of the first defendant as attorney for the deceased, and to the detriment of the plaintiff without full engagement with him in any capacity (either personally or as an attorney for the deceased), the sixth defendant did not act, in fact, for either the deceased or the plaintiff. This was so notwithstanding that he purported to act for the deceased (through the first defendant) and he had personal contact with the plaintiff, limited to clarifying information about the size of “Boronga” and sending out the partnership deed for the “Shadrack Partnership” for execution.
	
	
	The sixth defendant may have owed each of the deceased and the plaintiff a duty of care in tort (as is later to be considered) but, the parties agree, he did not have a contractual relationship with either of them.
	
	
	The first defendant disclosed to the sixth defendant that she was purporting to act as attorney for the deceased, sufficient of itself, one might have thought, to establish a contractual relationship between the deceased and the sixth defendant. However, the parties agree otherwise.
	
	
	The sixth defendant (through his employee Mr Maccallum) held the deceased’s power of attorney in his possession; he knew that the deceased lacked the mental capacity to confer additional authority on the first defendant; and he ought to have appreciated that the first defendant had no authority (actual or ostensible) to do what she sought to do in the name of the deceased. He had, at least, a duty (which he did not adequately perform) to clarify the terms of his instructions vis-a-vis the deceased and, arguably, the plaintiff: cf, Hallani v Hallani [2013] NSWSC 91, citing Geoffrey W Hill & Associates (Insurance Brokers) Pty Limited v Squash Centre (Allawah North) Pty Limited (1990) 6 ANZ Insurance Cases 61-012.
	
	
	There is in the evidence no written form of “costs agreement” pursuant to which the sixth defendant was retained, although, by way of an exchange of correspondence on 22 April 2009, the sixth defendant provided a cost estimate to the fifth defendant and she instructed him that the first defendant was happy to proceed on the basis of that estimate. The work contemplated by the retainer thus confirmed was described generally as “estate planning”, incorporating the transfer of “Boronga”, a potential transfer of other investments of the deceased and the first defendant, and the preparation of two partnership agreements. The first and fifth defendants held out to the sixth defendant (via his employee) that they would were instructing him on behalf of the Reilly family but, in relation to the transfer of “Boronga”, they were doing so only on behalf of themselves and the second, third and fourth defendants.
	
	
	In the contract of sale of land (dated 1 July 2009) prepared by the sixth defendant as an integral part of the documentation leading to transfer of “Boronga” to the plaintiff’s sisters, the sixth defendant’s firm was named as solicitor for the “vendor” (the deceased, purportedly represented by the first defendant as his attorney) and as solicitor for the “purchasers” (the plaintiff’s sisters). The firm acted on both sides of the conveyancing transaction from go to whoa. They attended to the provision of advice to each of the parties to the transaction (excluding the deceased, with whom they had no personal contact); to the preparation of the contract, the memorandum of transfer and applications by the purchasers for a stamp duty exemption; to the issue of replacement title deeds when those held by the deceased could not be located; to registration of the memorandum of transfer; and to the service of “notice of sale” on government authorities.
	
	
	Factual Findings and Analysis. In substance, the allegations of fact made by the plaintiff in the statement of claim against his sisters have been made out by the evidence.
	
	
	I do not intend, by this observation, to adopt the plaintiff’s colourisation of the facts in contentions that his mother and sisters owed him a duty of care, and that his mother was necessarily bound as an attorney to give effect to the deceased’s testamentary intentions. I do not intend, by an acceptance that underlying facts have been proved, to lose sight of a need for independent legal analysis of the facts proved.
	
	
	Between 16 April 2009 and 5 February 2010 or thereabouts the sixth defendant (through his employee, Mr Maccallum) acted for “the family” in advising upon and implementing arrangements for a transfer of “Boronga” from the name of the deceased to the names of his daughters.
	
	
	Mr Maccallum first conferred with the first and fifth defendants on 16 April 2009, following a preliminary inquiry as to his availability made by the fourth defendant through a member of his staff.
	
	
	In the course of the conveyancing transaction, Mr Maccallum had direct personal contact with each of the first, third, fourth and fifth defendants but not, it seems, the second defendant.
	
	
	Nevertheless, the second defendant did receive from the sixth defendant’s firm correspondence inviting confirmation of her instructions. The solicitor’s letter dated 12 June 2009 recorded that, on instructions from the first and fifth defendants, they provided to her the contract, the transfer, a stamp duty exemption application form, the Boronga Partnership Deed and the Shadrack Partnership Deed. The letter made a request of her in the following terms:
	


“Please check through the documents, make note of any matters for query and contact the writer [the sixth defendant’s employee] by phone to confirm your instructions.”


	
	The second defendant executed and returned the documents without a confirmatory phone call.
	
	
	The fact that the second, third and fourth defendants were content to leave most contact with the solicitors to the first defendant and, more often, the fifth defendant does not detract from the fact that they were clients of the solicitors. Nor does the fact that the sixth defendant’s account (dated 10 February 2010) was addressed to the first defendant, with a stated expectation that the fifth defendant would attend to payment.
	
	
	Incidentally, the documentation provided to the plaintiff on or about 12 June 2009 was limited to a copy of the Shadrack Partnership Deed. The solicitor’s letter addressed to the plaintiff simply recorded:
	


“On instructions from your mother [the first defendant] and sister Tish [the fifth defendant] we have prepared the enclosed form of partnership agreement. Please check through the document and contact the writer [the sixth defendant’s employee] to confirm your instructions.”


	
	The solicitors did not seek from the plaintiff, and he did not give to them, instructions concerning the transfer of “Boronga” out of the name of the deceased.
	
	
	The plaintiff signed the Shadrack Partnership Deed at the request of the first defendant, and she witnessed his signature and caused it to be returned to the solicitors, thereby minimising his role.
	
	
	Although the contract and memorandum of transfer each bear the date 1 July 2009, both documents were prepared and signed in June 2009. The date 1 July 2009 was inserted at the suggestion of the first defendant’s (the Reilly family’s) accountant.
	
	
	When they signed the memorandum of transfer, the signatures of each of the third and fifth defendants was dated 24 June 2009.
	
	
	At or about the time they signed the contract and the memorandum of transfer, each of the plaintiff’s sisters made a statutory declaration in support of an application for stamp duty exemption (granted on 13 August 2009). The second defendant’s declaration was made on 26 June 2009. The third defendant’s on 24 June 2009. The fourth defendant’s on a date in June 2009 not legible on the document in evidence, but apparently the 11th, the date upon which Mr Maccallum deposes to having given advice to the fourth defendant and witnessed her signature on documentation as she was heading overseas for a time. The fifth defendant’s declaration was made on 25 June 2009.
	
	
	Each declaration identified the deceased as the transferor of “Boronga”, deposed to the deceased’s use of the property for the business of primary production and declared an intention to continue such a business after transfer of the property.
	
	
	Mr Maccallum witnessed execution of the memorandum of transfer by each of the first and fourth defendants. He also, by telephone (on 16 June 2009), had a conversation with the third defendant in which, he says, he explained to her the documents to be signed by her “and her responsibilities”.
	
	
	Each of the plaintiff’s sisters signed the memorandum of transfer on a separate page, facilitating their execution of the document otherwise than at the same time and place. Nevertheless, each page bore a sequential number that tied it to the first page, upon which were plainly recorded the fact that the deceased, as transferor, purportedly signed the document by the first defendant as his attorney.
	
	
	The registration number of the power of attorney did not appear on the document at the time of execution of the memorandum of transfer because the power of attorney was not sent by the sixth defendant for registration until 3 July 2009, and it was not registered until 6 July 2009.
	
	
	The fact of the deceased’s mental incapacity throughout the time that the sixth defendant acted on the transfer of “Boronga” (between 16 April 2009 and 10 February 2010 or thereabouts) was known by all the defendants, no less than it was known by the plaintiff.
	
	
	Mr Maccallum deposed that, in his initial conference with the first and fifth defendants on 16 April 2009, he was expressly told that the deceased was then “off the air”, as a consequence of which his power of attorney was to be acted upon.
	
	
	In an email exchange between Mr Maccallum and the fifth defendant on 23 April 2009, it was confirmed that the deceased then lacked the capacity to make a will. On 23 November 2009 the first defendant made a statutory declaration (in support of an application to the Registrar General for replacement certificates of title) in which she deposed to an inability to locate the title deeds sought to be replaced. She deposed: “My husband no longer has the mental capacity to advise where the [lost certificate of title] Deeds are located. I have made a thorough search of his files and records. There is no record of them ever being held by his bank and they are not held by any solicitors in the district.”
	
	
	Mr Maccallum had the deceased’s power of attorney and will in his physical possession no later than about 6 May 2009. He read them when he received them. His recollection is that, at that time, he thought the will was irrelevant for reasons which included the first defendant’s possession of a power of attorney, the fact that he was acting on an inter vivos transaction, the fact that “Malaya” had been transferred to the plaintiff in his name alone, and the fact (as the solicitor understood it) that “the family” had agreed that “Boronga” should be transferred to the girls.
	
	
	Even if (which I doubt) the first to fifth defendants did not see a copy of the deceased’s will in 2009, and even if (which I also doubt) the second to fifth defendants did not see a copy of the deceased’s power of attorney at that time, the sixth defendant’s knowledge (through Mr Maccallum) of the nature and terms of those documents must be imputed to each of the first to fifth defendants vis-a-vis the deceased and the plaintiff.
	
	
	The sixth defendant (through Mr Maccallum) had actual knowledge of the terms of the power of attorney and the will. Those terms were material to performance of the work which the sixth defendant was retained to do. His HhIMr Maccallum actively sought production of both the power of attorney and the will in order that he might perform the firm’s retainer, the essential character of which (as he understood it) focussed upon an “intergenerational transfer” of property out of the name of the deceased, in recognition of the deceased’s present mental incapacity and in anticipation of the deceased’s death. Mr Maccallum, was bound to inform his clients of his knowledge of them.
	
	
	The will bore directly upon any attribution of an “estate planning” intention to the deceased, and upon an assessment of what the deceased might regard as beneficial to himself in the context of his family. Even in its unrectified form, the will was suggestive of an intention of the part of the deceased both to involve his son in administration of his estate and to withhold “Boronga” from his daughters. The defective form of clause 3 of the will invited a clarification of instructions as to the deceased’s true testamentary intentions.
	
	
	Such an invitation was reinforced by the form of the deceased’s power of attorney, which conferred upon the plaintiff a standing (as joint and several attorney) equal to that of the first defendant. Given that the first defendant purported to act on behalf of the deceased and that, as an attorney for the deceased, it was trite law that she was likely to owe fiduciary obligations to the deceased, breach of which could expose her and others to litigation by or on behalf of the deceased, the sixth defendant, through his employee, was bound, in the performance of the firm’s retainer, to ensure that “the Reilly family” (for whom Mr McCallum understood he acted) – an expression which must be taken at least to have embraced the first defendant and her daughters – were aware of the terms of the will and power of attorney. His knowledge is to be imputed to each of the first defendant and her daughters.
	
	
	That knowledge is inconsistent with any entitlement the plaintiff’s sisters might otherwise have had to rely upon a representation of authority by the first defendant (and there was no holding out by the deceased able to be relied upon, independently of the power of attorney) sufficient to ground an ostensible or apparent authority in the first defendant to do what she did in effecting a transfer of “Boronga” out of the name of the deceased.
	
	
	The plaintiff made no representation to his sisters that their mother was authorised to effect a transfer even if (contrary to my findings) he were to be taken to have acquiesced in her determination to transfer the property to them. Had they thought otherwise, they might reasonably be expected to have engaged him more in the transfer process. As it was, they marginalised him in a manner, and to an extent, that confirms that they did not rely upon anything emanating from him about the nature and scope of their mother’s authority. They relied simply upon the first defendant’s possession of a power of attorney and her determination to favour them.
	
	
	That determination extended beyond a transfer of “Boronga”. On 24 April 2009 the fifth defendant advised the sixth defendant’s employee that the first defendant then had a handwritten will nominating her daughters (to the exclusion of the plaintiff) as beneficiaries to receive her estate because the plaintiff had already had “Malaya” signed over to him. By the time of the final hearing of the proceedings there had been a subtle shift, but no less determination, in the first defendant’s expression of her testamentary intentions: her then current will nominated her grandchildren as beneficiaries. The plaintiff has no children. His sisters do.
	
	
	Each of the plaintiff’s sisters knew that the transfer of “Boronga” to them was by way of a gift – nominally for a consideration of $1.00 – in circumstances in which the object of the transfer was to divest the deceased (a vulnerable, mentally incapacitated man) of what was, to him and to the family, a significant asset.
	
	
	Each of them knew, or might easily have inferred from other known facts, that the principal object of the first defendant in effecting the transfer was not to benefit the deceased, but to advance the first defendant’s own idea of what was “fair” to her daughters. Marginalisation of the plaintiff in the process of effecting any transfer of property, and limiting his involvement to establishment of the Shadrack Partnership (in which a deed prepared on instructions of the first and fifth defendants was presented to him for execution as a fait accompli), in circumstances in which he lived on “Boronga” and held the deceased’s power of attorney jointly and severally with the first defendant, was an implicit acknowledgement of the first defendant’s motive.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s sisters knew, or must be taken to have known, the facts essential to a determination that, in purporting to effect a transfer of “Boronga” as the deceased’s attorney, the first defendant was acting for a purpose beyond what was proper upon an exercise of her power as attorney. They knew, or must be taken to have known, the facts essential to knowledge that the first defendant was acting in breach of her fiduciary obligations to the deceased.
	
	
	On any view of the “knowledge” required to attract the operation of the first limb of Barnes v Addy (as summarised in Simmons v NSW Trustee and Guardian [2014] NSWCA 405 at [90]), the plaintiff’s sisters acquired title to “Boronga” (on registration of the memorandum of transfer dated 1 July 2009 on 2 December 2009) with notice of the first defendant’s breach of the fiduciary obligations she owed to the deceased. On a view of the facts most generous to them, they had knowledge of facts (including the incapacity of their father, their mother’s deployment of her appointment as an enduring attorney, the improvident nature of the transaction and the dominant purpose of their mother in effecting a “fair” intergenerational transfer of property) which, to an honest and reasonable person, would have indicated the existence of fiduciary obligations owed by the first defendant to the deceased, and of a misapplication of the deceased’s property upon a purported exercise by the first defendant of her powers as his enduring attorney. They must be taken to have received title to “Boronga” on notice of the first defendant’s breach of her fiduciary obligations.
	
	
	Their notice of that breach was not “mere notice” of a type consistent with their acquisition of indefeasible title to “Boronga” by virtue of the Real Property Act 1900, section 42. Theirs was not a passive form of notice, but notice borne of active involvement in the process of divesting the deceased of his land.
	
	
	The plaintiff does not contend, and I do not find, that that process was attended by an element of dishonesty or moral turpitude. There is no reliance on the second limb of Barnes v Addy or the fraud exception to section 42. The process of transferring “Boronga” out of the deceased’s name was, nevertheless, a process grounded upon an unconscientious disregard by the plaintiff’s sisters of a want of authority in the first defendant and an equal disregard of her obligation to serve the deceased’s interests in her exercise of power as an attorney. The first defendant and her daughters did what they did upon an unwarranted assumption that it was open to them, in the name of “the family”, to appropriate the first defendant’s assets as they saw fit.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s sisters actively participated in the first defendant’s breach of her fiduciary obligations and, by securing registration of a memorandum of transfer that they had the means of knowing (if they did not know) was void as a fraud on power, they sought, as they still seek, to retain the benefit of what the first defendant, with their support, did to deprive the deceased of a significant asset, on terms patently improvident, knowing that (by reason of mental incapacity) the deceased was vulnerable to exploitation.
	
	
	This is unconscientious conduct on the part of the plaintiff’s sisters sufficient to warrant the intervention of equity. It is reminiscent of the observations made by Mahoney JA in the penultimate paragraph of his judgment in Stivactas v Michaletos (No. 2) [1994] ANZ Conv R 252; 1993) Aust Contract R 90-031; (1993) NSW Conv R 55-683; BC 9301874. The plaintiff’s sisters’ liability to have the transfer of “Boronga” to them set aside is ultimately grounded, not in notice of a default on the part of the first defendant, but on fault of their own, their personal engagement in conduct against good conscience.
	
	
	Subject to: (a) their discretionary defences of acquiescence; and (b) their claims for family provision relief, the plaintiff’s sisters are liable to orders in the nature of a declaration that they hold “Boronga” on trust for the estate of the deceased, coupled with consequential relief.
	
	
	There is no need to pursue questions about whether they might have a liability, at law (via the tort of negligence) or in equity (by way of an order for an account of profits or an award of compensation), to pay “damages” to, or at the suit of, the plaintiff. The primary remedy he seeks is transfer of “Boronga” to the estate of the deceased. He cannot claim more, for use of the land since 1 July 2009, without the operation of the Shadrack Partnership coming into view. I have already determined that no relief should be granted in respect of the partnership beyond that, agreed between the parties, directed towards its winding up, and the taking of partnership accounts, based upon accounts voluntarily adopted by the partners in the ordinary course of conducting the partnership business.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s sisters’ defence of “acquiescence” is expressed in terms to the following effect (in paragraph 14 of their amended defence) :
	


“In further answer to the whole of the statement of claim the second, third, fourth and fifth defendants say [that] since 2009, the plaintiff has been aware that ‘Boronga’ was transferred to them;… [he] has been carrying on business with them farming both ‘Boronga’ and the plaintiff’s property ‘Malaya’in a partnership with [them] known as the ‘Shadrack Partnership’; [and]… [he] has acquiesced in and affirmed the transfer of ‘Boronga’ to [them]”.


	
	This defence cannot succeed without attribution to the plaintiff, ex post facto, of a greater interest in “Boronga”, and a greater knowledge about his entitlement to “Boronga”, than he had before the commencement of these proceedings or thereabouts.
	
	
	Any entitlement the plaintiff has to “Boronga” remains, to the present day, an entitlement to due administration of the estate of the deceased consequent upon the death of the deceased: Livingston v Commissioner of Stamp Duties (Queensland)  (1960) 107 CLR 411 (High Court), affirmed at (1964) 112 CLR 12 (Privy Council).
	
	
	Not until after the death of the deceased did the plaintiff learn of the terms of the deceased’s will. The defective form of the will, and its need for rectification, added a further layer of complication justifying a period of deliberation on the part of the plaintiff.
	
	
	The terms of the partnership deed dated 1 July 2009 for the Shadrack Partnership said nothing about who owned, or the terms of ownership of, “Boronga”.
	
	
	The plaintiff was told by the first defendant in 2009 that she proposed unilaterally to transfer “Boronga” to his sisters, but she did not disclose to him at that time the terms of the deceased’s will.
	
	
	The Reilly family’s history of conducting farming operations on “Malaya” and “Boronga” via a partnership between persons not coincident with the identity of registered proprietors of the land went back to the year 2000, when “Malaya” was transferred to the plaintiff. The conduct of farming operations, after 1 July 2009, by the Shadrack Partnership was not, in this context, inconsistent with a reservation of rights relating to ownership of “Boronga” consequent upon the will, and death, of the deceased.
	
	
	There is no factual foundation for a finding that the plaintiff acquiesced in, or affirmed, the transfer of “Boronga” to his sisters. There was no calculated (that is, deliberate and informed) inaction by the plaintiff or standing by, which encouraged the defendants reasonably to believe that he accepted, or would not dispute, his sisters’ ownership of “Boronga” irrespective of any expression of testamentary intention in their father’s will: Byrnes v Kendle (2011) 243 CLR 253 at 279[79]-280[80]. There is nothing inequitable in the estate of the deceased, or in the plaintiff through the estate, asserting a claim to beneficial ownership of “Boronga”.
	
	
	Conclusion. Subject to consideration of their claims for family provision relief, the plaintiff’s sisters hold “Boronga” on trust for the estate of the deceased.
	


THE FAMILY PROVISION CLAIMS OF THE PLAINTIFF’S SISTERS

Introduction


	
	The plaintiff’s sisters’ several claims for family provision relief, under chapter 3 of the Succession Act 2006 NSW, are predicated upon a determination by the Court that “Boronga” forms part of the estate of the deceased. Accordingly, any family provision relief granted to them must be understood as conditional upon their return of legal title to “Boronga” to the estate.
	
	
	Although each claim must be the subject of separate evaluation, in the context of sections 59(1)(c) and 59(2) of the Succession Act 2006, some aspects of the claims can be dealt with in common.
	
	
	Each of the claimants, being a child of the deceased, is an “eligible person”, entitled to make an application for family provision relief by virtue of section 57(1)(c), read with section 59(1)(a).
	
	
	Each claimant requires an order under section 58(2) that the time within which an application for a family provision order may be made be extended. The cross summons, by which each claim for family provision relief was made, was filed on 9 December 2014, a fortnight or so shy of two years after the death of the deceased, almost a year outside the time limited by section 58 for the making of an application.
	
	
	There is no opposition to an extension of that time, and I am satisfied that sufficient cause has been shown for an extension. The defective form of the deceased’s will, and the need for resolution of the plaintiff’s claim for an order that it be rectified, provide a core foundation for the claimants’ delay.
	
	
	The absence of any application by the first defendant for family provision relief carries the consequence, for which section 61 of the Succession Act provides, that, in determining the claims for family provision relief before it, the Court may disregard the interests of the first defendant.
	
	
	The plaintiff has made no application for family provision relief but, as he is a beneficiary of the deceased under the will of the deceased as rectified, section 61 does not authorise a disregard of his interests.
	
	
	Upon a consideration of the evaluative questions for which sections 59(1)(c) and 59(2) of the Succession Act provide, and upon a review of the matters prescribed by section 60(2) for the Court’s consideration, I accept that each of the claimants, no less than their brother, had a loving and dutiful relationship with the deceased. I accept, also, that each child made a contribution to family life commensurate with age and experience. The Reilly family followed a pattern, not uncommonly found in rural Australia, in which the men did more of the outside work and the women did more of the inside work necessary to sustain life on a farm. As children, the deceased’s children dutifully performed what was required of them.
	
	
	The life of the Reilly family during the formative years of the deceased’s children was centred squarely upon the family farm. The deceased was quintessentially a farmer. The family rarely travelled elsewhere for holidays. Everybody enjoyed rural life.
	
	
	Apart from the bitterness generated by these proceedings and events leading up to them, there appear to have been close and loving relationships between all family members. I accept that, after the deceased’s descent into dementia, he made isolated statements disparaging of the plaintiff. However, I do not regard any such statements as indicative of a falling-out between father and son. There was a period of adjustment required as the deceased accommodated his declining health, and his inability to do what he once did around the farm. The plaintiff had operational responsibilities without unqualified authority within the family to discharge them. Tension between father and son in that environment was not exceptional.
	
	
	In adulthood, as manager of farming operations on “Malaya” and “Boronga”, the plaintiff has had a closer association with, and (it may be accepted) he has made a larger contribution to the deceased’s estate, than his sisters (with the possible exception of the fifth defendant, who kept accounts), at least since August 2008 or thereabouts when the deceased was injured in a farm accident and the dementia, first noticed in about 2007, increasingly took hold of him. I take into account here the plaintiff’s claims to have performed work in management of “Boronga” (and “Malaya”) beyond any entitlements recognised as paid, or due, to him in the Reilly family’s formal financial statements relating to the conduct of their collective business operations.
	
	
	That does not mean that the girls are not properly to be considered objects of the deceased’s bounty. Nor is the transfer of “Malaya” to the plaintiff by the first defendant in 2000 (effectively as a gift) to be disregarded in the process of evaluation attending his sisters’ claims for family provision relief.
	
	
	Chapter 3 of the Succession Act must be applied by reference to its text. It is not a vehicle for a blanket determination that the deceased’s children must (or must not) be treated “equally” or for implementation of the first defendant’s subjective notion of “fairness”. That said, the views of the first defendant, as the family matriarch, are entitled to deference.
	
	
	The first defendant and her daughters have a profound conviction that, as the deceased’s principal beneficiary under the rectified will, the plaintiff has received, or stands to receive, a share of the family wealth disproportionate to his contribution, and theirs. His disagreement with them about this is equally grounded in a strong conviction that he is entitled to “Boronga”.
	
	
	In approaching the evaluative questions for which sections 59(1)(c) and 59(2) of the Succession Act provide the Court is required to look through a prism focused on the present time, having regard to considerations of “justice and wisdom” (The Pontifical Society for the Propagation of the Faith v Scales (1962) 107 CLR 9 at 20) informed by prevailing community standards of what is right and appropriate (Andrew v Andrew (2012) 81 NSWLR 656 at 661[16] and 664-665[36]).
	
	
	So far as is material, sections 59(1)(c) and 59(2) are in the following terms:
	


“59(1)(c) The Court may, on an application [for family provision relief], make a family provision order in relation to the estate of a deceased person, if the Court is satisfied that…at the time when the Court is considering the application, adequate provision for the proper maintenance, education or advancement in life of the person in whose favour the order is made has not been made by the will of the deceased person….

59(2)   The Court may make such order for provision out of the estate of the deceased person as the Court thinks ought to be made for the maintenance, education or advancement in life of [the claimant for relief, if an eligible person], having regard to the facts known to the Court at the time the order is made.”


	
	What is “adequate” and “proper” in a particular case depends on the circumstances of the case; the concepts they embody are relative to those circumstances, not governed by an abstract absolute: The Pontifical Society for the Propagation of the Faith v Scales (1962) 107 CLR 9 at 19. An application of such concepts requires an exercise of evaluative judgment, not able to be reduced to an arithmetical formula premised, for example, upon an assumption that all claimants on the bounty of a deceased person are to be treated “equally”.
	
	
	Counsel for the claimants (without a dissenting voice) invited the Court to take into account, as principles material to a family provision claim by an adult child, observations made by Hallen J in Smith v Smith [2016] is NSWSC 1077 at [169]. So far as material, his Honour’s observations were as follows:
	


“(a) The relationship between parent and child changes when the child attains adulthood. However, a child does not cease to be a natural recipient of parental ties, affection or support as the bonds of childhood are relaxed.

(b) It is impossible to describe, in terms of universal application, the moral obligation, or community expectation, of a parent in respect of an adult child. It can be said that, ordinarily, the community expects parents to raise and educate their children to the very best of their ability while they remain children; probably to assist them with a tertiary education, where that is feasible; where funds allow, to provide them with a start in life, such as a deposit on a home, although it might well take a different form. The community does not expect a parent, in ordinary circumstances, to provide an unencumbered house, or to set his or her child up in a position where she or he can acquire a house unencumbered, although in a particular case, where assets permit and the relationship between the parties is such as to justify it, there might be such an obligation: McGrath v Eves [2005] NSWSC 1006; Taylor v Farrugia [2009] NSWSC 801 at [57]; Kohari v Snow [2013] NSWSC 452 at [121]; Salmon v Osmond [2015] NSWCA 42 at [109].

(c) Generally, also, the community does not expect a parent to look after his or her child for the rest of the child’s life and into retirement, especially when there is someone else, such as a spouse, who has a primary obligation to do so. Plainly, if an adult child remains a dependent of a parent, the community usually expects the parent to make provision to fulfil that ongoing dependency after death. But where a child, even an adult child, falls on hard times, and where there are assets available, then the community may expect a parent to provide a buffer against contingencies; and where a child has been unable to accumulate superannuation or make other provision for their retirement, something to assist in retirement where otherwise, they would be left destitute: Taylor v Farrugia at [58].

(d) If the applicant has an obligation to support others, such as a parent’s obligation to support a dependent child, that will be a relevant factor in determining what is an appropriate provision for the maintenance of the applicant: Re Buckland, Deceased [1966] VR 404 at 411; Hughes v National Trustees Executors and Agency Co of Australasia Limited [1979] HCA 2; (1979) 143 CLR 134 at 148; Goodman v Windeyer at 498, 505. But the Act does not permit orders to be made to provide for the support of third persons that the applicant, however reasonably, wishes to support, where there is no obligation of the deceased to support such persons: Re Buckland, Deceased at 411; Kleinig v Neal (No 2) [1981] 2 NSWLR 532 at 537; Mayfield v Lloyd-Williams at [86].

(e) There is no need for an applicant adult child to show some special need or some special claim: McCosker v McCosker; Kleinig v Neal (No 2) at 545; Bondelmonte v Blanckensee [1989] WAR 305; Hawkins v Prestage (1989) 1 WAR 37 at 45 (Nicholson J).

(f) The adult child’s lack of reserves to meet demands, particularly of ill health, which become more likely with advancing years, is a relevant consideration: MacGregor v MacGregor [2003] WASC 169 at [179]-[182]; Crossman v Riedel [2004] ACTSC 127 at [49]. Likewise, the need for financial security and a fund to protect against the ordinary vicissitudes of life are relevant: Marks v Marks [2003] WASCA 297 at [43]. In addition, if the applicant is unable to earn, or has a limited means of earning, an income, this could give rise to an increased call on the estate of the deceased: Christie v Manera [2006] WASC 287; Butcher v Craig [2009] WASC 164 at [17].

(g) The applicant has the onus of satisfying the Court, on the balance of probabilities, of the justification for the claim: Hughes v National Trustees, Executors and Agency Co of Australasia Limited at 149.

(h) although some may hold the view that equality between children does not discriminate between children according to gender, character, conduct or financial and material circumstances, the Act is not entirely consistent with that view. To the contrary, the Act specifically identifies, as matters that may be taken into consideration, individual conduct, circumstances, financial resources, including earning capacity, and financial needs, in the court's determination of the applicant's case.

In Barna v Barna [2008] NSWSC 1402, Brereton J noted, at [27]:

""The obligation to make provision for persons for whom the community would expect a testator to make provision does not import an obligation to deal with children equally. A testator is entitled to deal differently with his or her children, and the quality of the relationship that the testator has with each of the claimants on the estate is a relevant consideration.""

In Carey v Robson; Nicholls v Robson [2009] NSWSC 1142, Palmer J, at [57] – [58] commented:

""The strongest ground for relief urged by Rosemary and Marion, though put somewhat obliquely, is that the provision made for them by the testator is vastly disproportionate to the provision made for Alan. One can understand the sense of grievance which one child may have at being treated by a parent differently from another child. Some may be tempted to think that great disproportionality of testamentary treatment in itself indicates some essential error in the testamentary process which requires amelioration under the Family Provision Act so as to achieve approximate equality between a testator's children.

That is not, of course, a position from which one can begin in this, or in any other case under the family provision legislation.""


	
	In their joint submissions, the claimants acknowledged that their several claims may require differential responses by the Court. Having suggested a range of monetary sums as appropriate by way of a grant of legacies, in addition to provision made for the claimants as residuary beneficiaries of the deceased in his will as rectified, they invited the Court to order that “Boronga” be sold (reserving a right to the plaintiff to buy it) with the net proceeds of sale to be divided between the children of the deceased in the following proportions: the plaintiff 30%; the second defendant 10 %; the third defendant 30 %; the fourth defendant 20 %; and the fifth defendant 10 %.
	
	
	The plaintiff, for his part, submitted that, although the third defendant may have financial need to justify additional provision out of the estate of the deceased, the respective family provision claims of the second, fourth and fifth defendants should be dismissed.
	
	
	There is common ground between the competing claimants at least to the extent of an acknowledgement that the third defendant may have a special need in light of a breakdown in her marriage and her responsibility for the care of two teenage children.
	
	
	An assessment of the adequacy of provision made for the claimants, and of what is a proper standard of maintenance, education or advancement in life for them, respectively depends upon the size and nature of the deceased’s estate.
	
	
	The deceased died with assets, other than a beneficial entitlement to “Boronga”, apparently in the form of financial assets but not clearly identified or distinguished from other “family” assets.
	
	
	In his statement of claim, the plaintiff alleges (in particulars to paragraph 27) that, in addition to a (contested) right to recover “Boronga” or its true market value, “the deceased’s estate was comprised of, inter alia, bank credits totalling approximately $190,000”. The pleadings of the first defendant and her daughters, and more especially the manner of their defence of the proceedings, suggests that the parties are ad idem about this.
	
	
	By a letter dated 11 December 2013 the sixth defendant, acting on instructions of the first defendant, sent to the plaintiff his trust account cheque for $38,550.80, said to represent (it was said, without reference to any will) the plaintiff’s “one-fifth share” in the deceased’s estate. From that letter, an inference can be drawn that the deceased died with a distributable estate of the order of $192,754 or thereabouts.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s sisters appear to have embraced that figure, submitting that the deceased’s estate had a value of less than $200,000, which (under the rectified will of the deceased) was to be divided equally between them as residuary beneficiaries. On this reckoning, the provision made for them under the will of the deceased (as rectified) was of the order of $50,000 each.
	
	
	The plaintiff declined to accept the cheque (incidentally, dated 12 December 2013) proferred to him by the first defendant under cover of the sixth defendant’s letter dated 11 December 2013. Instead, he took legal advice.
	
	
	In substance, the focus for attention on the family provision claims of the plaintiff’s sisters is “Boronga”.
	
	
	There may need to be an accounting exercise undertaken to clarify the assets and liabilities of the deceased’s estate other than “Boronga”. The parties have, nevertheless, conducted the proceedings on the basis that the plaintiff’s sisters’ claims for family provision relief can, and should, be determined primarily by reference to “Boronga”.
	
	
	The absence of an up-to-date valuation of “Boronga” is a ground upon which the plaintiff’s sisters invite the Court to make percentage orders for provision based upon an order for sale.
	
	
	The evidence before the Court is that, as at 4 March 2015, the property had a fair market value of $1,275,000, assuming vacant possession. The fact is, however, that the plaintiff has long resided on “Boronga” and vacant possession is not to be had without requiring his departure from the property.
	
	
	The plaintiff contends that the current market value of “Boronga” is in the vicinity of $1 million - $1.2 million. There is no need to adopt that range specifically beyond an observation that the plaintiff cannot complain if his sisters’ claims for relief are dealt with upon the footing that the property is worth not less than $1 million.
	
	
	In any event, I am not persuaded that the quantum of any family provision relief to be granted to the plaintiff’s sisters is of such an order, jointly or severally, to necessitate a judicial sale of “Boronga”; or to warrant a grant of relief expressed in terms of percentage shares of proceeds of a forced sale, assuming that to be a form of relief which is otherwise appropriate.
	
	
	I also take into account that, in or about April 2014, when the plaintiff complained to her of having been “shafted” and having health problems, the first defendant (implicitly, from her own resources) caused $100,000 to be transferred to his account.
	
	
	In the assessment of the respective claims for family provision relief, I take into account that each of the children of the deceased is entitled to participate in the assets of the Shadrack Partnership upon its winding up. The extent of any such entitlement is not presently able to be determined with precision without up-to-date accounts. Nevertheless, a broad picture, sufficient for disposal of the family provision claims, is available based upon the partnership balance sheet as at 30 June 2015 (Exhibit 2D2).
	
	
	According to the balance sheet as at 30 June 2015:
	



	
	The net assets of the partnership had a total value of $481,488.11, principally representing cash assets of $465,818.63 and livestock valued at $13,568.13 , with liabilities (principally GST tax liabilities) totalling $1,795.10.
	
	
	The partners’ respective entitlements to the “proprietors’ funds” ($481,488.11) commensurate with those net assets were recorded as follows: plaintiff ($99,857.08); second defendant ($102,907.75); third defendant ($72,907.76); fourth defendant $102,907.76); and fifth defendant ($102,907.76).
	



	
	These figures do not make any allowance for, or explain, ownership of farm plant and equipment. Nor do they allow for variations in livestock (cattle) numbers after 30 June 2015. And they say nothing about the profitability of the partnership after 30 June 2015. They do, however, provide a general picture of the scale of the partnership business and the value of the partners’ respective interests.
	
	
	I take into account, but without attributing any significant weight to it, the determination of the first defendant to leave her estate, in due course, to the children of her daughters, to the exclusion of the plaintiff. On 1 May 2015 the first defendant deposed to her personal ownership of financial assets and shares worth about $950,000 in total. That is consistent with observations made by her, or the fifth defendant, to the sixth defendant’s employee in 2009. However, there is no up-to-date statement of the first defendant’s financial position in evidence.
	
	
	As a practical matter, the question for the Court is whether, as a charge on “Boronga”, the plaintiff’s sisters should be granted legacies to supplement their participation in the deceased’s estate as residuary beneficiaries.
	
	
	In describing the particular financial circumstances of members of the Reilly family, I omit express reference to their interests in the Shadrack Partnership and any income derived from the partnership. For the most part, although the partners paid tax on income attributed to them, partnership income accrued for the ongoing benefit of the farming operations. The partners’ respective interests in the partnership – its assets and income generated – must not be disregarded; but precise quantification of the value of those interests must await an agreed process of accounting to follow the making of an order for the partnership to be wound-up.
	


The Second Defendant’s Particular Circumstances


	
	The second defendant, born in 1962, is the eldest of the deceased’s children.
	
	
	She lived at home until the completion of her secondary education, after she had completed Year 12, in 1979.
	
	
	Between 1980-1983 or thereabouts she undertook secretarial studies at Canberra College of Advanced Education, training which equipped her for a career in administration.
	
	
	Since that time, she has lived in Sydney (1983-1986), Adelaide (1986-1990), Brisbane (1990-1998) and the Narrabri (since 1998).
	
	
	She never lost touch with her parents during her years away from “Boronga”. Her move to Narrabri facilitated regular contact with them.
	
	
	When she moved to Adelaide, she was accompanied by John (“Jock”), now her husband. They married after they moved to Brisbane.
	
	
	They have two sons, respectively born in 1993 and 1995. Both boys have attained their majority and are living away from home, in Sydney. The older son is pursuing a career in engineering. The younger son is in pursuit of a career as a mechanic. Both are partially dependent on their parents.
	
	
	The second defendant is in generally good health. Nevertheless, she and her husband (about two years her senior) hope to retire in the next year or so. Their plan is to move to a property they jointly own, and use as a holiday house, at Laurieton. They also own a home unit at Laurieton, subject to a mortgage.
	
	
	Their principal assets, apart from their Laurieton properties, comprise superannuation entitlements, two cars of modest value, a small amount of shares and a modest bank account credit.
	
	
	Their net assets (after allowing for a loan of about $128,500 owed to the bank on the investment property) have a value of about $1.7 million.
	
	
	As they approach retirement, the second defendant has a gross taxable income of approximately $64,000 per annum and her husband has a gross income of approximately $78,000.
	
	
	Whether or not their superannuation entitlements will sustain them in retirement is a matter of concern, but not a substantial impediment to their retirement plans.
	
	
	The second defendant’s self-description is that she and her husband live a simple but comfortable life focusing on their work, spending time with their children and family holidays in Laurieton. If allowed further provision out of the estate of the deceased, they would look, possibly, to an overseas holiday, renovation of the Laurieton house and purchase of new cars.
	


The Third Defendant’s Particular Circumstances


	
	The third defendant, born in 1964, is the second eldest of the deceased’s children.
	
	
	She lived at home until the completion of her secondary education at the end of year 10.
	
	
	Since that time she has lived in a wide variety of places (in succession, Parkes, Melbourne, Canberra, Condobolin, Parkes again, Sydney and Orange) before settling in Brisbane with her husband, Shane.
	
	
	She married Shane in 1998. They separated in 2015.
	
	
	There are two children of the marriage. The older child (a son) was born in 1999, the younger child (a daughter) in 2001. Both remain at school and are dependent upon their mother.
	
	
	Since leaving school herself the third defendant has worked in a variety of jobs, commencing with employment in a pharmacy at Parkes for four years immediately after she left school. She trained as a hairdresser in Melbourne and as a nurse in Sydney. With the birth of her sons she turned her focus to her family, a consequence of which is that her registration as a nurse lapsed, leaving her (following collapse of her marriage) to employment as a nursing assistant, with precarious employment prospects.
	
	
	As a nursing assistant, her annual wages (assuming ongoing employment) are of the order of $55,000.
	
	
	Consequent upon a property settlement with her husband (subject to court approval at the time of the hearing of the current proceedings), her assets comprise a house in suburban Brisbane (valued at about $660,000), superannuation (approximately $84,000), a car (valued at about $8,000), Medibank shares (valued at $16,000 dollars) and savings of approximately $107,000. Her liabilities are modest, but her ability to meet ordinary living expenses for herself and her sons is severely constrained, notwithstanding that her estranged husband has agreed to pay $700 per week in child support and to pay for the childrens’ education expenses and private health cover.
	
	
	She does not report ill health generally, but she has suffered from a hernia requiring an operation.
	


The Fourth Defendant’s Particular Circumstances


	
	The fourth defendant, born in 1965, is the middle child of the deceased’s five children.
	
	
	She completed her school education in Parkes, following which she followed her mother into the nursing profession. She continues to work as a nurse, providing the primary source of her family’s income.
	
	
	She married her husband Peter in 1985. They have three adult children: a son, born in 1988; a daughter, born in 1990; and a son, born in 1992. The youngest of the children suffers from a mild developmental disability which requires him to receive ongoing support from his parents.
	
	
	The fourth defendant has lived all her life in the Parkes-Forbes area, the region in which “Boronga” is located.
	
	
	She and her husband own (subject to a substantial mortgage, of the order of $620,000) three farming properties, farmed as one, comprising a total of 1280 acres. The farm produces only a small income or, not uncommonly, a loss. Hence it is that the fourth defendant and her husband depend significantly on her income as a nurse. Her annual income from nursing is of the order of $74,000.
	
	
	The fourth defendant appears to be in good health. Her husband’s health is indifferent; he is aged about 60 years, smokes and suffers from chest pains.
	
	
	The fourth defendant anticipates that, when her husband is no longer able to manage the family farm, she and he will move into a house (valued at about $480,000) he owns in Forbes. She has superannuation valued at approximately $140,000; her husband has superannuation valued at about $81,000. They have a small amount of shares (valued at about $11,400), modest savings and a car.
	
	
	Their principal assets are the farm and Peter’s house in Forbes. Their aspiration is to reduce their debts so as to facilitate an intergenerational transfer of their farm to their children, and to enable them to assist each of their children in the meantime.
	
	
	Their joint assets have a net value of approximately $1.5 million, to which must be added their separate assets. The fourth defendant’s assets have a value of about $140,000. Peter’s have a value of about $610,000.
	


The Fifth Defendant’s Particular Circumstances


	
	The fifth defendant, born in 1969, is the youngest of the deceased’s children, ranking in age immediately after the plaintiff.
	
	
	She lived at home until the completion of her secondary education at the end of Year 12 in 1986.
	
	
	Between 1987-1989 or thereabouts she attended Charles Sturt University at Wagga Wagga, from which she graduated with a Bachelor of Business degree.
	
	
	She moved to Canberra in January 1990 and, except for a sojourn overseas in 1995, she has lived there ever since.
	
	
	She married her husband Ian (a Commonwealth public servant) in 2001. They have three teenage children: a son born in 2002, a daughter born in 2003; and a son born in 2006. All three are presently at high school.
	
	
	With the benefit of her university degree, the fifth defendant earns a substantial income (approximately $175,000 per annum). Ian’s income is approximately $68,000 per annum.
	
	
	They own their own home in Canberra (valued at about $1.2 million) and they have a farming property at Murrumbateman (valued at about $710,000). Their residence is subject to a mortgage debt of about $390,000.
	
	
	In her own right, the fifth defendant owns assets (principally shares) worth about $950,000. She and her husband have joint net assets (principally their home and farm) with an estimated value of about $1.5 million. In his own right, Ian has assets (principally superannuation) worth about $435,000.
	
	
	In about 2004 the plaintiff, the first defendant and the fifth defendant together purchased (in the names of the plaintiff and the fifth defendant only) a house in Forbes which, initially, served as an investment but which, since 2009, has served as the first defendant’s retirement residence. A fair inference from the evidence is that, although the first defendant’s name does not appear on the title to the property, she has a right of residence for life, if not a life estate, in equity.
	
	
	The fifth defendant’s aspirations include hopes for the education of her children, home renovations and farm improvements. Her family must cope, also, with the ordinary vicissitudes of health in teenage children and middle-aged parents.
	


The Plaintiff’s Particular Circumstances


	
	The plaintiff, born in 1967, is the fourth of the deceased’s five children.
	
	
	After he completed high school in 1984 he spent about 16 months working full time as a farm hand on “Boronga”, after which he spent about eight years settling upon career qualifications, living for a time in Wagga Wagga, Canberra, Sydney and Orange. For a few months he studied radiography at Charles Sturt University in Wagga, before turning to the trade of a plumber. He commenced his plumbing apprenticeship in Canberra and finished it in Sydney. He completed academic work to become a Master Plumber in Orange. Between the time when he completed his apprenticeship in Sydney and when he pursued his master plumber qualifications in Orange he lived and worked at “Boronga”.
	
	
	There is a perception within the family circle of the first defendant and her daughters that the plaintiff has been restlesstly torn between pursuing the trade of a plumber and devoting himself to farming. That perception is, in my assessment, a reflection of his having been given responsibilities for farmwork on “Malaya” and “Boronga” without having authority to run his own race. He has undoubtedly benefited from the transfer of “Malaya” to him in 2000, and in other ways, but the farming business has never, in a practical sense, been entirely his to run as he pleases.
	
	
	Between 2000-2009 the farming business of the family was conducted by a partnership of the deceased and the first defendant. Since 2009 it has been conducted by a partnership between the plaintiff and his sisters.
	
	
	In the earlier period, the plaintiff was subject specifically to the directions of his parents. In the later period he has been subject to the strong influence of his mother, the demands of his sisters to sell up “Boronga” or to buy them out, and the uncertainty of the current proceedings. He has divided his time between plumbing (first, in self employment and, subsequently, as a full time maintenance plumber at the Parkes District Hospital) and farming. He has attended to “on the property” chores relating to operation of the farm since 2009, and the fifth defendant has attended to accounting work. He says, and I accept, that he has never fully understood the financial aspects of the Shadrack Partnership, believing that the partnership was in some way conducted as a proxy for the deceased and the first defendant.
	
	
	If these proceedings have achieved nothing else, they have confirmed that the farming operations on “Malaya” and “Boronga” since 1 July 2009 have been conducted by the plaintiff and his sisters, on their own account, as partners of the Shadrack Partnership. The first defendant has acquiesced in the conduct of the proceedings on that basis. So too have the plaintiff and his sisters, the partners in the partnership and the only persons beneficially entitled to the estate of the deceased.
	
	
	The plaintiff has a concern, probably well founded, that, if farming operations on “Malaya” and “Boronga” are to be commercially viable, a combined area of not less than the two properties is a necessity. He apprehends that, if deprived of ownership of “Boronga”, he could not long retain “Malaya” as a viable operation, despite the fact that he has acquired a 50% interest in an adjoining 100 acre property.
	
	
	In his evidence the plaintiff speaks of his partner (or spouse), Lee, without elaborating their domestic arrangements. He and Lee have no children.
	
	
	The plaintiff has a long history of kidney disease which, he apprehends, will eventually require him to have a kidney transplant.
	
	
	He has acquired a substantial amount of property, including investment properties, a share portfolio, cash investments and superannuation entitlements.
	
	
	The precise value of his estate is not revealed by the evidence, but he is well able to cope with his indebtedness of about $270,000 to the bank.
	
	
	He acknowledges receipt of a bank transfer of $100,000 from his mother in or about April 2010 but says that he did not solicit that money and he has kept it separate, invested without drawing upon it.
	
	
	The proceedings having been conducted by the defendants on the basis that that money was a gift made to him by the first defendant from her own resources, he would be justified in proceeding hereafter on the basis that it belongs to him unqualified by any claim by his mother or sisters.
	


The Succession Act, 2006 NSW, sections 59(1)(c) and 59(2)


	
	No “conduct disentitling”. As a preliminary to consideration of the operation of sections 59(1)(c) and 59(2) of the Succession Act, I observe that the plaintiff has not contended that a bar to success of his sisters’ respective family provision claims is an element of “conduct disentitling”, on the part of his sisters, arising from their participation in their mother’s breach of fiduciary obligations owed to the deceased.
	
	
	For convenience only do I use the expression “conduct disentitling”, an echo of the long-since repealed provisions of section 3(2) of the Testator’s Family Maintenance and Guardianship of Infants Act 1916 NSW, which authorised the Court to refuse to grant an order for family provision relief “in favour of any person whose character or conduct is such as to disentitle him [sic] to the benefit of such an order”.
	
	
	Sections 59(1)(c) and 59(2) of the Succession Act, read in the context of section 60 of the Act, require all the circumstances of a case to be taken into account.
	
	
	The matters which section 60(2) specifically authorise the Court to take into account include (in section 60(2)(m)) “the character and conduct of the applicant [for family provision relief] before and after the death of the deceased…” and (in section 60(2)(n)) “the conduct of any other person before and after the date of the death of the deceased…”.
	
	
	Those matters are found, in section 60(2), in a long list of matters bearing upon the nature, quality and duration of personal relationships; the nature and extent of obligations or responsibilities; the nature and extent of the deceased’s estate and any notional estate; available financial resources, and needs, of those who have a claim on the bounty of the deceased; the personal circumstances of such persons; any contribution made by an applicant for relief to the estate or welfare of the deceased, or to his or her family; and any provision made for the applicant by the deceased, amongst other broadly stated matters. There is, under this legislation, no narrowly focussed concept of “conduct disentitling” as there was under the 1916 Act.
	
	
	Although the plaintiff has characterised the conduct of his mother, and his sisters, in transferring “Boronga” out of the name of the deceased, as “unconscionable” or “unconscientious” in the sense understood by equity lawyers, he has deliberately refrained from characterising their conduct as dishonest or the like.
	
	
	I do likewise. I also take into account the fact that the plaintiff’s sisters, in common with their mother, acted in reliance upon legal services provided to them by the sixth defendant’s firm. I accept that those services were provided without ill-intent, although (as I find) negligently.
	
	
	In these circumstances, I proceed on the basis that nothing in the conduct of the claimants for family provision relief, in their participation in an inter vivos transfer of “Boronga” to them, precludes relief being granted to them under Chapter 3 of the Succession Act.
	
	
	Succession Act, section 59(1)(c). I am satisfied that each of the claimants for family provision relief, in varying degrees, is a person for whom (within the meaning of section 59(1)(c) of the Succession Act) adequate provision has not been made in the will of the deceased (as rectified) for her proper maintenance, education or advancement in life.
	
	
	In the respective cases of the second, fourth and (especially) the fifth defendants, the extent of the inadequacy of provision made for them is a function of the obligation of the deceased to provide, out of an estate sufficiently ample for the purpose, an allowance for contingencies, additional security against adversity as they look towards retirement and managing their employment and families in the meantime. To paraphrase Blore v Lang (1960) 104 CLR 124 at 135 (commonly associated with Gorton v Parks (1989) 17 NSWLR 1 at 9), their “need is not for the bread and butter of life but for a little of the cheese or jam that a wise and just parent would appreciate should be provided if circumstances permit”.
	
	
	As has been recognised on both sides of the bar table, the third defendant’s particular circumstances demonstrate a need greater than that of her sisters. She is not wholly without assets, means of earning an income or financial assistance from her estranged husband, but her domestic circumstances are less stable, her property is less valuable, her employment is more precarious and her prospects are more limited, all the while with teenage children to nurture.
	
	
	The proceedings have been conducted upon an assumption that, the deceased’s will having been rectified, the claimants, as the deceased’s residuary beneficiaries, were entitled to receive $50,000 or thereabouts from his estate. If their respective interests in the Shadrack Partnership are to be taken into account as emanating, in part at least, from the deceased, their present entitlements increase by $100,000 or thereabouts. Those entitlements do not represent a charge on “Boronga”, a property with a value of not less than $1 million or thereabouts.
	
	
	The deceased endeavoured to ensure that his children received an education and vocational training commensurate with each child’s personal circumstances. Afflicted by a dementia in the final years of his life, he was denied a final opportunity to marshall his resources for the benefit of his family. By contrast, the Court is required, by section 59(1)(c), to consider questions about adequacy of provision “at the time when the Court is considering” an application for family provision relief.
	
	
	Succession Act, section 59(2). The power of the Court to “make such order for provision out of the estate of the deceased… as the Court thinks ought to be made for the maintenance, education or advancement in life” of each claimant for family provision relief requires that the Court have regard to the facts known to the Court at the time an order is made.
	
	
	In my opinion, each of the claimants for family provision relief should receive, in addition to the provision made for them in the will of the deceased (as rectified), a legacy charged upon “Boronga”.
	
	
	In the case of each of the second and fourth defendants that legacy should be fixed at $80,000. I am disinclined to adopt differential legacies because, although the claimants’ respective circumstances differ, they are not so materially different as to warrant different treatment.
	
	
	The fifth defendant, on the other hand, is so much wealthier, and in such comparatively secure employment, that, in my opinion, the legacy allowed to her should be fixed at $60,000. No greater family provision relief should be granted than is necessary to address the inadequacy of provision made for the claimant. A legacy of $60,000 serves that purpose.
	
	
	The third defendant differs from her sisters in both the scale and nature of her need. She should be allowed a legacy in the sum of $275,000.
	
	
	These legacies, in total, provide for a sum of $495,000 to be charged against “Boronga”.
	
	
	That sum represents a charge on “Boronga” which is substantial but not more than half the value attributed to the property.
	
	
	I remain mindful of a need, implicit in the terms of the will of the deceased as rectified, to allow the plaintiff an opportunity to continue farming operations on “Malaya” and “Boronga” should he wish, and otherwise be able, to do so.
	
	
	Given the state of the title to “Boronga” and an evident need in the plaintiff to arrange finance to fund legacies in favour of his sisters, the legacies to be ordered in favour of the claimants should be payable (and bear interest at the rate for which section 84A of the Probate and Administration Act 1898 NSW provides) only after the expiry of a reasonable time (which I presently estimate to be four months) following registration of title to “Boronga” in the plaintiff as administrator of the estate of the deceased.
	
	
	Such, if any, consequential relief should be granted to the parties to ensure that the estate of the deceased is administered in a manner that moves, as expeditiously as possible, towards vesting “Boronga” in the plaintiff and securing the entitlements of his sisters in the meantime.
	


THE PLAINTIFF’S CLAIM AGAINST THE SIXTH DEFENDANT

Introduction


	
	In his statement of claim the plaintiff pleads against the sixth defendant a personal claim to damages on a cause of action in tort. He contends that he has a cause of action in negligence that fits within a paradigm of cases defined by Hill v Van Erp (1997) 188 CLR 159, Perre Apand Pty Limited (1999) 198 CLR 180 and Badenach v Calvert (2016) 257 CLR 440. To those cases might be added a reference to Hawkins v Clayton (1988) 164 CLR 539.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s claim is made in his personal capacity. It is not a claim asserted on behalf of the estate of the deceased or grounded upon the plaintiff’s status as an attorney of the deceased. It is based upon his claim to have been, throughout the sixth defendant’s performance of his retainer (particularly between about 1 July 2009, when the contract for sale and the memorandum of transfer relating to “Boronga” were executed, and 2 December 2009, when the memorandum of transfer was registered), a prospectively disappointed beneficiary of the deceased. It is, in that sense, a claim made through the deceased. The plaintiff claims that he personally was owed a duty of care incidental to, and consistent with, a duty of care owed by the sixth defendant to the deceased.
	
	
	A difference between the plaintiff’s claim and each of Hawkins v Clayton, Hill v Van Erp and Badenach v Calvert (the solicitor negligence cases upon which the plaintiff relies) is that, unlike the defendant solicitor in those cases, the sixth defendant did not draw the will upon which the plaintiff relies for his status as a prospectively disappointed beneficiary. On the other hand, the sixth defendant was aware of the terms of the deceased’s will and he acted upon an inter vivos transaction which, by disposal of the deceased’s principal asset, profoundly affected the operation of the will.
	
	
	If I am correct in my determination that the plaintiff’s sisters hold “Boronga” on trust for the estate of the deceased, the plaintiff’s claim against the sixth defendant largely, if not completely, falls away. An award of nominal damages may be in order. Proof of damage is an essential ingredient in a cause of action in negligence; damage is the gist of the action: Williams v Milotin (1957) 97 CLR 465 at 474; Badenach v Calvert (2016) 257 CLR 440 at 458[59], citing Hill v Van Erp (1997) 188 CLR 159 at 167-168 and 197.
	
	
	In his statement of claim (paragraph 67) the plaintiff particularises his damage as the loss of an “opportunity to receive from the deceased the bequest of the land known as ‘Boronga’”. If (as I have held) the deceased’s will must be rectified and “Boronga” is held on trust for the deceased’s estate, the plaintiff will have suffered no loss as a result of a breach by the sixth defendant of any duty of care owed to him, save possibly an unpleaded loss associated with the costs and inconvenience associated with litigation with his mother and sisters.
	
	
	In presentation of their respective cases, the parties gave little attention to identification of the time at which any cause of action to which the plaintiff was entitled accrued or to identification of the date at which any entitlement to damages should be assessed. The parties’ principal focus was on whether the sixth defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff. An assumption appears to have been made that any cause of action accrued on 2 December 2009, upon registration of the plaintiff’s sisters’ title to “Boronga”. Even if (as I find) it accrued upon the death of the deceased on 22 December 2012, a question could arise as to whether any entitlement to damages should be assessed at the time the cause of action accrued or at the time of trial and, if the former, whether (and, if so, to what extent) an assessment of damages could and should take into account the Court’s subsequent findings about rectification and beneficial ownership of “Boronga”.
	
	
	The general rule that damages for tort are to be assessed as at the time a cause of action accrued is not universal in its operation; it can be accommodated in the interests of justice (Johnson v Perez (1988) 166 CLR 351 at 355-356, 367, 371 and 380), bearing in mind the compensatory purpose of an award of damages.
	
	
	An award of equitable compensation (such as has been sought against the first defendant) differs from an award of common law damages because generally assessed at the time of trial: Re Dawson (deceased) [1966] 2 NSWR 211; 84 WN (Pt 1) (NSW) 399. Cf, ASA Constructions Pty Limited v Iwanov [1975] 1 NSWLR 512; Madden v Keveresky [1983] 1 NSWLR 305.
	
	
	An award of pre-judgment interest (under section 100 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 NSW) on damages assessed at “the date of breach” of a duty might, but will not necessarily, bridge any gap between that assessment and an assessment as at the time of trial.
	
	
	Too late in the course of the trial to be allowed, the plaintiff applied to amend his statement of claim to include a claim against the sixth defendant based upon the second limb of Barnes v Addy. He must be held to the cause of action in negligence upon which he opened his case.
	
	
	Against the possibility of an appeal challenging my primary findings as to rectification of the deceased’s will and beneficial ownership of “Boronga”, I am bound to deal with the plaintiff’s claim for damages against the sixth defendant.
	


The pleaded case of the plaintiff


	
	In his statement of claim the plaintiff pleads against the sixth defendant, inter alia, allegations to the following effect:
	



	
	At all material times the sixth defendant was a solicitor of the Supreme Court of New South Wales carrying on practice at Forbes in the State of New South Wales (S/C 4(a)).
	
	
	At all material times he was the employer of Mr McCallum, also a solicitor of the Supreme Court of NSW (S/C 4(b)).
	
	
	Between about 30 June 2009 and 2 December 2009 the sixth defendant was retained by his co-defendants, and each of them, to act as solicitor and to facilitate the transfer of “Boronga” unto the second, third, fourth and fifth defendants (S/C 4(c)).
	
	
	On or about 2 December 2009, by his employee Mr McCallum, the sixth defendant participated with and procured his co-defendants and each of them to transfer “Boronga” unto the second, third, fourth and fifth defendants (S/C 4(d)).
	
	
	On or about to December 2009 the defendants, and each of them, acting in unison, procured the transfer of “Boronga” unto the second, third, fourth and fifth defendants (S/C 26), particularised as recorded in paragraph [165] above).
	
	
	Between July and December 2009 the defendants, and each of them, knew or ought to have known that the deceased’s testamentary intention was that, upon his death, “Boronga” should pass in an unencumbered state unto the plaintiff together with two-thirds of the deceased’s interest in the capital of the FB & ML Reilly Partnership (S/C 37).
	
	
	In consequence of that fact, the defendants, and each of them, knew or should have known or foreseen that the plaintiff was a person who was vulnerable to economic loss and damage in the event that any act or thing was done by them which would defeat the deceased’s testamentary intentions (S/C 38).
	
	
	In consequence of their knowledge of the deceased’s testamentary intentions, and the vulnerability of the plaintiff in the event that any act or thing was done by them which would defeat those testamentary intentions, the defendants and each of them owed to the plaintiff a duty not to do any act or thing which would defeat the deceased’s testamentary intentions (S/C 39).
	
	
	At all material times the first-fifth defendants, by themselves and/or their servant and/or agent the sixth defendant, knew or should have known that the first defendant in her capacity as an attorney for the deceased had no power to make an improvident transfer of “Boronga” unto the second, third, fourth and fifth defendants (S/C 40).
	
	
	At all material times the second-sixth defendants ,and each of them, knew or should have known that they were not entitled to participate with the first defendant in an improvident transfer of “Boronga” to the second, third, fourth and fifth defendants (S/C 41).
	
	
	At all material times the defendants, and each of them, knew or ought to have known that an improvident transfer of “Boronga” by the first defendant, purporting to act as attorney for the deceased, to the second, third, fourth and fifth defendants was a void or voidable transaction (S/C 42).
	
	
	In the circumstances of the facts pleaded in the statement of claim, at all material times the defendants, and each of them, were under duties not to participate in an improvident transfer of “Boronga” and/or in any conduct which would defeat the deceased’s testamentary intentions (S/C 43).
	
	
	The sixth defendant, by his servant Mr McCallum, was at all material times the servant and/or agent of the defendants, and/or each of them, in the circumstances of the improvident and ultra vires transfer of “Boronga” unto the second, third, fourth and fifth defendants (S/C 44).
	
	
	As a solicitor of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, Mr McCallum knew or ought to have known that the first defendant was not empowered by the power of attorney to make an improvident transfer of “Boronga” unto the second, third, fourth and fifth defendants, and that any such improvident transfer of “Boronga” was void or voidable (S/C 45).
	
	
	As a solicitor of the Supreme Court, Mr McCallum knew, ought to have known of or ought to have ascertained the testamentary intentions of the deceased with respect to “Boronga”, and the deceased’s interest in the FB & ML Reilly Partnership, before accepting a retainer to transfer “Boronga” to the second, third, fourth and fifth defendants without payment of valuable consideration by the transferees (S/C 46).

KIEFEL  CJ,  BELL  AND  KEANE  JJ.      In  2014  the  Parliament  of  Tasmania 
enacted  the  Workplaces  (Protection  from  Protesters)  Act  2014  (Tas)  (""the 
Protesters Act""), the title of which reads: 

""An  Act  to  ensure  that  protesters  do  not  damage  business  premises  or 
business-related objects, or prevent, impede or obstruct the carrying out of 
business activities on business premises, and for related purposes"". 

 
A ""protester"" is defined in the Protesters Act to mean a person engaging in 
a ""protest activity"", namely, an activity that takes place on business premises or a 
business access area in relation to business premises in furtherance of, or for the 
purposes  of  promoting  awareness  of  or  support  for,  an  opinion  or  belief  in 
respect  of  a  political,  environmental,  social,  cultural  or  economic  issue1.    A 
person  engages  in  protest  activity  if  the  person  ""participates,  other  than  as  a 
bystander, in a demonstration, a parade, an event, or a collective activity, that is a 
protest activity""2.  A person is not to be taken to be engaging in a protest activity 
if they have the consent of a business occupier to be on the premises and to there 
engage in the protest activity3. 

 
The  definitions  of  ""business  premises""  and  ""business  access  area,  in 
relation  to  business  premises""  (""business  access  area"")  and  their  place  in  the 
Protesters Act will be discussed in more detail later in these reasons.  It suffices 
presently  to  note  that  the  definition  of  ""business  premises""  includes  ""forestry 
land""4, which is relevantly ""an area of land on which forest operations are being 
carried out""5. 

 
The  two  plaintiffs  were  present  at  different  times  in  the  Lapoinya  Forest 
for the purpose of raising public and political awareness about the logging of the 
forest  and  voicing  protest  to  it.    They  were  each  arrested  and  charged  with 
offences  under  the  Protesters  Act.    The  charges  against  the  plaintiffs  were  not 
proceeded  with  and  were  ultimately  dismissed  when  no  evidence  was  tendered 
by the prosecution with respect to them.

The plaintiffs challenge the validity of certain provisions of the Protesters 
 
Act,  and  to  that  end  invoke  the  test  for  invalidity  stated  in  Lange  v  Australian 
Broadcasting  Corporation6  as  explained  in  McCloy  v  New  South  Wales7  with 
respect  to  laws  which  restrict  the  freedom  of  communication  about  matters  of 
politics and government which is implied in the Constitution.  The first question 
stated  by  the  parties  in  the  Special  Case  asks  whether  either  or  both  of  the 
plaintiffs  have  standing  to  seek  the  relief  sought.    There  is  now  no  dispute 
concerning  the  plaintiffs'  standing  because  the  defendant  has  conceded  that  the 
plaintiffs  have  standing.    That  question  therefore  need  not  be  answered.    It  is 
necessary  also  to  amend  the  second  question  so  that  it  refers  to  business  access 
areas  in  relation  to  forestry  land,  in  addition  to  forestry  land.    Accordingly  the 
two remaining questions stated by the parties for the determination of the Court 
should read as follows: 

(2) 

Is  the  Workplaces  (Protection  from  Protesters)  Act  2014  (Tas), 
either in its entirety or in its operation in respect of forestry land or 
business access areas in relation to forestry land, invalid because it 
impermissibly  burdens 
freedom  of  political 
communication contrary to the Commonwealth Constitution? 

implied 

the 

(3)  Who should pay the costs of the Special Case? 

 
The Protesters Act has a wider application than to business premises that 
are  forestry  land.    Indeed  the  definition  of  ""business  premises""  in  s 5  of  the 
Protesters  Act  extends  to  various  business  premises  as  that  term  might  be 
ordinarily understood, and to business activities conducted upon them.  However, 
the facts in the Special Case are limited to operations conducted on forestry land 
and protests with respect to them.  There is also a particular historical, social and 
legislative  background  to  forest  operations  and  public  access  to  forests  in 
Tasmania, and demonstrations in forests appear to have been the catalyst for the 
Protesters Act.  In the course of argument the plaintiffs effectively restricted their 
case to key provisions of the Protesters Act so far as they concern forestry land.  
The  Court  should  not  speculate  about  the  operation  and  effect  of  the  Protesters 
Act in other contexts.  These reasons are therefore limited to the question of the 
validity  of  the  relevant  provisions  of  the  Protesters  Act  in  their  operation  with 
respect  to  forestry  land  or  business  access  areas  in  relation  to  forestry  land, 
namely, ss 6, 7, 8, 11 and 13 and Pt 4 of the Protesters Act.

The  Lapoinya  Forest  is  situated  near  the  township  of  Lapoinya  in  North 
West Tasmania.  It is some 89 hectares in size.  Part of the forest was identified 
as Forestry Coupe FD053A (""the coupe"") in a Forest Practices Plan (""the FPP"") 
which was submitted by Forestry Tasmania to the relevant authority in December 
2015  to  obtain  authorisation  to  conduct  forest  operations8.    That  authorisation 
was provided.  Those operations included tree felling in the coupe. 

Forestry  Tasmania  is  the  ""Forest  Manager""  as  defined  by  the  Forest 
 
Management Act  2013  (Tas)  (""the  FMA"")  and  has  the  management  and  control 
of  all  land  which  is  ""permanent  timber  production  zone  land""  (""PTPZ  land"")9.  
The land in the coupe was PTPZ land within the meaning of the FMA.  If forest 
operations  are  occurring  on  PTPZ  land,  that  land  is  ""forestry  land""  for  the 
purposes of the Protesters Act.   

 
The  map  which  accompanied  the  FPP  identified  the  boundaries  of  the 
coupe and the boundaries of the ""harvest area"" within it in which tree felling was 
permitted.    The  land  which  the  FPP  so  identified  did  not  include  any  land 
declared as reserved land under the  Nature Conservation Act 2002 (Tas).  Land 
of this kind abutted the south eastern boundary of the forest (""the Reserve""). 

 
The work undertaken by Forestry Tasmania in the coupe involved clearing 
old forest roads and constructing new roads in preparation for logging.  Forestry 
Tasmania  decided  to  close  two  forest  roads  –  that  part  of  Maynes  Road  which 
was  within  the  coupe,  and  Broxhams  Road,  which  bounded  the  south  eastern 
boundary of the coupe.  It did so by erecting signs advising of the closure of the 
roads  to  all  unauthorised  vehicular  and  pedestrian  traffic  and  by  suspending 
chains  across  the  roads  a  short  distance  from  the  signs,  as  it  is  entitled  to  do 
under  the  FMA.    Some  of  the  operations  undertaken  by  Forestry  Tasmania 
involve the use of heavy machinery.  It is accepted that it has statutory duties and 
obligations  to  ensure,  so  far  as  reasonably  practicable,  the  health  and  safety  of 
persons from those operations10.

applying to Forest Practices Plans.

The announcement by Forestry Tasmania of its intention to fell trees in the 
coupe  in  the  Lapoinya  Forest  resulted  in  public  protests,  including  by  a  public 
action  group  formed  by  the  Lapoinya  community.    The  group  wrote  letters  to 
politicians  and  newspapers,  sent  a  delegation  to  the  relevant  Minister  and 
distributed information amongst local residents. 

 
The  second  plaintiff,  Ms  Jessica  Hoyt,  grew  up  in  Lapoinya  and  was  a 
founding member of the public action group referred to above.  The first plaintiff, 
Dr Bob  Brown,  was  formerly  a  Senator  for  Tasmania  and  a  founding  member 
and  leader  of  the  Australian  Greens.    He  has  been  involved  in  environmental 
campaigns and protests since the 1970s. 

 
On  the  first  occasion  Ms Hoyt  was  present  in  the  Lapoinya  Forest,  she 
entered  the  Lapoinya  Forest  at  Broxhams  Road,  passing  the  signs  referred  to 
above.    She  walked  through  the  forest  to  Maynes  Road.    An  employee  of 
Forestry Tasmania asked her to wait whilst an excavator moved away, to which 
request  she  acceded.    Ms Hoyt  then  walked  to  a  point  in  the  forest  on  the 
south western side of Maynes Road where she received a direction from a police 
officer  to  leave  the  area.    When  she  refused  to  do  so  she  was  removed  to  the 
junction of Maynes Road and Lapoinya Road. 

 
The following day Ms Hoyt returned to the forest with other members of 
the  community  who  wished  to  protest  against  logging  in  the  coupe,  in  order  to 
show them what had taken place.  She was walking some five to ten metres from, 
and to the south of, Maynes Road when she was instructed by a police officer to 
stop, which she did.  She was then arrested and taken to Maynes Road. 

On  the  date  the  subject  of  the  charge  against  him,  Dr Brown  entered 
 
Broxhams  Road  and  walked  along  a  section  of  it  with  three  other  persons.    He 
was  then  filmed  speaking  about  environmental  issues  and  calling  upon  the 
relevant  Minister  to  protect  the  forest  against  a  background  which  showed 
preparatory  work  for  logging  being  undertaken.    The  footage  included  works 
being undertaken by a bulldozer.  When Dr Brown was approached by two police 
officers  he  was  standing  on  a  cleared  part  of  Broxhams  Road  which  was  in  the 
Reserve.  After a conversation with  one of the officers he was directed to leave 
the area.  When he failed to do so, he was arrested. 

 
After the commencement of this proceeding by Dr Brown, the defendant, 
the State of Tasmania, decided not to pursue the charge made against him under 
the  Protesters  Act.    Likewise,  after  Ms  Hoyt  had  applied  to  be  joined  to  this 
proceeding, it was decided not to pursue the charges made against her.  Tasmania 
now  accepts  that  Dr  Brown  was  not  within  an  area  to  which  the  Protesters  Act

applied when  he  was arrested and does  not allege that Ms Hoyt was  in such an 
area, even though she contends that she was.

These matters may be put to one side for present purposes.  They assume 
more  importance  with  respect  to  difficulties  relating  to  the  identification  of 
""forestry  land""  to  which  the  Protesters  Act  applies  than  they  do  with  respect  to 
the  question  of  the  plaintiffs'  standing,  which  Tasmania  now  concedes.    That 
concession  is  appropriate.    Standing  is  not  lost  because  charges  are  withdrawn 
after the exercise of powers under a statute.  As Dixon CJ observed11 in Wragg v 
State of New South Wales12, what has been done may be repeated.  Furthermore, 
the plaintiffs have a ""real interest"" in the question of the validity of the Protesters 
Act  because,  unless  constrained  by  it,  the  plaintiffs  intend  to  engage  in  conduct 
which  it  proscribes.    They  are  therefore  interested  to  know  whether  they  are 
required to observe the law13. 

The background to the Protesters Act 

The FMA, access and powers 

 
When  the  Protesters  Act  was  enacted,  the  FMA  and  its  predecessor 
statutes  had  been  in  operation  for  some  time.    The  FMA  provides  Forestry 
Tasmania,  its  authorised  officers  and  police  officers  with  powers  to  ensure  that 
forest management and operations, with which Forestry Tasmania is charged, are 
not impeded.  It contains provisions with respect to public access to  PTPZ land.  
There is no suggestion that there  have been any  real difficulties associated with 
its  operation.    The  validity  of  its  relevant  provisions  is  not  questioned  in  these 
proceedings. 

As  Forest  Manager  under  the  FMA14,  Forestry  Tasmania  has  functions 
 
which  include  the  management  and  control  of  all  PTPZ  land  in  Tasmania, 
including  forest  operations  on  that  land  for  the  purposes  of  selling  forest 
products15.

Section 13(1) of the FMA provides: 

6. 

""The  Forest  Manager  must  perform  its  functions  and  exercise  its  powers 
so  as  to  allow  access  to  permanent  timber  production  zone  land  for  such 
purposes  as  are  not  incompatible  with  the  management  of  permanent 
timber production zone land under this Act."" 

21 

22 

23 

A  similar  provision  was  introduced  in  1991  as  s 20B(1)  of  the  statute 
 
which  preceded  the  FMA,  the  Forestry  Act  1920  (Tas),  which  was  concerned 
with the functions of the Forestry Commission16: 

""The Commission must exercise its powers so as to afford members of the 
public  access  to  State  forest  for  such  recreational  purposes  as  are  not 
incompatible with the management of State forest under this Act."" 

The  original  s  20B,  which  had  been  inserted  in  1984,  was  in  somewhat 

 
different terms17: 

""The  Minister  may  ...  by  notice  in  the  Gazette,  declare  an  area  of  State 
forest to be an area into which persons may not enter and in which persons 
may not remain without the authorization in writing of the Commission."" 

It would appear from the Second Reading Speech to the 1984 Amendment 
 
Bill that it was thought necessary to include such a provision because the existing 
legislation  was 
to  deal  with  situations  arising  from  recent 
demonstrations.    The  demonstrations  referred  to  were  those  relating  to  the 
construction of the Franklin Dam18.  It was said that19: 

inadequate 

""[t]he  effect  of  the  bill  is  to  amend  the  Forestry  Act  to  provide  for  a 
situation  of  trespass.    The  powers  of  arrest  which  follow  from  the 
amendment  will  enable  the  removal  of  person  or  persons  causing  the 
problem or the obstruction in the forests.""

The  inference  presently  to  be  drawn  from  the  original  s 20B  is  that  the 
 
Tasmanian  Parliament  considered  it  to  be  necessary  to  make  express  provision 
for notifying the public when they might not access forest areas.  That provision, 
like  the  later  s 20B(1)  and  the  current  s 13(1),  recognises  that  there  is  an 
expectation  on  the  part  of  the  public  in  Tasmania,  residents  and  visitors  alike, 
that  they  may  access  forest  areas  and  that  that  expectation  should,  so  far  as 
reasonably practicable, be met.

said20: 

In the Second Reading Speech to the Bill which became the FMA it was 

""Under this bill the people of Tasmania will still be able to access 
and use permanent timber production zone land for the range of purposes 
and  activities  they  currently  enjoy  and  undertake  in  their  public  forest 
estate.    The  provisions  of  the  1920  [A]ct  are  essentially  maintained  to 
ensure the right to access the land continue, so long as the access does not 
interfere with the management of the land."" 

26 

27 

28 

29 

Forestry  Tasmania  accepts  many  activities  to  be  compatible  with  its 
 
strategic objectives with respect to PTPZ land.  In the FPP concerning the forest 
operations here in question, it is said that such activities include ""recreation sites, 
organised  events,  recreational  vehicle  use,  hunting  and  firearm  use,  fossicking 
and  prospecting,  firewood  collection,  indigenous  rights  use,  commercial  or 
private access, apiary sites, mineral exploration and mining and tourism"". 

The access recognised as available to the public by s 13(1) of the FMA is 
 
qualified  by  s  13(2),  which  provides  that  nothing  said  in  s 13(1)  prevents  the 
Forest Manager from exercising its powers under ss 21, 22 and 23. 

Section 21(1)  provides  that  the  Forest  Manager  may  erect  signs  on  or  in 
 
respect  of  forest  roads  or  on  PTPZ  land  for  the  purposes  of  discharging  its 
responsibilities  or  in  the  interests  of  safety.    Section  21(2)  provides  that  it  is  to 
erect signs stating that a particular road is a ""forest road"" within the meaning of 
the  FMA.    By  s 21(3)  a  person  must  not,  without  lawful  excuse,  undertake  an 
activity or engage in conduct on a forest road or other land in PTPZ land contrary 
to  the  direction  of  the  Forest  Manager  as  expressed  on  a  sign  authorised  by  the 
Forest Manager. 

 
The  Forest  Manager,  under  s 22(2),  may  appoint  an  employee  to  be  an 
authorised officer.  An authorised officer may, under s 22(3), request a person not

to  enter  PTPZ  land  or  a  forest  road,  to  leave  that  land  or  road  or  to  cease  to 
undertake an activity or engage in conduct on them.  The request may be made if 
the authorised officer is of the opinion that the entry or presence of that person, 
activity conducted or conduct engaged in may prevent the Forest Manager from 
effectively  or  efficiently  performing  its  functions.    An  authorised  officer  may 
also,  under  s 22(4),  prohibit  a  person  from  entering,  or  remaining  in,  an  area  of 
PTPZ land in particular circumstances, including when it is in the interests of the 
person's safety. 

 
Section 23(2) provides that the Forest Manager may close a forest road or 
any section thereof, either permanently or temporarily, to all traffic if it considers 
that  closure  is  necessary  or  expedient  for  the  purposes  of  discharging  its 
responsibilities or in the interests of safety.  Closure may be signified or effected 
by  signage  or  signage  in  conjunction  with  barricades  or  trenches  or  any 
combination  of  them.    Section 23(4)  provides  that  a  person  must  not  drive  a 
vehicle on or otherwise use a forest road that has been closed in accordance with 
the section. 

Sections 21 and 22 also provide for action to be taken by police officers.  
 
Section  21(5)  provides  that  a  police  officer  who  reasonably  considers  that  a 
person is offending against s 21(3) may direct the person to leave the forest road 
or  other  land  in  PTPZ  land.    Section 21(6)  requires  a  person  given  such  a 
direction  to  comply  with  it.    Section 22(6)  provides  that  a  person  must  not, 
without lawful excuse, undertake an activity or engage in conduct on PTPZ land 
or a forest road contrary  to the directions  of a police  officer.   The  penalty for a 
contravention of each of ss 21, 22 and 23 is a fine not exceeding 20 penalty units, 
which  currently  amounts  to  $3,180.    Further,  under  ss 21(7)  and  22(7),  a  police 
officer  may  arrest  a  person  who  fails  to  comply  with  a  direction  given  under 
ss 21(5) and 22(6). 

Protests and the Protesters Act 

including  protests  concerning  environmental 

The  parties  agree  that  there  is  a  long  history  of  political  protests  in 
 
Australia, 
in  spaces 
accessible to the public and on Crown land.  In Dr Brown's experience, which is 
stated in the Special Case, the primary means of bringing environmental issues to 
the attention of the public and politicians is to broadcast images, including by the 
use  of  social  media,  of  that  part  of  the  environment  sought  to  be  protected  and 
which is said to be threatened. 

issues, 

 
The parties agree that, historically, protests have been a means of bringing 
about  political  and  legislative  change  on  environmental  issues.    Onsite  protests 
have  been  a  catalyst  for  granting  protection  to  the  environment  in  particular 
places  and  have  contributed  to  governments  in  Tasmania  and  throughout

Australia  granting  legislative  and  regulatory  environmental  protection  to  areas 
not  previously  protected.    Since  2006,  some  37  protests  have  taken  place  in 
Tasmania in areas that, at some later time, have been provided with legislative or 
regulatory protection. 

 
It  is  accepted  that  public  debate  about  environmental  issues  generally  is 
relevant  to  both  State  and  federal  politics.    Public  debate  about  environmental 
issues in Tasmania has featured prominently in previous federal campaigns. 

 
It is an agreed fact that some protests have involved blocking the entry of 
machinery  to  forests  and  interfering  with  tree  felling  activities.    Protest  activity 
has included protesters placing themselves so as to render tree felling impossible.  
Prior to the enactment of the Protesters Act, there were prosecutions of protesters 
who had prevented equipment being used in forest operations; locked themselves 
to  a  boom  gate  and  a  vehicle;  occupied  tree  houses;  blocked  forest  roads;  and 
locked themselves onto various devices whilst sitting in trees in order to prevent 
themselves being removed from the area. 

A  ""Fact  Sheet""  was  prepared  with  respect  to  the  Workplaces  (Protection 
 
From  Protesters)  Bill  2014  (Tas)  (""the  Protesters  Bill"").    It  is  a  document 
provided to members of the Tasmanian Parliament for the purpose of debate and 
is  said  to  be  capable  of  constituting  extrinsic  material  for  the  purpose  of 
s 8B(3)(e)  of  the  Acts  Interpretation  Act  1931  (Tas).    The  Protesters  Bill  is 
referred  to  in  the  Fact  Sheet  as  ""designed  to  implement  the  Tasmanian 
Government's  election  policy  commitment  to  introduce  new  laws  to  address 
illegal  protest  action  in  Tasmanian  workplaces"".    It  says  that  the  Bill  creates 
indictable offences but does not seek to prohibit the right to peaceful protests.  It 
says that it ""does seek to regulate inappropriate protest activity that impedes the 
ability  of  businesses  to  lawfully  generate  wealth  and  create  jobs"".    The  Bill  is 
said  to  send  ""a  strong  message  to  protest  groups  that  intentionally  disruptive 
protest  action  that  prevents  or  hinders  lawful  business  activity  is  not  acceptable 
to the broader Tasmanian community"". 

 
It is not suggested that the plaintiffs were engaged in protest action of the 
kind referred to above.  It is not explained how the relevant police officer came to 
the  view  that  the  presence  of  the  plaintiffs  could  have  the  effect  of  preventing, 
hindering  or  obstructing  forest  operations,  as  the  Protesters  Act  requires.    It  is, 
however,  to  be  inferred  from  the  conversation  that  one  police  officer  had  with 
Dr Brown  (which  will  be  referred  to  later  in  these  reasons)  that  it  was  thought 
that Dr Brown was on land which was ""business premises"" or a ""business access 
area""  to  which  the  Act  applied.    The  charges  against  Ms Hoyt  under  the 
Protesters  Act  must  necessarily  have  been  based  on  the  same  assumption.    The 
uncertainty  created  by  these  terms  is  an  important  aspect  of  the  operation  and 
effect of the provisions of the Protesters Act, as will be explained.

The provisions of the Protesters Act 

10. 

The prohibitions in s 6 

38 

39 

 
The  prohibitions  which  are  central  to  the  Protesters  Act  are  contained  in 
ss 6  and  7  of  the  Act.    The  plaintiffs  direct  attention  to  s 6  and  its  associated 
provisions, namely, ss 7, 8, 11 and 13 and Pt 4 of the Act. 

 
Section 7  prohibits  protesters  from  doing  acts  which  cause  damage  to 
business  premises  or  a  ""business-related  object""  and  it  prohibits  threats  of 
damage in relation to business premises for the purpose of promoting awareness 
of  or  support  for  an  opinion  or  belief  in  respect  of  political,  environmental  or 
other  issues.    Section  7  is  not  engaged  on  the  facts  of  the  Special  Case  and  no 
substantial argument was addressed to it.  Save for the question of the purpose of 
the Protesters Act, to which s 7 may be relevant, it will not be further considered 
with respect to the principal question on the Special Case. 

40 

 

Section 6(1) to (3) provide: 

""(1)  A protester must not enter business premises, or a part of business 

premises, if – 

(a) 

(b) 

entering  the  business  premises  or  the  part,  or  remaining  on 
the  premises  or  part  after  entry,  prevents,  hinders  or 
obstructs  the  carrying  out  of  a  business  activity  on  the 
premises by  a business occupier in relation  to the premises; 
and 

the  protester  knows,  or  ought  reasonably  to  be  expected  to 
know, that his or her entry or remaining is likely to prevent, 
hinder  or  obstruct  the  carrying  out  of  a  business  activity  on 
the  premises  by  a  business  occupier  in  relation  to  the 
premises. 

(2)  A  protester  must  not  do  an  act  on  business  premises,  or  on  a 

business access area in relation to business premises, if – 

(a) 

(b) 

the  act  prevents,  hinders  or  obstructs  the  carrying  out  of  a 
business  activity  on  the  premises  by  a  business  occupier  in 
relation to the premises; and 

the  protester  knows,  or  ought  reasonably  to  be  expected  to 
know, that the act is likely to prevent, hinder or obstruct the 
carrying  out  of  a  business  activity  on  the  premises  by  a 
business occupier in relation to the premises.

(3)  A  protester  must  not  do  an  act  that  prevents,  hinders,  or  obstructs 
access,  by  a  business  occupier  in  relation  to  the  premises,  to  an 
entrance to, or to an exit from – 

(a) 

business premises; or 

(b) 

a business access area in relation to business premises – 

if the protester knows, or ought reasonably to be expected to know, 
that the act is likely to prevent, hinder or obstruct such access."" 

A ""business activity"" is defined, inter alia, as a lawful activity carried out 

 
for the purposes of profit or by a Government Business Enterprise21. 

 
Section 6(7)  provides  that  an  act  ""prevents,  hinders  or  obstructs  the 
carrying  out  of  a  business  activity  on  the  business  premises  by  a  business 
occupier"" if the act: 

""(a) 

prevents,  hinders  or  obstructs  the  use,  by  a  business  occupier  in 
relation to the business premises, of a business-related object on the 
business premises; or 

(b) 

causes a risk to the safety of a business occupier in relation to the 
business premises."" 

The definitions of a ""protester"" and of ""protest activity"" have been referred 

 
to at the outset of these reasons. 

""Business premises"" and ""business access areas"" 

 
The  term  ""business  premises""  does  not  evoke  images  of forest  lands,  but 
the scheme  of the Protesters Act applies that  definition to places where protests 
might  affect  activities  which  involve  economic  interests,  including  those  of  a 
Government Business Enterprise such as Forestry Tasmania22. 

 
The term ""business premises"" is defined relevantly to mean premises that 
are  ""forestry  land""23.    ""Forestry  land""  is  defined  relevantly  to  mean  ""an  area  of

land on which forest operations are being carried out""24.  ""Forest operations"" are 
defined  widely  to  mean  work  comprised  of,  or  connected  with,  seeding  and 
planting  trees;  managing  trees  prior  to  harvest;  or  harvesting,  extracting  or 
quarrying  forest  products,  and  includes  any  related  land  clearing,  land 
preparation, burning-off or access construction25. 

46 

 

A ""business access area"" is relevantly defined to mean26: 

""so  much  of  an  area  of  land  (including  but  not  limited  to  any  road, 
footpath  or  public  place),  that  is  outside  the  business  premises,  as  is 
reasonably necessary to enable access to an entrance to, or to an exit from, 
the business premises"". 

Directions and requirements 

47 

 
A contravention of s 6(1), (2) or (3) does not itself give rise to an offence, 
at least not in the first instance.  The relevant offences are provided for in ss 6(4) 
and  8(1).    They  require,  in  the  first  place,  that  a  direction  be  given  by  a  police 
officer under s 11 that a person leave business premises or a business access area 
without  delay.    For  the  offence  under  s  6(4),  the  requirement  referred  to  in 
s 11(6) must also be specified in the direction27. 

48 

 

Section 11(1) and (2) provide: 

""(1)  A police officer may direct a person who is on business premises to 
leave  the  premises  without  delay,  if  the  police  officer  reasonably 
believes  that  the  person  has  committed,  is  committing,  or  is  about 
to  commit,  an  offence,  against  a  provision  of  this  Act,  or  a 
contravention of section 6(1), (2) or (3), on or in relation to –

person  has  committed,  is  committing,  or  is  about  to  commit,  an 
offence,  against  a  provision  of  this  Act,  or  a  contravention  of 
section 6(1), (2) or (3), on or in relation to –

Section 11(6) provides: 

 

""A  direction  issued  under  this  section  to  a  person  may  include  a 
requirement  that  the  person  must  not,  in  the  period  of  3  months  after  the 
date on which the direction is issued – 

(a) 

commit an offence against a provision of this Act; or 

(b)  … contravene section 6(1), (2) or (3)."" 

50 

Section 11(7) provides that a direction may be issued to either a person or 
 
""a group of persons"" and s 11(8) provides that if a direction is given to a group of 
persons it is taken to have been issued to each person: 

""(a)  who is a member of the group to whom the direction is issued; and 

(b)  who ought reasonably to be expected to have heard the direction."" 

The offences:  s 6(4) and s 8(1) 

51 

 

It is necessary then to return to s 6(4), which is in these terms: 

""A  person  commits  an  offence  if  he  or  she  contravenes  a  requirement, 
specified  in  accordance  with  section  11(6)  on  a  direction  issued  to  the 
person under section 11(1) or (2), that the person must not, in the period of 
3  months  after  the  date  on  which  the  direction  is  issued,  contravene 
subsection (1), (2) or (3) of this section."" 

52 

An  offence  is  committed  under  s  6(4)  when  a  direction  is  given  under 
 
s 11(1) or (2) to leave forestry land, or the business access area in relation to it; 
that direction is accompanied by the requirement in s 11(6) that the protester not 
commit an offence under the Protesters Act or contravene s 6(1), (2) or (3) in a 
period  of  three  months  from  the  date  of  the  direction;  and  the  person  does

commit  an  offence  or  contravene  s 6(1),  (2)  or  (3)  in  that  period.    No  further 
direction is then necessary. 

14. 

53 

 
Section 6(4)  applies  to  both  ""business  premises""  which  is  forestry  land, 
and  ""business  access  areas"".    Section 8(1)  is  limited  in  its  terms  to  business 
access areas.  It provides that: 

""A person must not – 

(a) 

(b) 

remain  on  a  business  access  area  in  relation  to  business  premises 
after  having  been  directed  by  a  police  officer  under  section  11  to 
leave the business access area; or 

enter a business access area in relation to business premises within 
4  days  after  having  been  directed  by  a  police  officer  under 
section 11 to leave – 

(i) 

the business premises; or 

(ii) 

a business access area in relation to the business premises."" 

54

56 

to  remove 

An  offence  under  s 8(1)(a)  is  committed  where  a  person  fails  to  comply 
 
themselves  from  a  business  access  area.  
with  a  direction 
Section 8(1)(b)  invites  further  attention.    An  offence  is  here  committed  where  a 
person enters the business access area where  they received the s 11  direction  or 
enters a business access area in relation to business premises where they received 
such a direction, within four days of that direction.  The area that the person may 
not  enter  is  not  limited  to  the  area  where  the  person  was  at  the  time  of  the 
direction  but,  effectively,  includes  any  area  that  is  outside  the  ""forestry  land"" 
(namely,  the  area  in  which  forest  operations  are  then  being  conducted)  as  is 
reasonably  necessary  to  enable  access  to  an  entrance  to,  or  to  an  exit  from,  the 
forestry  land.    No  more  is  required  for  the  commission  of  an  offence  than  the 
person's presence in such an area in that period of time. 

 
Ms Hoyt received an infringement notice with respect to the first occasion 
on  which  she  was  present  in  a  part  of  the  Lapoinya  Forest.    It  specified  an 
offence under s 8(1).  The offence with which she was later charged, concerning 
the  second  occasion  she  was  present,  was  that  under  s 6(4).    Dr Brown  was 
charged with an offence under s 8(1).  Both plaintiffs were arrested under powers 
given to police officers by the Protesters Act. 

Powers of arrest and removal 

Section 13(1)  provides  that  a  police  officer  may  arrest  without  warrant  a 

 
person:
--------
""(a)  who is on business premises; and 

15. 

Kiefel

CJ 
J

(b)  who  the  police  officer  reasonably  believes  is  committing,  or  has 
committed  within  the  previous  3  months,  an  offence,  against  a 
provision of this Act, on or in relation to – 

 

 

(i) 

the business premises; or 

(ii) 

a business access area in relation to the business premises."" 

 
Section  13(2)  provides  the  same  powers  of  arrest  in  relation  to  a  person 
who  is  on  a  business  access  area.    A  police  officer  may  also  remove  a  person 
from business premises or a business access area if the police officer reasonably 
believes  that  the  person  is  committing  or  has  committed  an  offence  against  the 
Act, or a contravention of s 6(1), (2) or (3)28. 

 
The powers of arrest and removal are exercisable only if the police officer 
""reasonably  believes"" that it is necessary to do so for specified purposes, which 
include  ensuring  the  person's  attendance  at  court;  the  preservation  of  public 
order;  preventing  the  continuation  or  repetition  of  an  offence;  or  the  safety  and 
welfare of the person or members of the public29. 

Penalties 

The offences referred to above are indictable offences30 but may, with the 
 
consent  of  the  prosecutor,  be  heard  and  determined  by  a  court  of  summary 
jurisdiction31.    Relevantly,  for  an  offence  against  s  6(4)  or  s  8(1)  an  individual 
may be fined up to $5,000 by a court of summary jurisdiction and up to $10,000 
by other courts32.  A further offence against s 6(4) may involve, as an alternative 
to that penalty, a term of imprisonment, to a maximum of 12 months in the case

Where an infringement notice is issued to an individual by a police officer 
with  respect  to  an  offence  under  s 6(4)  or  s 8(1),  a  penalty  of  two  penalty  units 
($318) may be imposed on that individual34. 

The terms, operation and effect of the Protesters Act 

 
In  order  to  answer  the  question  whether  a  statute  impermissibly  burdens 
the  implied  freedom  of  political  communication,  it  is  necessary  to  consider  in 
some detail the operation and effect of the statute35.  That consideration assumes 
particular importance in this matter. 

 
An  obvious  feature  of  the  Protesters  Act  is  that  it  is  expressed  to  apply 
only  to  protesters.    Other  persons  who  might  be  present  on,  or  remain  on,  land 
where  forest  operations  are  taking  place  and  who  do  acts  which  affect  forest 
operations  in  the  ways  mentioned  in  s 6(1),  (2)  and  (3)  are  not  subject  to  the 
Protesters Act or its consequences.  The Protesters Act may be contrasted in this 
respect with the FMA, which applies to all persons. 

 
Another  feature  is  that  the  definition  of  ""protester""  in  the  Protesters  Act 
refers  expressly  to  matters  about  which  protesters  may  be  voicing  opinions.  
Those matters and opinions receive no further mention in the Act, the operative 
provisions  of  which  are  addressed  to  the  conduct  of  protesters  as  it  may  impact 
upon  forest  operations.    It  would  seem  that  protesters  are  identified  in  this  way 
because they, or some of them, are seen to be persons who are likely to engage in 
that conduct. 

It may be accepted that protesters will seek to conduct protests concerning 
 
forest  operations,  such  as  clearing  or  tree  felling,  in  the  vicinity  of  those 
operations.    The  plaintiffs  refer  to  protests  of  this  kind  generally  as  ""onsite 
protests"".  It is important, however, to recognise that protests will take different 
forms and some will occur much closer to forest operations than others.  The Fact 
Sheet  for  the  Protesters  Bill  itself  distinguishes  between  protests  which  are 
intentionally  disruptive  of  business  activity  and  peaceful  protests.    The  former

kind  of  protest  might  involve  physical  interaction  between  protesters  and 
machinery being used in forest operations, the physical presence of protesters in 
or around trees due to be felled, physical confrontations with Forestry Tasmania 
personnel and blocking access to forest operations. 

 
It  is  to  be  inferred  from  ss  6  and  7  that  the  Protesters  Act  is  directed  to 
protesters engaged in protests of that kind because it is the activities involved in 
such protests which are likely to damage or prevent, hinder or obstruct business 
activities  conducted  on  forestry  land.    Not  all  protests  can  be  assumed  to  be  of 
that  kind.    Indeed,  the  facts  in  the  Special  Case  do  not  suggest  that  activities 
resulting  in  such  damage  or  harm  have  been  common  occurrences  in  protest 
actions  which  have  been  conducted  over  many  years.    To  take  one  example 
similar to the facts of the Special Case, a protest may involve persons standing at 
a distance from, but within sight of, forest operations, holding placards, voicing 
their  protests  and  being  filmed.    Protesters  of  this  kind  are  also  likely  to  be 
affected by the exercise of powers under the Protesters Act. 

 
The powers given to police officers by the Protesters Act are conditioned 
upon a primary question of fact and law – whether a protester is in an area that is 
""business premises"", here forestry land, or a ""business access area"" with respect 
to  that  land.    This  question  must  be  addressed  when  a  police  officer  is 
considering  whether  to  direct  a  person  to  leave  an  area  under  s 11(1)  or  (2), 
whether a person has remained on or entered a business access area under s 8(1), 
whether  a  person  is  about  to  contravene  s 6(1),  (2)  or  (3)  or  commit  an  offence 
under s 6(4) and whether to remove or arrest a person under s 13. 

 
The  principal  problem,  practically  speaking,  for  both  police  officers 
exercising powers under the Protesters Act and protesters is that it will often not 
be  possible  to  determine  the  boundaries  of  ""business  premises""  or  a  ""business 
access area"".  That problem arises because the term ""business premises"" is inapt 
for use with respect to forestry land.  The definition of ""business premises"" with 
respect  to  forestry  land  does  not  provide  much  guidance.    The  question  simply 
becomes  whether  a  protester  is  in  an  area  of  land  on  which  forest  operations  (a 
widely  defined  term)  are  being  carried  out.    The  vagueness  of  the  definition  of 
""business access area"" compounds the problem. 

Forest  operations  might  involve  the  use  of  sheds  but  not  ""business 
 
premises""  as  that  term  is  ordinarily  understood.    Forest  operations  are  not 
conducted  in  premises  or  even  enclosures;  the  operations  will  not  be  located  at 
one  site,  because  they  will  be  carried  out  progressively  at  different  locations  in 
the harvest areas of the coupe.  There will be nothing to indicate the boundaries 
of these locations so that it is understood where a protester  may not be present.  
Forestry Tasmania may identify such areas by signs or by physical barriers under 
the powers given by the FMA, but the Protesters Act does not identify the areas

to which it applies as those designated under the FMA.  It makes no connection 
with the FMA in this regard at all. 

18. 

 
The boundaries of an FPP are surveyed.  They are marked by pink tape on 
vegetation or fixtures along the boundary, but these markings may not be visible 
to  a  person  in  a  forest  for  a  number  of  reasons.    In  any  event  they  do  not 
designate business premises, which will not comprise the whole area of the FPP, 
or even the harvest area within it, but a smaller area where forest operations are 
being conducted from time to time. 

 
It  may  be  possible  to  identify  as  an  area  on  which  forest  operations  are 
being carried out, and therefore as ""business premises"", the exact location where 
machinery is being used, or where trees are being felled, or where roads or tracks 
for access are being constructed.  Even in these cases, it may not  be possible to 
discern whether a protester standing some distance from these activities is within 
or outside of the area to which the Protesters Act is intended to apply. 

 
It might be thought that the consequences of the conduct of a protester, or 
of  their  presence,  which  are  sought  to  be  avoided  by  the  Protesters  Act,  might 
provide  some  guidance  as  to  the  identification  of  the  area  the  subject  of  the 
Protesters Act.  Tasmania's initial position was that the phrase ""prevents, hinders 
or  obstructs""  should  not  be  read  narrowly,  but  in  the  course  of  argument  it 
accepted  that  it  should  be  construed,  consistently  with  the  principle  of  legality 
and  s  3  of  the  Acts  Interpretation  Act  1931  (Tas)36,  so  as  to  apply  only  to  the 
conduct  or  presence  of  a  person  which  ""substantially""  or  ""seriously""  hinders  or 
obstructs business activities. 

 
The Protesters Act does not require a police officer, before exercising the 
powers it provides, to simply consider what the particular protest action involves 
and whether it is likely to have these effects upon business activities then being 
carried  out  on  forestry  land.    Had  it  done  so,  attention  would  undoubtedly  be 
directed to the kind of protest activity referred to earlier in these reasons, which 
is likely to have a direct, discernible impact upon those business activities.   

                                                                                                                                     
36   Section 3 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1931 (Tas) provides:  

""Every Act shall be read and construed subject to the limits of the legislative 
powers of the State and so as not to exceed such powers, to the intent that, 
where any enactment thereof, but for this provision, would be construed as 
being in excess of such powers, it shall nevertheless be a valid enactment to 
the extent to which it is not in excess of such powers.""

In each case the primary focus in determining whether the Protesters Act 
 
applies is upon where a protester is situated.  In this statutory scheme the further 
enquiries,  as  to  what  effects  a  protester's  presence  or  conduct  might  have  and 
their  foresight  of  those  effects,  are  of  secondary  importance.    In  many  cases  it 
will  be  difficult  for  a  police  officer  to  be  able  to  correctly  determine  where  a 
protester  is  situated  and  where  the  line  around  business  premises  and  business 
access areas is to be drawn.  A protester will be in no better position in making 
such  determinations.    But  the  powers  exercised  by  police  officers  under  the 
Protesters  Act  have  important  consequences  for  protesters  and  for  protests 
generally  and  experience  suggests  that  their  exercise  will  not  always  be  based 
upon a correct appreciation of whether the land in which a protester is situated is 
forestry  land  to  which  the  Protesters  Act  applies.    In  its  practical  operation,  the 
Protesters  Act  may  bring  protest  activity  to  an  end  upon  the  mistaken,  albeit 
reasonable, belief of a police officer, unless the protesters are disposed to resist a 
direction, and thereby risk a breach of the peace, in order to test the issue. 

 
There can be little doubt that the determination of whether a protester is in 
an area of forestry land has proved difficult for police officers exercising powers 
under the Protesters Act.  The circumstances surrounding the arrest of Dr Brown 
are revealing.  The point is not that the police officer was unaware that Dr Brown 
was  then  standing  on  the  Reserve,  to  which  Tasmania  now  concedes  the 
Protesters  Act  did  not  apply,  but  rather  that  he  was  addressing  the  question 
whether Dr Brown was present in an area where forest operations  could be  said 
to be carried out.  His enquiry of Dr Brown reflects the difficulty police officers, 
and protesters, will experience in determining where the line is to be drawn.  He 
asked:    ""Do  you  realise  you  are  getting  close  to  impinging  on  forestry 
operations?"" 

 
Information about the charges made under the Protesters Act, provided in 
the Special Case, is also illuminating.  Since the commencement of the Protesters 
Act  nine  people,  including  the  plaintiffs,  have  been  charged  under  it:    seven 
under s 8(1)(a) and two under s 6(4).  All charges were discontinued because the 
direction given was not correctly referable to ""business premises"" or a ""business 
access area"". 

 
This  accords  with  the  statement  made  by  the  Tasmanian  Police 
Commissioner  after  the  decision  was  made  not  to  proceed  with  the  charges 
against  Dr Brown.    The  Commissioner  explained  that  the  decision  was  based 
upon advice received from the Tasmanian  Director of Public Prosecutions,  who 
had  observed  that  ""it  was  difficult  for  police  officers  to  determine  whether  a 
person was in a business access area or on business premises"".  It is unlikely that 
the Director was referring to a difficulty in choosing between the two.

The  point  to  be  made  is  not  that  prosecutions  of  charges  made  under  the 
 
Protesters Act are unlikely to succeed, if they do proceed.  It is that the difficulty 
associated with identifying the area to which the Protesters Act applies in a given 
circumstance  is  likely  to  result  in  errors  being  made  except  in  the  clearest  of 
cases.    The  result  will  be  that  some  lawful  protests  will  be  prevented  or 
discontinued and protesters will be deterred from further protesting.  They will be 
deterred because it will come to be appreciated, if it is not already, that there is a 
real likelihood that if they are present on land in the vicinity of forest operations 
they  may  be  subjected  to  a  direction  to  leave  the  area  and  all  the  effects  which 
flow  from  such  a  direction  even  if  there  is  no  basis  in  law  for  the  direction 
because the area is not forestry land or a business access area in relation to that 
land. 

 
The  vagueness  of  the  terms  ""business  premises""  and  ""business  access 
area"" is also likely to work against a protester in seeking a remedy by means of 
judicial review of a direction made to leave the area where they were protesting.  
It is one thing for lawyers advising the government to  determine whether it can 
be proved that a protester was in an area to which the Protesters Act applied.  It is 
another  for  protesters  to  have  a  direction  ruled  unlawful  in  time  to  return  to 
continue their protest.  The result will be  that protests will be stifled when  they 
should not be. 

 
The foregoing observations reflect experience of the practical operation of 
the  Protesters  Act  in  relation  to  forestry  land.    That  the  Protesters  Act  may 
operate effectively to stifle political communication which it is not the purpose of 
the Act to stifle is not merely a function of the vagaries of the application of the 
concepts employed by the legislation to ""facts on the ground""; it is a consequence 
of  the  design  of  the  Act  in  its  deployment  of  a  possibly  mistaken,  albeit 
reasonable,  belief  of  a  police  officer  as  the  mechanism  by  which  it  operates.  
Protests may be effectively terminated in circumstances where it is not necessary 
that the protester has, in truth, contravened s 6(1), (2) or (3) of the Protesters Act, 
where it is not necessary to establish that any offence has been committed by the 
protester,  and  where  judicial  review  of  the  mechanism  whereby  such  a  result  is 
brought about is not practically possible before the protest is terminated. 

 
In  this  regard,  the  directions  contemplated  by  s 11  may  be  based  on  a 
mistaken, albeit reasonable, belief on the part of a police officer that a person has 
committed,  is  committing  or  is  about  to  commit,  inter  alia,  a  contravention  of 
s 6(1), (2) or (3) on or in relation to business premises or a business access area.  
A protester who, in truth, has not committed, is not committing and is not about 
to  commit  a  contravention  of  s 6(1),  (2)  or  (3)  on  or  in  relation  to  business 
premises or a business access area may be directed to leave an area which is not, 
in truth, business premises or a business access area.  In this way, protesters who 
are  not  disposed  to  risk  breaching  the  peace  in  order  to  test  in  court  the

reasonableness of the police officer's possibly mistaken belief may be moved on 
by the police, and their protest thereby terminated. 

21. 

 
Section  8(1)(b)  requires  special  attention.    Together  with  s  13,  it  permits 
protesters  to  be  physically  removed  and  arrested  without  warrant  if  they  are 
present  in  any  ""business  access  area"",  wherever  that  is  thought  to  be,  in  the 
period of four days after they were directed to leave the area they were in when 
they were given the direction.  They may be guilty of an offence and liable to a 
substantial penalty.  This provision operates in that period to deter a person from 
being present in the area where they were present when given the direction under 
s 11(1)  or  (2),  and  also  from  being  present  in  any  ""business  access  area""  at  all 
with  respect  to  the  relevant  forestry  land,  with  all  the  vagueness  that  that  term 
implies.  The area of forest operations may have moved as work within the coupe 
is carried out.  Importantly, the offence with which the person may be charged is 
not  based  upon  any  foresight  on  the  part  of  a  police  officer  that  the  person's 
presence  might  have  an  adverse  effect  on  forest  operations.    The  person's 
presence  in  a  business  access  area  alone  is  sufficient  for  the  offence  to  be 
committed. 

 
The  effect  of  these  provisions  should  also  be  understood  in  light  of  their 
operation  in  conjunction  with  s  11(7)  and  (8).    It  will  be  recalled  that  under 
s 11(7),  a  direction  under  s  11(1)  or  (2)  may  be  given  to  a  group  of  persons, 
which, according to s 11(8), is taken to have been given to each person who is a 
member of the group and who ought reasonably to be expected to have heard the 
direction.    The  effect  of  s  11(7)  and  (8)  is  therefore  to  widen  the  effect  of 
deterrence and to stifle the protest of a potentially large number of persons.  All 
persons  present  in  an  area  and  within  earshot  of  a  direction  given  by  a  police 
officer, which may include by loudspeaker, will have to leave the area.  They will 
be  subject  to  s 8(1)  even  if  most,  or  all,  of  the  group  are  not  undertaking  any 
activity  which  might  amount  to  a  contravention  of  s  6(1),  (2)  or  (3).    A  police 
officer is not required to even consider that prospect. 

Where a requirement under s 11(6) is added to a direction under s 11(1) or 
 
(2), a person will be guilty of an offence under s 6(4) if they are considered by a 
police officer to contravene s 6(1), (2) or (3) in a period of three months from the 
time  the  direction  is  given.    That  consideration  will  be  subject  to  the  same 
vagaries about where the person is located as have been referred to above. 

 
In  summary,  an  exercise  of  the  powers  given  under  s 11(1)  and  (2)  in 
combination with s 6(1), (2) and (3); the offences created under s 8(1) and s 6(4) 
(the latter in combination with s 11(6) and s 6(1), (2) and (3)); and the powers of 
arrest  and  removal  given  by  s 13,  are  likely  to  have  significant  deterrent  effects 
on  protesters.    Their  effects  will  extend  to  protesters  undertaking  protest 
activities  of  a  kind  and  in  a  place  which  would  not  affect forest  operations  and

whose  presence  would  not  be  excluded  by  the  FMA.    Their  effects  will  extend 
beyond individual protesters to entire groups, because of the operation of s 11(7) 
and (8). 

 
Protesters  of  this  kind  will  be  deterred  from  being  present  in  the  vicinity 
of forest operations for fear that they may be subject to a direction to leave, with 
all  the  consequences  which  flow  from  such  a  direction.    They  will  be  deterred 
from protesting even though the direction may be based upon an erroneous view 
of where they are situated. 

 
The combined effect of the provisions referred to above is immediate.  It 
can  bring  the  protest  of  an  entire  group  of  persons  to  a  halt  and  its  effect  will 
extend  over  time.    Protesters  will  be  deterred  from  returning  to  areas  around 
forest  operations  for  days  and  even  months.    During  this  time  the  operations 
about which they seek to protest will continue but their voices will not be heard. 

 
The  possibility  that  a  protester  might  be  liable  to  a  substantial  penalty 
should  not  be  overlooked,  but  it  may  not  loom  so  largely  as  a  deterrent.    This 
may  be  because  no  charge  under  the  Protesters  Act  has  been  successfully 
prosecuted.    There  has  been  no  successful  prosecution  for  the  reason  that 
mistakes  have  been  made  about  whether  the  Protesters  Act  applied.    However, 
from the point of view of protesters, there is nothing to suggest that mistakes will 
not  continue  to  be  made.    That  circumstance  will  operate  as  a  significant 
deterrent.  That will occur as a practical matter whether or not a prosecution for 
an offence is pursued to a successful conclusion and without any occasion for the 
determination by a court of whether or not the operation of provisions infringes 
the implied freedom in the circumstances of the case37. 

A burden on the freedom? 

 
It is necessary to keep firmly in mind that the implied freedom is essential 
to  the  maintenance  of  the  system  of  representative  and  responsible  government 
for  which  the  Constitution  provides.    The  implied  freedom  protects  the  free 
expression of political opinion, including peaceful protest, which is indispensable 
to  the  exercise  of  political  sovereignty  by  the  people  of  the  Commonwealth.    It 
operates as a limit on the exercise of legislative power to impede that freedom of 
expression.  The enquiries posed by Lange are the indispensable means by which 
a  legislative  measure  which  is  apt  to  impede  the  free  flow  of  political

communications may be justified.  The first enquiry is whether the freedom is in 
fact burdened. 

23. 

 
Tasmania  does  not  dispute  that  protesters  to  whom  the  Protesters  Act 
applies  may  be  taken  to  communicate  about  matters  relating  to  politics  or 
government.  It concedes that the Protesters Act may burden the freedom.  It does 
not accept that the Protesters Act has that effect with respect to the plaintiffs, for 
it  did  not  apply  to  them  or  persons  in  their  position  who  were  protesting  on 
public land adjacent to a site on which a business activity was being undertaken.  
Tasmania says the Protesters Act therefore had no relevant operation.  It may be 
accepted that Dr Brown was on the Reserve, which was land to which Tasmania 
conceded the Protesters Act did not apply, but Tasmania did not explain how that 
conclusion was to be reached with respect to where Ms Hoyt was situated.  

 
Where  a  statute  is  said  to  impermissibly  burden  the  freedom,  the  first 
enquiry  is  whether  the  statute  in  fact  burdens  the  freedom38.    The  extent  of  the 
burden  is  a  matter  which  falls  to  be  considered  in  relation  to  the  assessments 
required by the second limb of Lange39.  The first enquiry requires consideration 
as  to  how  the  statute  affects  the  freedom  generally40.    It  is  not  answered  by 
reference  to  the  operation  of  the  statute  in  individual  cases,  although  such 
evidence  may  provide  useful  examples  of  the  statute's  practical  effect,  and 
therefore  of  the  burden  the  statute  may  have  on  the  freedom41.    This  Court  has 
said  more  than  once42  that  the  freedom  spoken  of  is  not  a  personal  right  or

freedom.    The  freedom  is  better  understood  as  affecting  communication  on  the 
subjects of politics and government more generally and as effecting a restriction 
on legislative power which burdens communications on those subjects43. 

 
In  any  event,  Tasmania's  argument  that,  with  respect  to  the  facts  of  the 
present case, it is not shown that the freedom is effectively burdened should not 
be  accepted.    The  circumstances  relating  to  the  plaintiffs  show  clearly  how  the 
freedom is burdened.  Even if the plaintiffs were not on business premises or in a 
business  access  area  the  police  officers  who  arrested  and  removed  them  were 
unable  to  correctly  determine  whether  they  were  on  those  premises  or  in  that 
area.  As a result of their error the plaintiffs' protests and their communications to 
others about the forest operations were silenced. 

 
The  other  aspect  of  the  Protesters  Act  to  be  considered  is  its 
discriminatory effect, namely, that it imposes a burden on the freedom solely in 
relation  to  protesters.    No  decision  of  this  Court  holds  that  a  law  effecting  a 
discriminatory burden is, for that reason alone, invalid and the plaintiffs did not 
contend for such an approach.  Such an approach would seem to be at odds with 
the  questions  posed  by  Lange  and,  in  particular,  the  second,  which  involves  an 
enquiry as to whether the burden can be justified.  

In  Australian  Capital  Television  Pty  Ltd  v  The  Commonwealth44 
 
(""ACTV""), Mason CJ held45 that some provisions of the statute in question were 
discriminatory  because  they  were  weighted  in  favour  of  established  political 
parties and against new and independent candidates.  His Honour did not say that 
they were invalid simply because they effected a discriminatory burden.  Rather, 
his  Honour  held  them  not  to  be  ""justified  or  legitimate""  after  considering,  and 
rejecting,  arguments  about  whether  the  regulatory  regime  introduced  a  ""level 
playing  field""  and  whether  equality  in  sharing  free  broadcasting  time  was 
unattainable.

A  law  effecting  a  discriminatory  burden  on  the  freedom  does  not 
 
necessarily effect a greater burden on the freedom.  It may effect a discriminatory 
burden  but  impose  only  a  slight,  or  a  less  than  substantial,  burden  on  the 
freedom.    McCloy  provides  an  example  of  such  a  law.    The  provisions  of  the 
statute there in question included provisions prohibiting the making or accepting 
of  a  political  donation  by  a  ""prohibited  donor"",  where  the  definition  of 
""prohibited donor"" singled out certain groups, such as property developers.  The 
provisions  were  not  considered  to  effect  a  substantial  burden  on  the  freedom 
because  their  effect  was  indirect,  given  that  their  direct  effect  was  to  enhance 
freedom  of  political  speech  generally  by  levelling  the  playing  field,  and  there 
were many other available methods of communicating on matters of politics and 
government, including influencing politicians to a point of view46.   

 
A  discriminatory  law  does,  however,  serve  to  identify  the  group  targeted 
by a law and informs the assessment of the restrictions imposed by the law upon 
the  ability  of  those  persons  to  communicate  on  matters  of  politics  and 
government.  It is this assessment which must be undertaken in order to answer 
the question whether the freedom is burdened.  In the present case the answer is 
clear.    Protesters  will  be  deterred  from  voicing  their  protests  with  respect  to 
forest operations.  The freedom is burdened. 

The purpose of the Protesters Act 

 
Once  it  is  concluded  that  the  freedom  is  burdened  by  a  statute,  the  true 
purpose of that statute assumes importance with respect to each of the enquiries 
which  follow,  which  are  directed  to  whether  the  burden  is  justified.    The 
identification  of  that  purpose  is  to  be  arrived  at  by  the  ordinary  processes  of 
construction47. 

The  plaintiffs  submit  that  the  purpose  and  practical  operation  of  s 6  and 
 
associated  provisions  is  to  ""prevent  onsite  protests  that  ...  relate  to  'political, 
environmental,  social,  cultural  or  economic  issues',  which  are  the  key  issues  to 
which  electors  will  have  regard  when  choosing  their  representatives""  and  to 
""prevent, hinder or obstruct, or be about to prevent, hinder or obstruct, business 
activities at the site where private or governmental entities carry on business"". 

For  its  part,  Tasmania  says  that  the  purpose  of  the  Protesters  Act  is  to 
 
""prevent  people  from  damaging  or  threatening  to  damage  real  or  personal 
property  connected  with  a  business;  to  ensure  that  protesters  do  not  impede,

hinder  or  obstruct  the  carrying  out  of  lawful  business  activity  on  business 
premises or business access areas; and to protect business operators going about 
their  business  safely  and  without  disruption.    The  objects  of  the  Act  are 
connected  with  the  advantage  of  having  a  settled  and  orderly  economic 
environment in which to conduct business."" 

 
The  purpose  of  the  Protesters  Act  is  most  clearly  discerned  from  the 
sections which contain the relevant prohibitions, ss 6 and 7.  Those provisions are 
directed towards the harm that the conduct of particular kinds of protest activities 
may  cause.    They  are  directed  to  conduct  which  may  cause  damage  to  the 
property  of  a  business  or  disrupt  its  activities.    They  are  directed  towards 
protesters because protesters are seen as the potential source of such harm.  It is 
not to be inferred that the purpose of the Act is to deter protesters more generally, 
even if that is the effect of some of the measures it employs in seeking to achieve 
its purpose of prevention of damage to and disruption of forest operations. 

 
The plaintiffs' submissions elide the purpose of the Protesters Act with its 
operation  and  effect.    In  a  later  submission  they  recognise  that  it  is  the  Act's 
operation  in  respect  of  onsite  environmental  protests  which  will  stultify  the 
effectiveness  of  protests.    It  is  the  measures  for  which  the  Act  provides,  and  in 
particular  the  powers  given  to  police,  which  affect  the  ability  of  persons  to 
protest.  But this is not to deny that those measures are directed to the protections 
it seeks to achieve. 

 
Although  protesters  are  targeted  and  discriminated  against  and  special 
measures  are  directed  towards  them,  it  may  be  seen  that  the  legislation  was 
enacted  against  a  background  where  protesters,  or  at  least  some  of  them,  were 
perceived  to  be  those  persons,  or  groups,  who  would  cause  damage  or  disrupt 
economic activities during protests of particular kinds.  It is important, however, 
to  be  clear  about  the  purpose  of  the  Protesters  Act.    It  is  not  correctly  stated 
simply as the protection of the interests of business just as it is not the prevention 
of  protests.    It  is  the  protection  of  businesses  and  their  operations,  here  forest 
operations,  from  damage  and  disruption  from  protesters  who  are  engaged  in 
particular kinds of protests.  This is the mischief to which the statute is directed48. 

Compatibility 

102 

In McCloy49 it was said that the process for the justification of the burden 
 
the  statute  places  on  the  freedom  commences  with  the  requirement,  stated  in

Lange50,  that  the  purpose  of  the  provisions  in  question  be  ""compatible  with  the 
maintenance  of  the  constitutionally  prescribed  system  of  representative  and 
responsible  government"".    Clearly  enough,  the  purpose  of  the  Protesters  Act, 
understood in the way described above, could not be said to be incompatible with 
the freedom.   

In  Coleman  v  Power51  it  was  said  that  the  adjectival  phrase  referred  to 
 
above  does  not  merely  qualify  the  ""legitimate  end"".    It  qualifies  the  compound 
conception  of  the  fulfilment  of  such  an  end.    That  is  to  say,  the  manner  of 
achieving the statute's purpose, as well as the purpose itself, must be compatible 
with the  maintenance  of the constitutionally  prescribed system  of representative 
and responsible government. 

 
In  its  submissions  in  this  matter  the  Commonwealth,  intervening,  drew 
attention  to  the  summary  version  of  this  requirement  of  the  Lange  test  which 
appears at the outset of the joint reasons in McCloy52.  The Commonwealth said 
that  it  may  be  understood  to  suggest  that  a  conclusion  as  to  whether  the  means 
adopted to achieve the statutory object are ""reasonably appropriate and adapted"" 
or  proportionate  to  a  legitimate  end  is  to  be  reached  at  a  point  before 
proportionality  testing  is  undertaken.    Clearly  the  statute's  purpose  must  be 
assessed  for  compatibility  with  the  constitutionally  prescribed  system  of 
government at this stage, but in practical terms the means adopted could not be.  
The point is well made.  The commencing words of Questions 2 and 3 stated in 
McCloy should read:

A slight burden? 

28. 

105 

106 

107 

108 

 
The  submission  that  Tasmania  puts  is  that  where  the  Protesters  Act  does 
effect  a  burden,  it  will  only  be  slight.    In  essence,  it  argues  that  in  most  cases 
protesters will not be able to lawfully be present in areas where forest operations 
are being carried out.  It does not say how these areas are to be identified. 

It  will  be  recalled  that  the  plaintiffs  claimed  that  there  is  a  need  for 
 
persons  to  be  able  to  make  ""onsite  protests""  in  those  parts  of  the  natural 
environment  which  are  considered  to  be  under  threat  of  damage  or  destruction.  
The  rationale  for  this  view  is  that  it  is  necessary  to  be  present  in  order  that 
images  of  forest  operations  together  with  protests  concerning  them  can  be 
communicated  to  the  public  at  large.    For  a  reason  not  explained,  images  taken 
by equipment such as drones flown overhead were not seen to be practicable, at 
least at present. 

 
The  plaintiffs  did  not  distinguish  between  protesters  whose  actions  may 
directly  affect  operations  and  those  simply  present  at  a  distance  from  those 
operations.    In  either  case  Tasmania  submits  that  persons  have  no  right  to  be 
""onsite"".    It  says  that  there  can  be  no  right  to  carry  out  protests  on  the  site  of  a 
business  activity  carried  out  by  a  business  occupier  in  lawful  possession  of 
premises who does not consent to the presence of protesters.  In such a situation a 
protester is a trespasser and the protester's activity on the property may amount to 
a nuisance, and in neither case does the freedom alter this state of affairs. 

Tasmania calls in aid the observations of McHugh J in Levy v  Victoria53.  
 
In that case, a regulation prohibited persons other than holders of game licences 
from  entering  upon  a  permitted  hunting  area  between  certain  hours  and  on 
specified  dates.    His  Honour  observed54  that  the  constitutional  implication  does 
not  create  rights  and  questioned  whether,  in  the  absence  of  the  regulations,  the 
protesters  had  the  right  to  be  present  in  the  permitted  hunting  area.    Unless  the 
common law or a statute gave them a right to enter the area, it might be said that 
the lack of that right, not the regulations, denied them the opportunity to protest.  
The  matter  was  taken  no  further  for,  as  his  Honour  went  on  to  explain,  the 
argument  for  the  parties  assumed  that,  in  the  absence  of  the  regulations,  the 
plaintiff and others were entitled to enter the area. 

109 

The  question  to  which  McHugh J  adverted  in  Levy  does  not  arise  in  this 
 
case.    As  has  been  seen,  the  Protesters  Act  may  operate  to  stifle  political

communication on the mistaken, albeit reasonable, belief of a police officer as to 
the effect of protest activity whether or not it involves the presence of protesters 
on  land  where  they  have  no  right  to  be  and  where  that  question  may  never  be 
determined  by  a  court.    As  will  be  explained  later  in  these  reasons,  it  is  in 
consequence  of  this  overreach  of  means  over  ends  that  the  Protesters  Act 
operates  more  widely  than  its  purpose  requires.    In  this  regard,  it  may  be 
contrasted  with  the  FMA.    It  may  be  accepted  to  be  logical  to  approach  the 
burden which a statute has on the freedom by reference to what protesters could 
do were it not for the statute.  But in the context of forestry land, as opposed to 
other  business  premises,  this  does  not  involve  questions  of  right  of  entry  or 
trespass,  unless  the  powers  of  the  FMA  are  invoked.    The  relevant  enquiry 
involves  a  comparison  between  the  effect  of  the  FMA  and  the  effect  of  the 
Protesters  Act  upon  the  ability  of  people  to  access  forest  areas  and  undertake 
protest activities on them. 

 
As  earlier  explained,  the  premise  of  the  FMA  is  that  persons  are  able  to 
access  forest  areas  unless  the  Forest  Manager  exercises  its  powers  to  exclude 
them.  The Forest Manager may only exercise those powers in order to perform 
its  functions  effectively  or  efficiently,  or  in  the  interests  of  safety.    It  is  not 
necessary  to  determine  the  nature  of  the  right  of  public  access  which  is 
recognised  by  the  FMA,  for  example,  whether  it  is  some  kind  of  conditional 
licence.  It is sufficient to appreciate that the scheme of the FMA is that persons 
will not be impeded in their access to forestry land or in their use of such land for 
any purpose so long as their presence or the activity which they undertake is not 
incompatible  with  the  management  of  the  forestry  land,  which  would  include 
forest operations conducted on that land.  It is difficult to comprehend that every 
form of protest will necessarily be incompatible with this purpose. 

 
The validity of the FMA is not challenged.  Under the FMA, persons may 
lawfully be excluded from certain areas of land or from roads from time to time 
and  this  will  be  so  even  if  a  person  wishes  to  be  in  the  area  in  order  to  make  a 
protest about what is taking place there.  The extent of the burden effected by the 
Protesters  Act  must  be  determined  having  regard  to  the  restrictions  already 
imposed on the freedom by the FMA. 

 
When  the  powers  under  the  FMA  are  exercised  for  the  purposes  of 
carrying out the Forest Manager's functions, the Forest Manager may be expected 
to designate an area at least in general terms.  The Forest Manager may do so via 
the  use  of  signs  and  physical  barriers.    This  may  be  contrasted  with  the 
ambiguous definitions of ""business premises"" and ""business access area"", which, 
it may be inferred, were intended to operate more widely.

were signs concerning road closures and chains were placed across the roads.  It 
may be assumed that the employee of Forestry Tasmania who requested Ms Hoyt 
to  remain  where  she  was  when  equipment  was  being  moved  was  a  person 
authorised under the FMA.  However, neither plaintiff was requested to leave the 
area in which they were present in the vicinity of forest operations by an officer 
authorised  under the  FMA.   As the  charges  later brought  against  them  confirm, 
the  police  officers  who  directed  them  to  leave,  and  arrested  and  removed  them 
when they did not, were purporting to exercise powers under the Protesters Act. 

 
A  person  authorised  under  the  FMA  may  direct  a  person  not  to  enter  or 
remain on land55.  That  person therefore exercises a power similar  to  that given 
by the Protesters Act to police officers.  But the direction given under the FMA is 
only  for  statutory  purposes  related  to  actual  operations  and  safety.    The 
authorised person can be expected to have this clearly in mind just as they would 
have  in  mind  the  object  of  s 13  of  the  FMA.    The  area  of  exclusion  would  be 
limited  to  no  more  than  is  necessary  for  the  operations  and  to  ensure  continued 
public access. 

The area to which the Protesters Act applies and in which a protester may 
 
not  be  present  will  in  many  cases  not  be  capable  of  identification,  but  the 
indications  given  by  that  Act,  in  particular  by  its  definitions,  are  that  it  is 
intended  to  apply  more  widely  than  land  which  may  be  the  subject  of  powers 
exercised under the FMA.  There is nothing in the Protesters Act to suggest that 
the  areas  to  which  it  is  intended  to  apply  are  coextensive  with those  designated 
under the FMA as unavailable for public access and use. 

 
It  follows  that  there  will  be  areas  of  forestry  land  which  will  not  be  the 
subject  of  the  exercise  of  the  powers  of  exclusion  under  the  FMA  but  to  which 
the Protesters Act will apply.  It may reasonably be inferred that persons would 
be able to access these areas in order to effectively voice their protests were it not 
for the Protesters Act.   

It can hardly be suggested that the provisions of the Protesters Act referred 
 
to above affect the freedom only slightly.  This is so even though protests about 
forest operations may be communicated in other ways.  Further, other methods of 
communication are less likely to be as effective as the communication of images 
of  protesters  pointing  to  what  they  claim  to  be  damage  to  the  natural 
environment.

It  has  been  explained56  that  the  exercise  of  powers  given  under  the 
 
Protesters Act will likely result in persons wrongly being excluded from areas of 
a  forest,  their  protests  being  brought  to  an  end,  and  them  being  deterred  from 
further protests in the foreseeable future.  In its practical operation the Protesters 
Act  indirectly  burdens  the  freedom  but  it  does  so  to  a  significant  extent.  
Generally speaking, the sufficiency of the justification required for such a burden 
should  be  thought  to  require  some  correspondence  with  the  extent  of  that 
burden57. 

A compelling justification? 

The plaintiffs submit that because the Protesters Act operates by reference 
 
to  political  and  environmental  protests,  it  is  directed  to  the  content  of  these 
political  communications  and  a  ""compelling  justification""  is  therefore  required.  
The submission implies that measures which burden the freedom in this way will 
require a higher level of justification. 

In ACTV, Mason CJ expressed58 the view that laws which ""target ideas or 
 
information"" may require ""a compelling justification"".  His Honour was speaking 
of  a  law  specifically  directed  at,  and  which  prohibited,  the  broadcasting  of 
matters  relating  to  public  affairs  and  political  discourse.    It  effected  a  direct 
burden on the freedom.  His Honour did not use the words ""content-based"" with 
respect  to  the  laws  in  question.    In  US  jurisprudence  concerning  the  First 
Amendment  that  term  may  refer  to  a  law  targeting  speech  based  on  its 
communicative  content59.    Under  the  doctrine  of  strict  scrutiny  such  a  law  is 
regarded as ""presumptively unconstitutional""60 because it poses ""the inherent risk 
that  the  Government  seeks  not  to  advance  a  legitimate  regulatory  goal,  but  to 
suppress unpopular ideas or information""61.

In  the  context  of  the  implied  freedom  and  the  test  in  Lange,  what 
 
Mason CJ said in ACTV might be thought to require more by way of justification 
only  at  the  balancing  stage  of  proportionality  analysis  rather  than  justification 
operating presumptively at the outset of the analysis under the second limb.  The 
only basis given in Lange for the invalidation of a law at the threshold, which is 
to say before testing for proportionality, is when a law does not have a legitimate 
purpose, in other words, where the purpose of the law is not compatible with the 
maintenance  of  the  scheme  of  representative  and  responsible  government  for 
which the Constitution provides62. 

 
It should in any event be observed that neither the terms of the Protesters 
Act  nor  its  purpose  seeks  to  affect  the  content  of  the  opinion  which  a  protester 
may seek to voice with respect to forest operations.  ""Protesters"" are defined by 
reference to those opinions, perhaps unnecessarily, but the Act takes it no further.  
Its terms, in their operation and effect, are directed to the conduct of protesters. 

McCloy and proportionality testing 

Although  the  purpose  of  the  Protesters  Act  meets  the  requirement  of 
 
compatibility, the  measures it adopts to  achieve that purpose effect a burden on 
the  freedom  and  must  be  further  justified63.    In  McCloy,  it  was  suggested64  that 
the  question  posed  in  Lange65  whether  a  measure  is  reasonably  appropriate  and 
adapted,  or  proportionate,  to  its  purpose  might  be  approached  by  reference  to 
certain criteria of proportionality.  If the criteria were not met, and the answer is 
in  the  negative,  it  would  follow  that  the  burden  imposed  on  the  freedom  is  not 
justified.  The means could not be said to meet the requirement of compatibility.  
The freedom would operate to restrict the exercise of legislative power. 

124 

Tasmania  submits  that  the  methods  of  analysis  suggested  in  McCloy  as 
 
useful to determine whether a provision is reasonably appropriate or adapted, or

In the course of argument it was pointed out that in  McCloy it was said66 
 
that  the  methods  of  proportionality  analysis  there  referred  to  might  not  be  the 
only  criteria  by  which  legislation  can  be  tested  in  accordance  with  Lange.  
Tasmania did not suggest any alternative method.  Queensland proposes that the 
question whether a statute could be said to be reasonably appropriate and adapted 
could be answered, for example, by simply determining if it went ""too far"".  Such 
an approach would invite little more from the Court than an impression.  It does 
not  address  the  need  for  transparency  in  reasoning  which  was  regarded  as 
necessary by a majority of Justices in McCloy67. 

The  Commonwealth  contends  for  a  ""modified  version  of  McCloy"".    In 
 
summary it accepts that the first enquiry, that of ""suitability"", which is as to the 
connection  of  a  measure  adopted  by  a  statute  to  its  purpose68,  is  relevant  to  all 
cases  involving  the  freedom.    The  second  test,  that  of  ""necessity""69,  should  be 
taken as sometimes, but not always, decisive.  The last assessment, that of strict 
proportionality or ""balancing""70, should only be undertaken where the burden on 
the freedom is ""direct and substantial"", it submits. 

The 

last-mentioned 

submission  overlooks 

that  Lange,  correctly 
 
understood, requires that any effective burden on the freedom  must be justified.  
The first enquiry posed by Lange is whether a burden, or restriction, is imposed 
on  the  freedom  at  all.    If  it  is,  the  process  of  justification  commences  with  the 
question of compatibility of purpose, as mentioned earlier in these reasons71, and 
it continues with enquiries as to proportionality. 

It  is  possible  that  a  slight  burden  on  the  freedom  might  require  a 
 
commensurate justification.  Certainly a heavy burden would ordinarily require a 
significant  justification.    Much  will  depend  upon  the  nature  of  the  legislative 
measure  and  its  effects.    No  general  rule  should  be  prescribed.    It  is  sufficient

here  to  observe  that  an  argument  that  only  particular  degrees  of  burden  warrant 
justification is inconsistent with Lange. 

34. 

 
The  Commonwealth  does  not  suggest  that  an  enquiry  as  to  whether  a 
legislative  measure  is  necessary  to  achieve  a  statute's  purpose  is  novel.    It  has 
been  utilised  for  some  time  with  respect  to  laws  which  burden  the  freedom 
guaranteed  by  s 92  of  the  Constitution  and,  more  recently,  with  respect  to  the 
freedom of political communication. 

 
There can be little doubt that the availability of other measures which are 
just as practicable to achieve a statute's purpose, but which are less restrictive of 
the  freedom,  may  be  decisive  of  invalidity72.    In  such  a  case  it  could  hardly  be 
said  that  the  measure  which  is  more  restrictive  of  the  freedom  is  necessary.    A 
legislative measure could not rationally be justified by an inexplicable legislative 
choice.    At  least  that  would  be  so  unless  some  other  means  of  justifying  the 
burden was identified. 

In  McCloy  the  Commonwealth  submitted73  that  some  statutory  purposes 
 
may  justify very  large  incursions on the freedom.  No such submission is  made 
by  Tasmania  in  this  case.    The  Commonwealth's  submissions  in  McCloy  drew 
attention  to  another  method  of  justification,  that  referred  to  as  the  test  of  strict 
proportionality.    The  point  presently  to  be  made  is  that  whilst  the  Court  may 
propose  methods of analysis, of what is proportionate or reasonably appropriate 
and adapted, it is for those supporting the impugned legislation to justify any of 
its measures which burden the freedom. 

Connection to purpose 

 
Given  that  the  purpose  of  the  Protesters  Act  is  to  prevent  damage  and 
disruption to forest operations from the conduct of protesters, the question arises 
whether the provisions referred to above can  be said to pursue that  purpose.  In 
McCloy74, the enquiry was said to be whether the statutory provisions in question 
have a rational connection to their purpose.  If they do not, it would follow that 
they are simply a burden on the freedom without a justifying purpose75.

This enquiry, as to the suitability of a legislative  measure76, is not novel.  
 
It  was  applied  in  Unions  NSW  v  New  South  Wales77  and  was  understood  in 
McCloy  to  be  ""an  inquiry  which  logic  requires""78. 
  The  view  of  the 
Commonwealth earlier mentioned, that the question will be relevant in all cases, 
is correct. 

 
The prohibitions in s 6 clearly enough reflect the purpose of the Protesters 
Act.  The fact that protesters are targeted is explained by the history of protests 
which  provided  a  catalyst  for  the  Act.    The  powers  of  direction,  removal  and 
arrest  and  the  offences  created  may  generally  be  seen  as  preventing  harms  to 
forest  operations  occurring  and  deterring  protesters  from  engaging  in  protest 
activities which may have those effects. 

 
Section 8(1)(b) cannot be said to share the purpose of the Protesters Act.  
It deters a person being in any business access area on pain of arrest or penalty, 
even  though  they  may  not  present  any  threat  of  damage  or  disruption  and  may 
not reasonably be considered to contravene s 6(1), (2) or (3).  The inference to be 
drawn  is  that  it  is  directed  solely  to  the  purpose  of  deterring  protesters.  
Accordingly, it fails the test of suitability.  

 
The  same  conclusion  may  be  reached  with  respect  to  s  11(7)  and  (8), 
which effect a blanket exclusion of a whole group of persons from an area by a 
single  direction  of  a  police  officer,  even  when  the  police  officer  could  not 
conceivably  have  formed  any  view  about  whether  each  person  is  about  to 
contravene  the  Protesters  Act.    So  understood,  the  only  purpose  of  these 
provisions  must  be  to  bring  a  protest  to  an  end  and  deter  further  protests, 
regardless of whether damage or disruption is foreseeable.   

 
The  period  over  which  s 11(6)  applies,  three  months  from  a  direction 
given  under  s 11(1)  or  (2),  might  suggest  that  it  is  intended  merely  to  further 
deter protesters.  However, it is not s 11(6) itself which effects that deterrence.  It 
creates  the  conditions  for  an  offence  under  s 6(4).    It  is  the  prospect  that  they 
might  offend  against  that  provision  which  will  deter  protesters  and  a  necessary 
element of that offence is a contravention of s 6(1), (2) or (3), which is connected 
to  the  statute's  protective  purpose.    The  period  of  three  months  referred  to  in 
s 11(6)  does  not  operate  outside  the  statutory  purpose.    Properly  understood,  it 
merely effects a limit on the temporal operation of s 6(4).

The  question  whether  s 11(6)  and  the  remaining  provisions  referred  to 
 
above  which  burden  the  freedom  (s  6(1),  (2)  and  (3),  s  11(1)  and  (2),  s  13  and 
Pt 4)  can  be  justified  falls  to  be  determined  by  whether  they  can  be  said  to  be 
necessary. 

Are the measures reasonably necessary? 

The question whether a law can be said to be reasonably necessary, in the 
 
sense in which that term applies in the context of the freedom, does not involve a 
free-ranging  enquiry  as  to  whether  the  legislature  should  have  made  different 
policy choices.  It involves determining whether there are alternative, reasonably 
practicable, means of achieving the same object but which have a less restrictive 
effect on the freedom79.  Where such alternative measures are obvious and their 
practicability compelling it may be difficult for those arguing for the validity of 
the  legislation  to  justify  the  legislative  choice  as  necessary,  as  previously 
explained80. 

 
The  FMA  does  not  burden  the  freedom  to  the  same  extent  as  does  the 
Protesters  Act.    It  seeks  to  ensure  that  only  those  persons,  protesters  included, 
whose presence or activities are likely to interfere with forest operations will be 
excluded  from  forestry  land.    The  Protesters  Act  operates  more  widely  than  its 
purpose requires.  It is principally directed to preventing protesters being present 
within  ill-defined  areas  in  the  vicinity  of  forest  operations  or  access  points  to 
those areas, whereas its purpose is similar to that of the FMA. 

The powers given by the FMA, in the context of PTPZ land, are directed 
 
to the protection of Forestry Tasmania's property, to its functions and operations 
and to the safety of its employees and the public.  The purpose of the Protesters 
Act  is  essentially  the  same.    So  far  as  concerns  forestry  land,  its  purpose  is  to 
prevent damage and disruption to forest operations. 

 
Tasmania  points  to  a  difference  between  the  Protesters  Act  and  other 
legislation which it submits is of importance.  That difference is that the focus of 
the Protesters Act is on protest activity.  So much may be accepted, but it serves 
only  to  identify  the  source  of  the  perceived  problem.    It  goes  no  way  towards 
explaining  why  measures  which  have  the  effect  of  deterring  protests  generally 
are reasonably necessary to its more limited purpose.  It is not all protest activity

which is the concern  of the Protesters Act,  but only  that kind which is likely to 
result in the aforementioned harms. 

37. 

 
The  Special  Case  contains  no  indication  that,  generally  speaking,  the 
provisions  of  the  FMA  have  been  ineffective  to  prevent  the  disruption  of  forest 
operations or damage to property associated with those operations.  Putting aside 
particular powers such as those given by s 11(6), (7) and (8), the basic powers of 
direction, removal and arrest provided by the Protesters Act are much the same as 
those  provided  by  the  FMA.    It  must,  however,  be  accepted  that  the  history  of 
environmental  protests  shows  that,  regardless  of  the  existence  of  these  powers, 
some protest activities having these effects have taken place.   

 
The  Protesters  Act  seeks  to  address  this  by  adopting  measures  which,  in 
their  operation  and  effect  in  the  context  of  that  statute,  will  have  substantial 
deterrent effects.  To an extent those effects are achieved by extending the areas 
of  its  operation,  creating  further  consequences  for  non-compliance  with 
directions including special offences and heavy penalties.  More importantly they 
are achieved by the uncertainty which surrounds the areas within which the Act 
applies. 

 
Tasmania  may  well  argue  that  the  Protesters  Act  may  be  distinguished 
from  the  FMA  because  of  its  strong  deterrent  effects.    Whether  it  will  be 
effective  with  respect  to  the  kinds  of  protests  to  which  its  purpose  is  addressed 
may be debatable.  It is not necessary to consider that question.  The concern of 
the  Court  is  the  extent  to  which  the  Protesters  Act  restricts  protests  more 
generally.  It is likely to deter protest of all kinds and that is too high a cost to the 
freedom given the limited purpose of the Protesters Act. 

 
The purpose of the Protesters Act is not significantly different from that of 
the FMA.  In the measures it adopts to deter protesters the Protesters Act goes far 
beyond  those  reasonably  necessary  for  its  purpose.    The  validity  of  the  FMA's 
measures  was  not  questioned  in  these  proceedings.    However,  it  is  sufficient  to 
observe  that  those  measures,  by  contrast,  are  substantially  less  restrictive  of  the 
freedom. 

US doctrines and Lange 

147 

 
These reasons do not invoke the void-for-vagueness doctrine which is part 
of US constitutional  jurisprudence81.  The plaintiffs make no claim to invalidity 
on the basis of such a doctrine.  Their claim for invalidity is that the provisions of

the  Protesters  Act  burden  the  freedom  and  cannot  be  justified  by  reference  to 
what was held in Lange and further explained in McCloy. 

38. 

 
The US doctrine is addressed to First Amendment freedom of speech and 
is  rooted  in  the  due  process  requirements  of  the  Fifth  and  Fourteenth 
Amendments,  neither  of  which  has  a  counterpart  in  the  Australian  Constitution 
and the implied freedom.  It is well understood that our Constitution does not say 
that the uncertainty of laws violates a constitutional safeguard82. 

Under  the  US  doctrine  of  vagueness,  vague  laws  are  per  se  invalid  and 
 
cannot  be  justified83.    Under  Australian  law  a  vague  law  is  not  invalid  on  that 
account  alone,  but  laws  which  have  that  quality  and  which,  in  their  practical 
operation  and  effect,  burden  the  freedom  must  be  justified  according  to  the 
questions  in  Lange  if  they  are  to  survive  challenge.    This  does  not  involve  the 
importation of foreign constitutional doctrine. 

Lange requires that a legislative measure which effects any burden on the 
 
freedom  be  assessed  not  only  for  its  purpose,  but  for  its  operation  and  effect84.  
The  ultimate  question,  whether  a  legislative  measure  can  be  justified  as 
reasonably  appropriate  and  adapted,  or  proportionate,  cannot  be  answered 
without determining its operation and effect.  The enquiry as to its effect on the 
freedom  generally  is  necessarily  one  about  its  operation  and  practical  effect85.  
Whilst  the  freedom  is  not  an  individual  right,  the  extent  of  the  burden  on  the 
freedom  is  usually  ascertained  by  reference  to  the  effect  upon  the  ability  of 
persons  to  communicate  on  the  matters  the  subject  of  the  freedom  in  various 
ways,  for  example  by  giving  political  donations  which  might  meet  the  costs  of 
political communication86 or, as here, by protesting.  It is not to the point that a 
court  might  resolve  the  bounds  of  the  physical  area  to  which  the  Protesters  Act 
applies in a given case, a question of mixed fact and law.  As earlier explained, at

39. 

 
Under  US  constitutional  law,  vague  laws  are  said  to  offend  several 
important values, one of which is the First Amendment freedom of speech87.  In 
the  context  of  First  Amendment  freedom  of  speech,  this  is  described  as  the 
""chilling  effect""88.    It  is  not  necessary  to  discuss  how  the  doctrine  is  applied  by 
US courts in determining the invalidity of a statute.  The term ""chilling effect"" is 
not employed in these reasons.  It has been used in judgments of this Court with 
respect to the implied freedom89; however, the term has relevantly been used only 
to  describe  an  effect  of  inhibition  or  deterrence  on  the  freedom  and  for  the 
purpose  of  determining  the  practical  effect  upon  political  communication  and 
debate. 

Conclusion and orders 

 
The  measures  adopted  by  the  Protesters  Act  to  deter  protesters  effect  a 
significant burden on the freedom of political communication.  That burden has 
not been justified.  The means adopted cannot be considered as compatible, in the 
sense described in Lange90. 

 
Part  4  provides  the  enforcement  regime  for  offences  under  the  Protesters 
Act.    To  the  extent  that  it  provides  for  enforcement  of  and  penalties  for  the 
provisions here held to be invalid, it too is invalid.

The Attorney-General of the Commonwealth submits without demur from 
any party or other intervener that the second and third of the questions stated at 
the beginning of the reasons for judgment of the plurality in McCloy v New South 
Wales91  should  be  reformulated  to  conform  to  the  second  step  in  the  analytical 
framework set out in Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation92 and refined 
in Coleman v Power93.  I agree.  For good measure, the first question there stated 
should  also  be  reformulated  to  conform  to  the  first  step  in  the  same  analytical 
framework.    

156 

The result is to restate the analytical framework for determining whether a 
 
Commonwealth,  State  or  Territory  law  contravenes  the  implied  freedom  of 
political  communication,  set  out  in  Lange  and  refined  in  Coleman,  in  terms  of 
three questions.  They are to the following effect:

Is  the  purpose  of  the  law  legitimate,  in  the  sense  that  it  is 
compatible with the maintenance of the constitutionally prescribed 
system of government? 

Is  the  law  reasonably  appropriate  and  adapted  to  advance  that 
purpose  in  a  manner  compatible  with  the  maintenance  of  the 
constitutionally prescribed system of government? 

If  the  first  question  is  answered  ""yes"",  and  if  either  the  second  question  or  the 
third question is answered ""no"", the law is invalid.   

157 

 
The Attorney-General of Queensland submits that the present opportunity 
should also be taken to put paid to the notion that the last of those questions must 
always  or  sometimes  be  answered 
three-staged 
""proportionality  testing"",  which  the  explanation  at  the  beginning  of  the  reasons 
for judgment of the plurality in McCloy went on to outline94.  Again, I agree.

Three-staged proportionality testing was not sought to be characterised in 
McCloy  as  anything  more  than  a  tool  of  analysis95,  not  to  be  confused  with  the 
constitutional principle it served96.  The plurality did not suggest that its adoption 
is compelled by the reasoning which supports the implication of the freedom of 
political  communication  as  authoritatively  expounded  in  Lange97.    The  plurality 
also disavowed any suggestion that  ""it is the  only criterion  by which legislation 
that restricts a freedom can be tested""98.   

The  point  is  therefore  not  one  of  reopening  and  overruling  McCloy:  
 
nobody  has  suggested  that  McCloy  was  wrongly  decided;  McCloy  does  not 
elevate three-staged proportionality testing to the level of constitutional principle; 
and  McCloy  does  not  endow  it  with  precedential  status.    The  point  is  one  of 
emphasising  that  the  tool  is,  at  best,  a  tool.    For  my  own  part,  I  have  never 
considered it to be a particularly useful tool. 

the  common 

law 

 
Though  it  originated  within  a  civil  law  tradition,  three-staged  testing  for 
proportionality (""Verhältnismäßigkeit"") has been found by some courts applying 
the  methodology  of 
to  be  useful  when  undertaking 
constitutionally  or  statutorily  mandated  rights  adjudication.    The  structure  it 
imposes is not tailored to the constitutional freedom of political communication, 
which  is  not  concerned  with  rights,  and  which  exists  solely  as  the  result  of  a 
structural implication concerned not with attempting to improve on outcomes of 
the  political  process  but  with  maintaining  the  integrity  of  the  system  which 
produces  those  outcomes.    The  first  stage  –  ""suitability""  (""Geeignetheit"")  –  can 
be  quite  perfunctory  if  confined  to  an  inquiry  into  ""rationality"".    The  second  – 
""necessity"" (""Erforderlichkeit"") – is too prescriptive, and can be quite mechanical 
if  confined  to  an  inquiry  into  ""less  restrictive  means"".    The  third  stage  – 
""adequacy  of  balance""  (""Zumutbarkeit"")  –  even  if  the  description  of  it  as 
involving  a  court  making  a  ""value  judgment""99  conveys  no  more  than  that  the 
judgment the court is required to make can turn on difficult questions of fact and

Tinkering  by 

 
introducing  refinements,  distinctions,  exceptions  or 
qualifications  into  each  of  the  three  stages  would  only  compound  a  more  basal 
problem.    Constitutional  adjudication  within  our  tradition  occurs  through  the 
elaboration  of  considerations  seen  in  the  light  of  history,  of  precedent  and  of 
contemporary  circumstances  to  bear  on  the  resolution  of  matters  in  issue.  
Constitutional analysis within that tradition cannot be reduced to the application 
of  some  pre-determined  all-encompassing  algorithm,  and  the  inappropriateness 
of  attempting  to  construct  such  an  algorithm  cannot  be  overcome  by  increasing 
its complexity.   

For  reasons  I  have  attempted  to  explain  in  the  past102,  the  entirety  of  the 
 
analytical  framework  set  out  in  Lange  and  refined  in  Coleman  needs  to  be 
understood as a reflection of the underlying reason for the implication of freedom 
of political communication.  The reason for the implication lies in the protection 
of  political  communication  on  which  depends  the  efficacy  of  electoral 
accountability  for  the  exercise  of  legislative  and  executive  power  within  the 
constitutionally  prescribed  national  system  of  representative  and  responsible 
government  to  which  there  is  added  a  mechanism  for  constitutional  change  in 
which  electors  through  referenda  participate  directly  in  the  legislative  process.  
The  first  question  is  directed  to  determining  whether  the  law  imposes  a 
meaningful  constraint  on  political  communication.    The  second  and  third 
questions,  as  now  restated,  are  directed  in  sequence  to  determining  whether  the 
particular  constraint  identified  in  answer  to  the  first  question  can  be  explained, 
and can be justified, as compatible with the maintenance of that constitutionally 
prescribed  system  of  government  which  the  constitutional  freedom  exists  to 
protect.   

163 

 
Expression  of  the  third  question  in  terms  no  more  prescriptive  than 
whether  the  law  is  reasonably  appropriate  and  adapted  to  advance  its  legitimate 
purpose  in  a  manner  compatible  with  the  maintenance  of  the  constitutionally 
prescribed system of government has the benefit of avoiding limiting or ordering 
in  advance  the  considerations  which  might  legitimately  bear  on  the  justification 
for a particular constraint on political communication.  The terms of the question 
do  not  deny  that,  as  with  all  constitutional  adjudication,  patterns  emerge  as

precedents accumulate.  What they do deny is that the analysis appropriate to be 
brought to bear on the determination of rights in controversy in a particular case 
can or should be constrained in the abstract. 

 
Expression  of  the  third  question in  those  terms  has  the  additional  benefit 
of allowing for acknowledgement of gradations in the measure of appropriateness 
and adaptedness.  Again for reasons I have attempted to explain in the past103, not 
every  law  which  effectively  burdens  freedom  of  political  communication  poses 
the same degree of risk to the efficacy of electoral accountability for the exercise 
of  legislative  and  executive  power.    For  that  reason  not  every  law  which 
effectively burdens freedom of political communication in pursuit of a legitimate 
purpose  demands  the  same  degree  of  justification,  and  concomitantly  not  every 
law  which  effectively  burdens  freedom  of  political  communication  needs  to  be 
subjected  to  the  same  intensity  of  judicial  scrutiny.    The  measure  of  the 
justification needs to be ""calibrated to the nature and intensity of the burden""104.  

The answer to the initial question of burden within the restated analytical 
 
framework  accordingly  informs  the  intensity  of  the  scrutiny  appropriate  to  be 
brought to bear in answering the ultimate question of justification.  Where a law 
effectively burdens freedom of political communication, and does so in pursuit of 
a legitimate purpose,  the degree of fit between  means (the  manner  in which the 
law  pursues  its  purpose)  and  ends  (the  purpose  it  pursues)  needed  to  conclude 
that  the  law  is  reasonably  appropriate  and  adapted  to  advance  its  purpose  in  a 
manner that is compatible with the maintenance of the constitutionally prescribed 
system  of  government  needs  to  be  calibrated  to  the  degree  of  risk  which  the 
burden imposed by the means chosen poses to the maintenance of representative 
and responsible government.   

166 

 
That  is  the  analytical  framework  to  which  I  propose  to  adhere  in 
examining  the  impugned  provisions  of  the  Workplaces  (Protection  from 
Protesters) Act 2014 (Tas) (""the Protesters Act"").

The  provisions  of  the Protesters  Act  the  validity  of  which  are  called  into 
question  by  the  circumstances  of  the  plaintiffs  disclosed  in  the  special  case  are 
quite limited.   

The  principal  provisions  impugned  are  ss  6,  8,  11  and  13(3),  in  their 
 
application  to  ""business  premises""  comprised  of  ""forestry  land""  that  is  Crown

land  declared  to  be  ""permanent  timber  production  zone  land""  under  the  Forest 
Management  Act  2013  (Tas)  (""the  Management  Act"")  and  that  is  managed  and 
controlled  by  Forestry  Tasmania,  and  in  their  application  to  ""business  access 
areas"" in relation to business premises comprised of such forestry land.  Forestry 
land relevantly comprises any area of permanent timber production zone land on 
which  ""forest  operations""  (being  work  comprised  of  or  connected  with, 
relevantly, harvesting trees or with land clearing in preparation for planting trees) 
are  being  carried  out105.    A  business  access  area  in  relation  to  such  an  area  of 
forestry land comprises so much of any area of land, including any road or public 
place,  outside  the  area  of  forestry  land  as  is  reasonably  necessary  to  enable 
ingress to and egress from the area of forestry land106.  The circumstances of the 
plaintiffs  disclosed  by  the  special  case  illustrate  that  the  imprecision  of  those 
definitions means that difficulty can occur in working out the metes and bounds 
of  the  geographical  areas  within  which  ss  6,  8,  11  and  13(3)  have  application.  
That difficulty does not play any part in my reasoning. 

Impugned  as  well  are  provisions  within  Pt  4,  which  in  their  relevant 
 
application  provide  for  the  prosecution  and  consequences  of  conviction  of 
offences  against  ss  6(4)  and  8(1).    Those  additional  provisions  are  of  adjectival 
significance and raise no separate issue. 

 
The plaintiffs seek also to challenge the validity of s 7.  The special case, 
however,  discloses  no  basis  for  inferring  that  the  plaintiffs  have  engaged  in 
conduct prohibited by that section or that they might seek to do so in the future.  
Notwithstanding that the defendant has chosen to concede standing, the absence 
of facts making it necessary to decide the validity of s 7 in order to determine the 
rights of the parties makes it inappropriate to address that question107. 

 
Pivotal to the operation of each of ss 6, 8, 11 and 13(3) is the definition of 
a  ""protester"".    By  virtue  of  that  definition,  a  person  answers  that  description  if, 
but only if, the person is engaging in ""a protest activity""108.  Apart from an added 
geographical requirement that the activity occur relevantly on forestry land or on 
a business access area in relation to forestry land, the defining characteristic of a 
protest  activity  is  that  it  is  an  activity  in  furtherance  of  or  for  the  purpose  of

promoting  awareness  or  support  for  ""an  opinion,  or  belief,  in  respect  of  a 
political,  environmental,  social,  cultural  or  economic  issue""109.    Rarely,  if  ever, 
would  an  activity  answering  that  statutory  description  not  amount  to  political 
communication within the protection of the implied freedom.  An activity which 
would  otherwise  answer  that  description  is  nonetheless  excluded  from  the 
statutory  definition  of  a  protest  activity  in  a  number  of  circumstances.    One  is 
where  it  is  protected  industrial  action  within  the  meaning  of  the  Fair  Work  Act 
2009  (Cth)  or  part  of  lawful  industrial  action  undertaken  by  a  State  Service 
officer  or  State  Service  employee110.    Another  relevantly  is  where  Forestry 
Tasmania has given its expressed or implied consent to the activity111.  

 
Important  also  to  the  operation  of  each  of  ss  6,  8,  11  and  13(3)  are  the 
definitions  of  ""business  activity""  and  ""business  occupier""112.    Business  activity 
encompasses any lawful activity carried out by Forestry Tasmania or carried out 
on  or  in  relation  to  forestry  land  by  another  entity  or  person  who  is  a  business 
occupier.    The  designation  of  business  occupier  is  applicable  to  Forestry 
Tasmania, its employees and its contractors. 

 
Central to the operation of the remainder of each of ss 6, 8, 11 and 13(3) 
are prohibitions to which s 6(1), (2) and (3) give expression.  Section 6(1) and (2) 
each  prohibit  a  protester  from  engaging  in  specified  conduct  which  ""prevents, 
hinders  or  obstructs""  the  carrying  out  of  a  business  activity  by  a  business 
occupier in circumstances where the protester knows, or ought reasonably to be 
expected  to  know,  that  the  conduct  is  likely  to  have  that  effect.    The  conduct 
specified  in  s  6(1)  is  entering  or  remaining  on  business  premises  or  a  part  of 
business  premises.    The  conduct  specified  in  s  6(2)  is  doing  an  act  on  business 
premises  or  on  a  business  access  area  in  relation  to  business  premises.  
Section 6(3)  prohibits  a  protester  from  doing  any  act  that  ""prevents,  hinders,  or 
obstructs""  access  to  an  entrance  to  or  an  exit  from business  premises  or  a 
business  access  area,  in  circumstances  where  the  protester  knows,  or  ought 
reasonably  to  be  expected  to  know,  that  the  act  is  likely  to  prevent,  hinder  or 
obstruct such access.     

172 

173 

174 

 
The  width  of  the  collocation  ""prevents,  hinders  or  obstructs""  within  each 
of s 6(1), (2) and (3) is given emphasis by s 6(7).  Section 6(7) makes clear that 
the collocation is not limited to but encompasses any act which prevents, hinders 
or  obstructs  the  use,  by  a  business  occupier  in  relation  to  business  premises,  of

any object on the business premises that belongs to, is in the possession of, or is 
to be used by, a business occupier in relation to the business premises, as well as 
any act which causes a risk to the safety of a business occupier in relation to the 
business  premises.    The  word  ""hinder""  in  such  a  context  cannot  be  confined  to 
physical  interference  and  must  rather  encompass  any  significant  adverse 
affecting of a usual way of doing that which is hindered113.     

 
Without  more,  a  protester  in  contravention  of  s  6(1),  (2)  or  (3)  has 
committed  no  offence.    To  see  how  a  contravention,  or  a  possible  past 
contravention  or  possible  future  contravention,  of  s  6(1),  (2)  or  (3)  can  have  a 
legal consequence, it is necessary to turn to ss 11 and 13(3). 

 
Section 11 confers three distinct discretions on a police officer.  The first, 
conferred  by  s  11(1),  empowers  a  police  officer  to  direct  a  person  who  is  on 
business premises to leave immediately ""if the police officer reasonably believes 
that  the  person  has  committed,  is  committing,  or  is  about  to  commit  ...  a 
contravention  of  section 6(1),  (2)  or  (3)"".    The  second,  conferred  by  s  11(2), 
empowers  a  police  officer  in  equivalent  circumstances  to  issue  an  equivalent 
direction  in  respect  of  a  person  who  is  in  a  business  access  area.    The  third, 
conferred  by  s  11(6),  empowers  a  police  officer  who  gives  a  direction  under 
s 11(1) or (2) to include in that direction a requirement that the person must not, 
in  the  period  of  three  months  after  the  date  on  which  the  direction  is  issued, 
commit an offence against the Protesters Act or contravene s 6(1), (2) or (3).  A 
direction  under  s  11(1)  or  (2)  can  be  issued  to  a  person  or  to  a  group114,  and  if 
issued to a group is to be taken to have been issued to each member of the group 
who ought reasonably to be expected to have heard the direction115. 

The  statutory  consequence  of  a  police  officer  giving  a  direction  under 
 
s 11(1)  or  (2)  is  to  trigger  the  operation  of  s  8.    Section  8(1)(a)  makes  it  an 
offence  for  a  person  to  remain  on  a  business  access  area  in  relation  to  business 
premises after having been directed by a police officer under s 11(2) to leave that 
business access area.  Section 8(1)(b) makes it an offence for a person to enter a 
business  access  area  in  relation  to  business  premises  within  four  days  after 
having  been  directed  by  a  police  officer  under  s 11(1)  to  leave those  business 
premises  or  under  s  11(2)  to  leave  a  business  access  area  in  relation  to  those

The additional statutory consequence of a police officer including within a 
direction  under  s  11(1)  or  (2)  a  requirement  under  s 11(6)  that  the  person  or 
group directed must not in the period of three months after the date on which the 
direction  is  issued  contravene  s  6(1),  (2)  or  (3),  is  to  trigger  the  operation  of 
s 6(4).  Section 6(4) makes it an offence for a person to contravene a requirement 
under s 11(6).  The offence is punishable, in the case of an individual, by a fine 
of up to $10,000117.  By operation of s 6(5), however, a person does not commit 
an offence against s 6(4) by reason only of taking part in a procession (or march, 
or  event)  that  passes  business  premises  or  along  a  business  access  area  ""at  a 
reasonable speed, once on any day"". 

 
Section  13(3)  empowers  a  police  officer  to  remove  from  business 
premises  or  from  a  business  access  area  a  person  ""who  the  police  officer 
reasonably believes is committing, or has committed"" a contravention of s 6(1), 
(2) or (3).  Section 13(4) qualifies that power by subjecting removal to the further 
condition that the police officer reasonably believes that it is necessary to do so 
for any of a number of specified purposes.  Those purposes include ""to preserve 
public order"", as well as ""to prevent the continuation or repetition of an offence"" 
relevantly against s 6(4) or s 8(1), and ""for the safety or welfare of members of 
the public or of the person"".  The police officer is entitled to use reasonable force 
to effect removal118. 

The burden

Whether,  and  if  so  how  and  how  intensely,  a  law  effectively  burdens 
 
freedom  of  political  communication  is  a  qualitative  question  to  be  answered  by 
reference to the legal operation and practical effect of the law119.  The expression 
""effectively burden[s]"" has been recognised to mean ""nothing more complicated

than that the effect of the law is to prohibit, or put some limitation on, the making 
or the content of political communications""120.   

49. 

 
The effect of a law on the making or content of political communications 
is  in  turn  gauged  by  nothing  more  complicated  than  comparing:    the  practical 
ability of a person or persons to engage in political communication with the law; 
and the practical ability of that same person or those same persons to engage in 
political  communication  without  the  law.    In  Australian  Capital  Television  Pty 
Ltd  v  The  Commonwealth121,  for  example,  the  relevant  burden  on  political 
communication  resulting  from  prohibitions  on  broadcasting  political  advertising 
imposed on licensed broadcasters  was found  in the practical effect of excluding 
persons who would otherwise have done so from using radio and television as a 
medium of political communication during election periods. 

Since  Levy  v  Victoria122  was  decided  contemporaneously  with  Lange, 
 
there  can  have  been  no  doubt  that  political  communications  include  non-verbal 
political  communications  and  that  non-verbal  political  communications  include 
assembly and movement for the purpose of political protest123.  A law which has 
the  direct  and  substantial  effect  of  prohibiting  or  limiting  assembly  and 
movement  for  the  purpose  of  political  protest  is  accordingly  a  law  which 
effectively burdens freedom of political communication. 

The  laws  found  in  Levy  effectively  to  burden  freedom  of  political 
 
communication  were  regulations  which  prohibited  persons  who  did  not  hold 
valid game licences from entering an area of Crown land designated as a hunting 
area  within  a  period  designated  as  an  open  season  for  hunting,  and  from 
approaching within a distance of less than five metres any holder of a valid game 
licence who was actually hunting in that area during that period.  The finding that 
the  laws  effectively  burdened  freedom  of  political  communication  was 
unanimous.    McHugh  J  alone  added  a  qualification.    Noting  that  the  implied 
freedom of political communication does not create rights but merely invalidates 
laws, and that the implied freedom therefore ""gave the protesters no right to enter 
the  hunting  area"",  his  Honour  suggested  that  unless  the  protesters  had  a  legal

right  to  enter  the  hunting  area  ""it  was  the  lack  of  that  right,  and  not  the 
[r]egulations, that destroyed their opportunity to make their political protest""124. 

50. 

 
Notwithstanding  a  concession  on  the  part  of  the  defendant  that  the 
impugned provisions of the Protesters Act effectively burden freedom of political 
communication, the qualification McHugh J expressed in Levy looms large in the 
argument of the defendant and interveners in the present case.  The qualification 
expressed by his Honour therefore requires careful consideration.   

His  Honour's  notation  that  the  implied  freedom  does  not  create  an 
 
affirmative right to engage in political communication is uncontroversial.  It was 
confirmed  in  McClure  v  Australian Electoral  Commission125.    It  has  often  since 
been repeated126. 

 
His Honour's addition of the suggestion that the implied freedom may not 
have been burdened in the absence of the protesters having a legal right to enter 
the  hunting  areas  needs  to  be  treated  with  caution.    Understood  against  the 
background of the observation in Lange that ""[u]nder a legal system based on the 
common law, 'everybody is free to do anything, subject only to the provisions of 
the law'""127, the point of general significance his Honour can be seen to have been 
making  was  that  an  impugned  law  cannot  have  the  effect  of  constraining  the 
ability of persons to engage in a form of political communication if those persons 
would  be  prohibited  by  some  other  valid  law  from  engaging  in  that  form  of 
political communication in any event.  That must ordinarily be so, and that is as 
far as his Honour's suggestion can be taken.  His Honour's suggestion would not 
accurately  reflect  the  nature  of  the  implied  freedom  were  it  treated  as  a 
suggestion  that  political  communications  protected  by  the  implied  freedom  are 
limited  to  those  in  which  persons  have  some  pre-existing  legally  enforceable 
right to engage.

Mulholland  v  Australian  Electoral  Commission128  cannot  be  read  as 
 
having taken his Honour's suggestion to that extreme.  The different conclusions

expressed in Mulholland as to whether freedom of political communication was 
burdened  need  to  be  understood  in  the  context  of  the  argument  there  advanced.  
The  argument  was  that  statutory  restrictions  on  registration  of  a  political  party, 
imposed  by  the  ""500  rule""  and  the  ""no  overlap  rule"",  had  the  practical  effect  of 
precluding that form of communication with voters about the party affiliation of 
a  candidate  which  occurs  as  a  result  of  the  performance  by  the  Australian 
Electoral  Commission  of  its  statutory  function  of  causing  the  name  of  a 
registered political party to be printed on a ballot paper.  Gleeson CJ and Kirby J, 
who concluded that  there was a burden on freedom of political communication, 
compared  the  communication  which  would  occur  in  that  form  without  the  500 
rule  and  the  no  overlap  rule  and  the  absence  of  communication  which  would 
occur in that form with those restrictions129.  McHugh J, Gummow and Hayne JJ 
and  Callinan  J,  who,  like  Heydon  J,  concluded  that  there  was  no  burden  on 
freedom of political communication, compared the communication which would 
occur  in  that  form  with  and  without  the  entirety  of  the  statutory  regime  for  the 
registration of political parties of which the 500 rule and the no overlap rule were 
treated as forming inseverable parts130.    

The  considerations  identified  in  Lange  which  support  the  implication  of 
 
freedom  of  political  communication  cannot  justify  confining  its  protection  to 
political  communications  in  which  persons  seeking  to  communicate  have  a 
legally enforceable right to engage.  Political communication, on which electoral 
accountability  for  the  exercise  of  legislative  and  executive  power  within  our 
constitutionally prescribed system of representative and responsible government 
has  always  depended,  has  never  in  practice  been  so  confined.    Political 
communication  has  rather  in  practice  occurred  through  a  range  of  media  which 
have  varied  through  time  and  space  according  to  their  practical  availability  and 
technological  feasibility.    Political  communication  has  also  occurred  within  a 
system  of  laws  which  have  imposed  any  number  of  constraints  on  the  making 
and content of communications.  Some of those constraints have been imposed as 
a  means  of  rationing  limited  public  resources  which  have  from  time  to  time 
provided platforms for political communication, ranging from physical spaces131 
to  the  electromagnetic  spectrum132.    Others  have  been  imposed  to  protect

compatible  yet  competing  public  interests,  including  but  not  limited  to  the 
protection  of  property,  of  safety,  of  reputation,  of  amenity  and  of  privacy.  
Accepting  that  some  other  laws  (including,  as  the  outcome  in  Lange  illustrates, 
some  legal  rules  of  long  standing)  might  themselves  need  to  be  adjusted  to 
accommodate to the implied freedom133, the impact of any given law on political 
communication  (and  in  turn  on  electoral  accountability  for  the  exercise  of 
legislative and executive power) lies in the incremental effect of that law on the 
real-world  ability  of  a  person  or  persons  to  make  or  to  receive  communications 
which  are  capable  of  bearing  on  electoral  choice.    Therein  lies  its  relevant 
burden. 

189 

 
Nothing  therefore  turns  on  whether  or  not  a  protester  has  a  legally 
enforceable  right  to  enter  or  remain  on  Crown  land  declared  to  be  permanent 
timber  production  zone  land. 
  There  are,  as  the  special  case  reveals, 
approximately  800,000  hectares  of  permanent  timber  production  zone  land  in 
Tasmania.    Historically,  members  of  the  public  have  in  fact  enjoyed  access  to 
that land.  Continuation of that public access is facilitated by the general statutory 
obligation  of  Forestry  Tasmania  under  the  Management  Act  to  ""perform  its 
functions  and  exercise  its  powers  so  as  to  allow  access  to  permanent  timber 
production  zone  land  for  such  purposes  as  are  not  incompatible  with  the 
management""  of  that  land  under  that  Act134.    Without  concern  for  Hohfeldian 
classification,  the  second  reading  speech  for  the  Bill  for  the  Management  Act 
adopted the language of everyday life in describing ""the people of Tasmania"" as 
having a ""right to access the land"" which would ""continue so long as the access 
does not interfere with the management of the land""135. 

190 

 
Nor  does  anything  turn  on  the  detail  of  the  statutory  functions  of 
managing  permanent  timber  production  zone  land  and  of  undertaking  forest 
operations  on  permanent  timber  production  zone  land  which  the  Management 
Act confers on Forestry Tasmania or on the details of the statutory powers which 
the Management Act confers in support of those functions.  Forestry Tasmania is 
specifically empowered ""for the purposes of discharging its responsibilities or in 
the interests of safety"" to erect a sign on permanent timber production zone land

or  on  or  in  respect  of  a  forest  road136,  or  to  erect  a  sign  or  barricade  closing  a

direction on a sign that has been erected or by driving or being  on a forest road 
that  has  been  closed  commits  an  offence  punishable  by  a  fine  of  up  to  $3,180.  
Irrespective of whether such a sign or barricade has been created, an authorised 
employee  of  Forestry  Tasmania  who  forms  an  opinion  that  any  person's  entry, 
presence  or  action  ""has  prevented  or  is  about  to  prevent  [Forestry  Tasmania] 
from  effectively  or  efficiently  performing  its  functions""  can  request  the  person 
not to enter or to leave, or to stop some activity on, permanent timber production 
zone  land  or  a  forest  road,  with  the  consequence  that  a  person  who  fails  to 
comply with the employee's request commits an offence also punishable by a fine 
of up to $3,180138.  In addition, a police officer can give directions to persons on 
permanent  timber  production  zone  land  or  a  forest  road,  with  the  consequence 
that a person who fails to comply with the police officer's direction commits an 
offence also punishable by a similar fine139.  No party or intervener submits that 
the impugned provisions depend for their relevant operation on the prior exercise 
of any one or more of those statutory powers under the Management Act.  Each 
of  those  statutory  powers  is  in  any  event  itself  limited  by  the  implied  freedom 
with  the  consequence  that  an  issue  of  validity  would  arise  were  any  of  them 
exercised purportedly to impede political communication140. 

191 

 
More  significant  to  an  assessment  of  the  relevant  burden  imposed  by  the 
impugned  provisions  is  the  long  history  of  political  protest  on  Crown  land  in 
Australia.    Most  significant  is  the  history  of  on-site  political  protests  on  Crown 
land in Tasmania, directed to bringing about legislative or regulatory change on 
environmental issues, beginning with the protest activity between 1981 and 1983 
which  preceded  enactment  of  the  World  Heritage  Properties  Conservation  Act 
1983  (Cth).    The  special  case  reveals  that,  since  2006,  37  protests  have  taken 
place  in  Tasmania  in  areas  that  have  subsequently  been  granted  legislative  or 
regulatory  environmental  protection.    The  communicative  power  of  on-site 
protests,  the  special  case  emphasises  and  common  experience  confirms,  lies  in 
the  generation  of  images  capable  of  attracting  the  attention  of  the public  and  of 
politicians  to  the  particular  area  of  the  environment  which  is  claimed  to  be 
threatened and sought to be protected.

intensity  of 

the  burden 

The  nature  and 

 
 
imposed  on  political 
communication by the impugned provisions of the Protesters Act fall therefore to 
be considered against a background of historical and continuing public access to 
permanent  timber  production  zone  land,  of  limited  statutory  regulation  of  that 
public  access,  and  of  historical  and  likely  continuing  on-site  political  protests 
directed  to  bringing  about  legislative  or  regulatory  change  on  environmental 
issues on Crown land in Tasmania.  

 
The  nature  of  the  burden  imposed  on  political  communication  by  the 
impugned provisions is that the burden can be expected to fall in practice almost 
exclusively  on  on-site  political  protests  of  that  description.    Not  only  are  the 
provisions targeted by the definition of protester to political communication, but 
they are targeted by the same definition to political communication occurring at 
particular geographical locations.  Given those geographical locations, and given 
the history of on-site protests in Tasmania, it would be fanciful to think that the 
impugned  provisions  are  not  likely  to  impact  on  the  chosen  method  of  political 
communication of those whose advocacy is directed to bringing about legislative 
or regulatory change on environmental issues and would have little or no impact 
on political communication by those whose advocacy is directed to other political 
ends.   

 
The  intensity  of  the  burden  which  the  impugned  provisions  impose  on 
political  communication  by  protesters  –  their  real-world  impact  on  the  making 
and receipt of communications capable of bearing on electoral choice – cannot be 
gauged by treating s 6(1), (2) and (3) as if they were self-executing prohibitions 
and by treating ss 6(4), 8(1), 11 and 13(3) as if they were merely ancillary to the 
enforcement of s 6(1), (2) and (3).  That is not the legislative design. 

 
The  extent  of  the  practical  constraint  on  the  making  and  receipt  of 
communications capable of bearing on electoral choice is rather to be seen in the 
ambit of the discretions conferred on police officers by ss 11 and 13(3) and in the 
consequences which flow from the exercise of those discretions.     

 
Once exercised to direct a group to leave a business access area in relation 
to forestry land, for example, the discretion conferred by s 11(2) results in each 
person  within  the  group  committing  an  offence  against  s  8(1)(a)  if  that  person 
does  not  leave  immediately.    And  once  exercised  to  direct  a  group  to  leave 
forestry land or a business access area in relation to forestry land, the discretions 
conferred  by  s  11(1)  and  (2)  each  have  the  result  that  each  person  within  the 
group will commit an offence against s 8(1)(b) if that person enters the same area 
of forestry land or any business access area in relation to that forestry land at any 
time during the next four days.  Upon the exercise of police discretion to give a 
direction  under  s  11(1)  or  (2),  the  particular  protest  in  which  the  group  was 
engaged must for most practical purposes be at an end.  The immediacy and the 
continuity are lost.

An  exercise  of  discretion  under  s  11(6)  will  have  the  added  result  of 
inhibiting  the  group  from  renewing  that  protest  or  from  engaging  in  any  other 
protest for the next three months.  It will do so by exposing each member of the 
group  to  the  jeopardy  of  potentially  committing  the  considerably  more  serious 
offence created by s 6(4) if the members choose to protest on any forestry land or 
any  business  access  area  in  relation  to  any  forestry  land  by  engaging  in  any 
protest  activity  other  than  marching  as  a  group  outside  forestry  land  or  along  a 
business access area in relation to forestry land at reasonable speed once a day.   

There is an overlap, although not a precise overlap, between forestry land 
 
or  a  business  access  area  in  relation  to  forestry  land  on  which  only  a  protester 
might incur a fine of up to $10,000 by failing to comply with a direction given by 
a police officer under s 11(1) or (2) and on which only a protester might incur a 
fine of up to $10,000 by contravening a requirement that has in the previous three 
months been included in such a direction under s 11(6), on the one hand, and an 
area  of  permanent  timber  production  zone  land  or  a  forest  road  on  which  any 
person might incur a fine of up to $3,180 under the Management Act by failing 
to  obey  a  direction  on  a  sign  erected  by  Forestry  Tasmania  or  by  failing  to 
comply  with  a  direction  by  a  police  officer  or  with  a  request  made  by  an 
authorised employee of Forestry Tasmania, on the other hand.  The overlap does 
not  diminish  the  discriminatory  operation  of  the  Protesters  Act,  but  rather 
accentuates that discriminatory operation.  Protesters, as protesters, are alone put 
twice in jeopardy, and are put in the greater jeopardy. 

 
The  burden  on  political  communication  imposed  by  the  impugned 
provisions  is,  as  the  plaintiffs  correctly  submit,  direct,  substantial  and 
discriminatory  –  facially  against  political  communication  and  in  its  practical 
operation  more  particularly  against  political  communication  expressive  of  a 
particular political view.  

The calibration 

In  Australian  Capital  Television,  Deane  and  Toohey  JJ  presciently 
 
observed  that  ""a  law  whose  character  is  that  of  a  law  with  respect  to  the 
prohibition  or  restriction  of  [political]  communications  …  will  be  much  more 
difficult to justify … than will a law whose character is that of a law with respect 
to  some  other  subject  and  whose  effect  on  such  communications  is  unrelated  to 
their nature as political communications""141.   

201 

 
Noting that their Honours' observation had been accepted and applied in a 
number of subsequent  cases, before and after  Lange, I sought to expand on that 
observation in Tajjour v New South Wales when I referred to the level of scrutiny

appropriate  to be  brought to bear  on a  law which imposes  a  burden  on political 
communication  as  lying  within  a  spectrum.    Using  language  drawn  from  the 
analyses of Gaudron J in Levy142 and of Gleeson CJ in Mulholland143, I said144: 

""At  one  end  of  the  spectrum,  establishment  of  a  sufficient  justification 
may  require  'close  scrutiny,  congruent  with  a  search  for  ""compelling 
justification""',  constituted  by  establishing  that  the  law  pursues  an  end 
identified in terms of the protection of a public interest which is itself so 
pressing and substantial as properly to be labelled compelling and that the 
law  does  so  by  means  which  restrict  communication  on  governmental  or 
political  matter  no  more  than  is  reasonably  necessary  to  achieve  that 
protection.  At the other end of the spectrum, establishment of a sufficient 
justification may require nothing more than demonstration that the means 
adopted  by  the  law  are  rationally  related  to  the  pursuit  of  the  end  of  the 
law, which has already been identified as legitimate."" 

Because  it  is  a  factor  which  bears  on  the  degree  of  risk  that  political 
 
communications unhelpful or inconvenient or uninteresting to a current majority 
might  be  unduly  impeded,  the  extent  to  which  the  legal  operation  or  practical 
effect  of  a  law  might  be  capable  of  being  seen  to  be  discriminatory  –  against 
communications,  against  political  communications,  or  against  political 
communications 
bears 
correspondingly on where within that spectrum the level of scrutiny appropriate 
to  be  brought  to  bear  on  that  law  is  located.    Of  course,  the  measure  is  not 
scientific.    It  can  itself  be  nothing  more  than  a  heuristic  tool.    But  it  is  a  tool 
custom-made  to  place  the  question  of  the  justification  for  the  particular  burden 
which the law imposes on political communication on a scale which reflects the 
reason why the question is asked.

Given  that  they  operate  in  their  terms  to  target  action  engaged  in  for  the 
purpose  of  political  communication,  and  given  that  they  can  be  expected  to 
operate  in  practice  to  impose  a  significant  practical  burden  on  political 
communication  which  is  the  expression  of  a  particular  political  viewpoint,  the 
impugned provisions demand very close scrutiny.   

 
To  be  justified  as  reasonably  appropriate  and  adapted  to  advance  a 
legitimate  purpose  in  a  manner  that  is  compatible  with  the  maintenance  of  the 
constitutionally prescribed system of government, in my opinion, the purpose of 
the  impugned  provisions  must  be  able  to  be  seen  to  be  compelling  and  the

provisions  must  be  able  to  be  seen  to  be  closely  tailored  to  the  achievement  of 
that purpose in the sense that the burden they impose on political communication 
in  pursuit  of  the  purpose  can  be  seen  to  be  no  greater  than  is  reasonably 
necessary to achieve it. 

 
That level of scrutiny,  it must be noted, is somewhat  more stringent than 
was warranted by the circumstances in Levy, where the regulation in question did 
not discriminate facially against persons engaged in political communication but 
was  rather  in  the  form  of  a  blanket  prohibition  on  all  persons  other  than  those 
holding  valid  game  licences  entering  designated  areas  of  Crown  land  within  a 
designated period.  Even so, it ought also to be noted, the regulation in question 
in  Levy  would  undoubtedly  have  withstood  the  intense  level  of  scrutiny  I 
consider  to  be  warranted  here.    The  statutorily  identified  purpose  of  the 
regulation  –  to  ""ensure  a  greater  degree  of  safety  of  persons  in  hunting  areas 
during  the  open  season  for  duck""  –  was  unanimously  accepted  to  be  the  true 
purpose  of  the  regulation,  and  was  undoubtedly  compelling.    The  manner  in 
which the regulation sought to advance that purpose, having regard to the manner 
of its identification of the characteristics of persons caught by its prohibition and 
having  regard  to  the  precision  of  its  geographical  and  temporal  operation,  was 
closely  tailored  to  achievement  of  that  purpose.    There  was,  to  use  language 
drawn from the statement of conclusion by Toohey and Gummow JJ, ""no greater 
curtailment of the constitutional freedom than was reasonably necessary to serve 
the public interest in the personal safety of citizens""145. 

 
The requisite analysis therefore appropriately proceeds to an examination 
of whether the impugned provisions  might be explained as having a compelling 
purpose,  and  then  to  an  examination  of  whether  the  burden  they  impose  on 
political  communication  in  pursuit  of  such  a  purpose  might  be  justified  as  no 
greater than is reasonably necessary to achieve such a purpose. 

The possible explanation 

 
For  a  purpose  to  be  legitimate,  it  must  be  seen  to  be  a  purpose  that  is 
compatible  with  the  maintenance  of  the  constitutionally  prescribed  system  of 
government.    For  a  legitimate  purpose  to  be  compelling,  it  must  be  seen  to  be 
protective of a public interest of sufficient importance reasonably to warrant that 
label. 

Determination  of  the  purpose  of  a  law  has  sometimes  been  said  to  be  a 
 
question of construction.  That description is not inaccurate insofar as it conveys 
that the purpose of a law cannot be equated with the subjective purpose of a law-
maker  and  is  instead  a  question  to  be  answered  objectively  by  reference  to  the

text  and  context  of  the  law.    The  description  would  be  inaccurate  were  it  to  be 
taken  to  suggest  that  the  question  is  confined  to  attributing  meaning  to  the 
statutory  text.    The  correct  understanding  is  that  ""[t]he  level  of  characterisation 
required  by  the  constitutional  criterion  of  object  or  purpose  is  closer  to  that 
employed  when  seeking  to  identify  the  mischief  to  redress  of  which  a  law  is 
directed""146. 

 
The  purpose  of  a  law  is  the  ""public  interest  sought  to  be  protected  and 
enhanced"" by the law147.   The purpose is not what the law does in  its terms but 
what  the  law  is  designed  to  achieve  in  fact148.    The  purpose  can  sometimes  be 
found  spelt  out  in  the  text  of  the  law.    More  often  than  not,  the  purpose  will 
emerge from an examination of its context.   

 
The  defendant  argues  that  the  purpose  of  the  impugned  provisions  is  to 
""ensure  that  protesters  do  not  prevent[,]  impede,  hinder  or  obstruct  the  carrying 
out of [lawful] business activities on business premises or business access areas"".  
That composite description of purpose is problematic.  To constrain the conduct 
of  protesters  as  protesters  is  to  limit  freedom  of  political  communication.    To 
limit  freedom  of  political  communication  is  simply  not  a  purpose  that  is 
compatible  with  the  maintenance  of  the  constitutionally  prescribed  system  of 
government.  To constrain the conduct of protesters as protesters may be a means 
to a legitimate end, but it cannot be a legitimate end in itself. 

 
Seizing  on  that  weakness,  the  plaintiffs  argue  that  the  purpose  of  the 
impugned provisions should be identified as nothing more than the prevention of 
on-site  protests  –  a  purpose  plainly  antithetical  to  the  maintenance  of 
representative and responsible government. 

 
Coming  to  the  defendant's  rescue,  the  Attorney-General  for  Victoria 
argues  that  the  overall  purpose  of  the  impugned  provisions  –  what  they  are 
designed to achieve in fact – is ""to protect businesses in Tasmania from conduct 
that  seriously  interferes  with  the  carrying  out  of  business  activity,  or  access  to 
business premises on which that business activity is conducted"".  In their relevant 
application,  the  purpose  of  the  provisions  is  on  that  view  to  protect  Forestry 
Tasmania  from  conduct  that  seriously  interferes  with  carrying  out  forest 
operations on forestry land and from conduct that seriously interferes with access 
to forestry land on which those forest operations are being carried out.

There  could  be  no  question  that  such  a  purpose  is  compatible  with  the 
maintenance of the constitutionally prescribed system of government.  Although 
they would dispute that a purpose of protecting Forestry Tasmania from a minor 
or  transient  interference  would  be  enough,  the  plaintiffs  do  not  argue  that  the 
purpose identified by the Attorney-General for Victoria would not be sufficiently 
protective of an important public interest to justify the impugned provisions were 
they reasonably appropriate and adapted to advance that purpose compatibly with 
the maintenance of the constitutionally prescribed system of government. 

The  plaintiffs'  rejoinder  is  that  the  singling  out  of  protest  activity  shows 
 
that  the  impugned  provisions  are  so  ill-adapted  to  the  protection  of  Forestry 
Tasmania's  forest  operations  that  protection  of  Forestry  Tasmania's  forest 
operations cannot be concluded to have been their true purpose149. 

 
Where determination of the purpose of a law is controversial, resolution of 
that controversy can be assisted by considering how closely the legal operation of 
the law conforms to an asserted purpose.  In an extreme case, the disconformity 
might be so great as to admit of the conclusion that the law cannot be explained 
as having the asserted purpose.   

Where an asserted purpose is plausible, however, examination of how well 
 
the  legal  operation  of  the  law  conforms  to  that  purpose  can  sometimes  more 
profitably  be  left  to  be  examined  at  the  stage  of  asking  whether  the  law  is 
reasonably  appropriate  and  adapted  to  advance  that  purpose  in  a  manner  that  is 
compatible  with  the  maintenance  of  the  constitutionally  prescribed  system  of 
government.    If  the  answer  is  that  the  law  is  not  reasonably  appropriate  and 
adapted  to  advance  the  asserted  purpose,  the  controversy  as  to  whether  the  law 
can be explained as having the asserted purpose or is better explained as having 
some other purpose will have become redundant150. 

 
The  explanation  of  the  purpose  of  the  impugned  provisions  advanced  by 
the Attorney-General for Victoria being plausible, I do not think it incumbent to 
reach a conclusion as to whether the purpose  of the impugned provisions  might 
better  be  characterised  (as  the  plaintiffs  would  have  it)  as  the  prevention  of  on-
site  protests.    Analysis  of  the  compatibility  of  the  impugned  provisions'  burden 
on  freedom  of  political  communication  with 
the 
constitutionally prescribed system of government can proceed to the final step in 
the Lange analysis on  the assumption that the purpose of the provisions in their

relevant application is  to protect Forestry  Tasmania from  conduct  that  seriously 
interferes  with  carrying  out  forest  operations  on  forestry  land  or  with  access  to 
forestry land on which those forest operations are being carried out. 

The attempted justification 

 
The determinative question, then, is whether the impugned provisions can 
be  justified  as  compatible  with  maintenance  of  the  constitutionally  prescribed 
system of representative and responsible government on the basis that the burden 
they impose on freedom to engage in political communication constituted by on-
site  political  protests  is  no  greater  than  is  reasonably  necessary  to  achieve  the 
postulated legislative purpose of protecting Forestry Tasmania from conduct that 
seriously  interferes  with  carrying  out  forest  operations  on  forestry  land  or  that 
seriously interferes with access to forestry land on which those forest operations 
are being carried out.   

 
The  question  might  be  addressed  in  different  ways.    For  my  own  part,  I 
think it useful to isolate and consider first those respects in which the impugned 
provisions might be seen to be framed in terms that are narrower than reasonably 
necessary  to  achieve  the  postulated  purpose  by  failing  to  prevent  conduct  that 
might  seriously  interfere  with  carrying  out  forest  operations  on  forestry  land  or 
that might seriously interfere with access to forestry land.  I think it then useful to 
go  on  to  consider  some  significant  respects  in  which  the  impugned  provisions 
might  be  seen  to  be  framed  in  terms  that  are  broader  and  more  burdensome  on 
freedom of political communication than is reasonably necessary to achieve that 
purpose, in that they have the effect of penalising on-site protest activity which is 
plainly  harmless  or  which,  although  it  might  reasonably  be  thought  to  interfere 
with the carrying out of forest operations or  with access to forestry land, would 
not in fact do so. 

 
The  narrowness  –  underinclusiveness  –  inherent  in  the  definition  of 
protester  is  stark.    Particularly  is  that  so  when  the  targeted  nature  of  the 
prohibitions  in  ss  6(1),  (2),  (3),  (4)  and  8(1)(a)  and  (b)  is  contrasted  with  the 
comprehensive  coverage  of  the  prohibition  in  Levy  and  with  the  comprehensive 
coverage of prohibitions that can be put in place under the  Management Act by 
Forestry  Tasmania  erecting  a  sign  or  closing  a  forest  road  for  the  purposes  of 
discharging its responsibilities or in the interests of safety.   

Two  groups  of  persons  walk  along  a  forest  road,  which  has  not  been 
 
closed by Forestry Tasmania but which provides access to an area of land within 
permanent  timber  production  zone  land  on  which  Forestry  Tasmania  is 
harvesting timber.  One is a group of protesters.  The other is a group of school 
children on an excursion, or of recreational walkers on an organised hike.  Or it 
might  be  a  group  of  local  residents  rallying  in  support  of  the  forest  operations 
with  the  support  of  Forestry  Tasmania.    Or  perhaps  it  is  even  a  group  of 
disgruntled employees of Forestry Tasmania engaged in lawful industrial action.

Each group has the same non-trivial adverse effect on the movement of logging 
vehicles  entering  and  exiting  the  area:    the  vehicles  need  to  proceed  with  much 
more  caution;  they  need  to  slow  and  they  may  even  need  to  detour  or  to  stop.  
The  one  group  is  subject  to  the  strictures  imposed  by  the  impugned  provisions.  
The other is not. 

 
Underinclusiveness  need  not  be  fatal  to  the  validity  of  a  law  which 
burdens  political  communication.    The  upholding  in  McCloy  of  the  prohibition 
on political donations by property developers illustrates that the implied freedom 
does  not  operate  to  produce  the  result  that  a  legislature  addressing  a  mischief 
needs always to find a solution to the whole of that mischief.  Underinclusiveness 
which results in a legislative burden falling unevenly on political communication 
is  nevertheless  a  factor  which  weighs  against  the  conclusion  that  a  law  is 
reasonably necessary to achieve its postulated purpose, for the same reason that 
discrimination against political communication warrants heightened scrutiny.   

Where  underinclusiveness  is  especially  problematic  is  where  it  occurs  in 
 
combination with other factors which tend to indicate that the targeting of one of 
a  number  of  sources  of  a  postulated  problem  results  in  a  burden  on  political 
communication by a targeted segment of the population which is more extensive 
or more severe than might be expected had a more comprehensive solution been 
sought.  That was not the situation in McCloy.  It is the situation here. 

 
The  main  overreaching  of  the  impugned  provisions  is  in  the  breadth  and 
severity of the consequences which flow not from contravention by a protester of 
a prohibition in s 6(1), (2) or (3), but from the exercise of the police discretions 
under  ss  11(1),  (2)  and  (6)  and  13(3),  each  of  which  turns  simply  on  a  police 
officer  having  a  reasonable  belief  that  a  protester  or  a  group  of  protesters  is  in 
contravention of a prohibition in s 6(1), (2) or (3).  

 
Whether the group of protesters remains on the forest road or moves onto 
the area on which harvesting is being carried out, each protester within the group 
is liable without warning to be removed under s 13(3).  The trigger for removal is 
not  contravention  of  a  prohibition  in  s  6(1),  (2)  or  (3),  but  a  police  officer 
reasonably  believing  that  the  protester  to  be  removed  has  committed  or  is 
committing  such  a  contravention  and  reasonably  believing,  sufficiently,  that 
removal  is  necessary  to  preserve  the  public  order.    The  police  officer's  belief, 
although reasonable, might be wrong.  The removal is still lawful. 

 
If  the  group  of  protesters  remains  on  the  forest  road,  the  group  can  be 
given a direction under s 11(2), not if any one or more of them has contravened a 
prohibition  in  s  6(1),  (2)  or  (3),  but  if  a  police  officer  reasonably  believes  that 
they  have  committed,  are  committing,  or  are  about  to  commit  such  a 
contravention.    If  they  do  not  immediately  move  off  the  road,  each  protester 
within the group is liable for an offence against s 8(1)(a), not because he or she 
has  contravened  a  prohibition  in  s  6(1),  (2)  or  (3),  but  because  he  or  she  has

failed  to  comply  with  the  direction.    Again,  the  police  officer's  belief,  although 
reasonable, might be wrong.  The offence is still committed.  

62. 

 
If the group of protesters has moved from the forest road onto the area on 
which  harvesting  is  being  carried  out,  the  group  can  be  given  a  direction  under 
s 11(1),  again  not  if  any  one  or  more  of  them  has  contravened  a  prohibition  in 
s 6(1),  (2)  or  (3),  but  if  a  police  officer  reasonably  believes  that  they  have 
committed,  are  committing,  or  are  about  to  commit  such  a  contravention.    Yet 
again, the police officer's belief, although reasonable, might be wrong.  

 
The criminal consequences which then follow automatically under  s 8(1) 
from an exercise of discretion under s 11(1) or (2) travel well beyond protecting 
the operations of Forestry Tasmania which the police officer reasonably believed 
had  been,  were  being,  or  were  about  to  be  prevented,  hindered  or  obstructed  at 
the  time  of  exercising  the  discretion.    So  much  is  that  so,  that  visiting  those 
consequences could not even be described as using a blunt instrument to achieve 
that  purpose.    The  lack  of  fit  has  a  temporal  dimension  and  a  geographical 
dimension.  Irrespective of whether the protesters would or might prevent, hinder 
or obstruct harvesting operations or access to the area on which forest operations 
are being carried out,  none of them  can return to that area or to any  forest  road 
providing access to that area for an arbitrary period of four days.  Each protester 
would commit an offence merely by his or her presence.  

 
The  choice  of  a  police  officer,  when  giving  a  direction  under  s  11(1)  or 
(2),  to  add  a  requirement  under  s  11(6)  is  again  a  matter  of  discretion.  
Inexplicably,  in  spite  of  the  severe  criminal  consequences  which  flow  under 
s 6(4) from the adding of such a requirement, the police officer is not required to 
form any additional belief before exercising that additional discretion.  

 
The criminal consequences which flow under s 6(4) from the adding of a 
requirement  under  s  11(6)  travel  so  far  beyond  protecting  the  operations  of 
Forestry Tasmania which the police officer when giving a direction under s 11(1) 
or (2) reasonably believed had been, were being, or were about to be prevented, 
hindered  or  obstructed,  as  to  lack  even  the  most  tenuous  connection.    They  are 
nothing  short  of  capricious  in  their  temporal  duration  of  three  months  and 
nothing short of punitive in their geographical coverage and intensity.  

 
During the wholly arbitrary period of three months, any protest activity in 
which the group or any of its members engages on or near any permanent timber 
production  zone  land  which  turns  out  to  be  in  contravention  of  a  prohibition  in 
s 6(1), (2) or (3), and which in the absence of a requirement under s 11(6) being 
added  to  a  direction  under  s  11(1)  or  (2)  would  have  attracted  no  criminal 
sanction, becomes criminal activity attracting a severe penalty.  By virtue only of 
the  requirement  having  been  imposed  under  s  11(6),  each  protester  within  the 
group  who  finds  himself  or  herself  in  contravention  of  s  6(1),  (2)  or  (3)  within 
that  three  month  period  can  be  arrested  and  prosecuted  for  an  offence  against

s 6(4) without any warning needing to be given, in circumstances where anyone 
else  engaging  in  exactly  the  same  activity  would  escape  criminal  liability 
entirely.  With Pythonesque absurdity, however, the group is permitted by s 6(5) 
to  march  along  a  forest  road  once  a  day,  provided  they  do  so  at  a  reasonable 
speed and irrespective of whether or not in doing so they would prevent, hinder 
or obstruct access to the area on which forest operations are being carried out.  

 
The  burden  the  impugned  provisions  impose  on  freedom  to  engage  in 
political communication constituted by on-site political protests is greater than is 
reasonably  necessary  to  protect  Forestry  Tasmania  from  conduct  that  seriously 
interferes  with  carrying  out  forest  operations  on  forestry  land  or  with  access  to 
forestry land on which those forest operations are being carried out. 

The result 

It follows that, assuming the second question in the Lange framework can 

 
be answered ""yes"", the third question must be answered ""no"". 

 
Sections  6,  8,  11  and  13(3),  in  their  application  to  business  premises 
comprised of forestry land which is Crown land declared to be permanent timber 
production  zone  land  under  the  Management  Act  and  in  their  application  to 
business access areas comprised of land which is reasonably necessary to enable 
ingress  to  and  egress  from  such  forestry  land,  together  with  those  provisions  of 
Pt 4  which  provide  for  the  prosecution  and  consequences  of  conviction  of 
offences against ss 6(4) and 8(1) in that application, are invalid.  That conclusion 
should not be understood to involve any conclusion about the severability of the 
impugned provisions, in their relevant operation, from the remainder of the Act.  
No issue of severability has been raised.

The parties have chosen to state three questions in  the special  case.   The 
first  question  no  longer  arises  because  the  defendant  has  conceded  that  the 
plaintiffs  have  standing.    As  to  the  remaining  questions,  I  am  content  to  join  in 
the formal answers proposed by Kiefel CJ, Bell and Keane JJ.

236  NETTLE  J.      I  have  had  the  advantage  of  reading  in  draft  the  reasons  for 
judgment of Kiefel CJ, Bell and Keane JJ and, with respect, I substantially agree 
with their Honours' conclusions.  I also gratefully adopt their Honours' summary 
of the way in which the Workplaces (Protection from Protesters) Act 2014 (Tas) 
(""the Protesters Act"") came to be applied to the plaintiffs in this case.  Inasmuch, 
however, as I am not persuaded that the Protesters Act is shown to be lacking in 
its  necessity,  but  I  consider  that,  in  some  respects,  it  is  not  adequate  in  its 
balance, in the sense in which those expressions are used in McCloy v New South 
Wales151,  it  is  appropriate  that  I  state  my  own  reasons  for  concluding  that  the 
Protesters  Act  is  not  reasonably  appropriate  and  adapted  to  advancing  a 
legitimate  legislative  end  and  therefore  impermissibly  burdens  the  implied 
freedom of political communication152.   

The burden on the implied freedom 

237 

 
A  law  is  taken  to  impose  an  effective  burden  on  the  implied  freedom  of 
political  communication  if  it  at  all  prohibits  or  limits  political  communication, 
unless  perhaps  the  prohibition  or  limitation  is  so  slight  as  to  have  no  real 
effect153.  Whether the terms, operation or effect of the Protesters Act so burden 
the  implied  freedom  is  to  be  assessed  by  reference  to  the  freedom  of  political 
communication  generally  as  opposed  to  any  notion  of  an  individual's  right  to 
communicate154.    Questions  of  the  extent  of  the  burden  assume  principal 
significance in relation to the assessment, to be undertaken later in these reasons, 
of  whether  the  law  is  appropriate  and  adapted  to  its  purpose155.    As  Gageler  J

observed  in  McCloy156,  however,  the  first  stage  of  analysis  is  not  perfunctory:  
the  careful  identification  of  the  burden  upon  the  implied  freedom  is  the 
foundation for any posterior analysis of its justification.  Acknowledging that the 
test  of  an  effective  burden  at  this  first  stage  of  the  analysis  is  qualitative,  not 
quantitative157,  it  is  necessary  in  what  follows  to  describe  the  terms,  operation 
and effect, both legal and practical, of the Protesters Act.  

(i) The relevance to federal and State politics of environmental issues relating to 
Tasmania's forests  

 
The  facts  stated  in  the  Special  Case  make  clear  that  Tasmania's 
environmental  issues  are  of  significant  relevance  to  both  federal  and  State 
politics and to the choice afforded to the people by the Constitution in respect of 
federal  elections158.    There  has  been  a  Commonwealth  Minister  for  the 
Environment  since  1971.    The  Minister  is  responsible,  inter  alia,  for  the 
administration  of  the  Environment  Protection  and  Biodiversity  Conservation 
Act 1999 (Cth).  The Commonwealth and each of the State governments are also 
signatories  to  the  National  Forest  Policy  Statement,  the  foreword  to  which 
records:   

""The Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments attach the utmost 
importance  to  sustainable  management  of  Australia's forests.    In  order  to 
achieve the full range of benefits that forests can provide now and in the 
future, the Governments have come together to develop a strategy for the 
ecologically sustainable management of these forests.  The strategy and its 
policy  initiatives  will  lay  the  foundation  for  forest  management  in 
Australia into the next century.""   

 
In previous federal election campaigns, public debate about environmental 
issues in Tasmania has featured prominently.  In 1983, the future of the Franklin 
River and protests against its damming were major federal election issues.  In the 
last  fortnight  of  the  campaign  in  2004,  the  Opposition  Leader  and  the  Prime 
Minister  flew  to  Tasmania  to  announce  their  parties' respective  policies  relating 
to  forests  and  logging.    In  2007,  one  of  the  two  issues  which  dominated  the 
federal election campaign in Tasmania was the proposed Gunns pulp mill for the 
Tamar Valley, for which the feedstock was in part to be sourced from Tasmania's 
native  forests.    In  2011,  the  Prime  Minister  and  the  Tasmanian  Premier  signed 
the  Tasmanian  Forests  Intergovernmental  Agreement  2011,  which  gave  interim

protection  from  logging  to  places  adjacent  to  the  Tasmanian  Wilderness  World 
Heritage Area to enable an independent verification process to be undertaken to 
assess the area's value and available timber resources.  In 2013, the extension to 
the  Tasmanian  Wilderness  World  Heritage  Area  was  a  federal  election  issue.  
Consequently,  it  is  apparent  that  Tasmania's  forests  are  a  significant  matter  of 
government and politics in Australia.  

(ii) The history of protests against forest operations in Tasmania  

As  is  also  apparent  from  the  Special  Case,  there  is  a  long  history  of 
 
environmental protests in Australia, especially in Tasmania, aimed at influencing 
public and governmental attitudes towards logging and the protection of forests.  
In  the  experience  of  the  first  plaintiff,  on-site  protests  against  forest  operations 
and  the  broadcasting  of  images  of  parts  of  the  forest  environment  at  risk  of 
destruction are the primary means of bringing such issues to the attention of the 
public and parliamentarians.   Media coverage, including social  media coverage, 
of on-site protests enables images of the threatened environment to be broadcast 
and  disseminated  widely,  and  the  public  is  more  likely  to  take  an  interest  in  an 
environmental  issue  when  it  can  see  the  environment  sought  to  be  protected.  
On-site  protests  have  thus  contributed  to  governments  in  Tasmania  and 
throughout  Australia  granting  legislative  or  regulatory  environmental  protection 
to  areas  not  previously  protected.    Since  2006,  37  protests  have  taken  place  in 
Tasmania  in  areas  that  have  subsequently  been  granted  legislative  or  regulatory 
environmental protection.  Most of those areas were included in an extension, by 
some 170,000 hectares, to the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area which 
was approved by  the World Heritage Committee in June 2013.  The Tasmanian 
Wilderness World Heritage Area comprises approximately 1.6 million hectares.   

(iii) Freedom to protest against forest operations in Tasmania 

 
Forestry  Tasmania  has  undertaken  forest  operations  in  the  Lapoinya 
Forest,  which  is  the  area  the  subject  of  the  Special  Case,  since  mid-2014.  
Forestry  Tasmania,  a  Tasmanian  Government  Business  Enterprise,  was 
established  as  the  Forestry  corporation  under  the  now  repealed  Forestry 
Act 1920 (Tas)  and  continues  in  existence  under  s 6  of  the  Forest  Management 
Act 2013 (Tas)  (""the  FMA"").    Perforce  of  s 7  of  the  FMA,  the  Forestry 
corporation is the Forest Manager for ""permanent timber production zone land"".  
Permanent  timber  production  zone  land  is  defined  in  s 3  of  the  FMA  as  Crown 
land declared to be permanent timber production zone land under s 10; any land 
purchased by the Forestry corporation under s 12; and certain State forest land as 
listed  in  Sched 2.    A  ""forest  road""  is  defined  as  any  road  constructed  or 
maintained  by  or  for  the  Forest  Manager  either  inside  or  outside  permanent 
timber production zone land and any other road on permanent timber production

zone land other than a State highway, subsidiary road or local highway159.  Under 
s 8  of  the  FMA,  the  Forest  Manager  has  the  functions  of  managing  and 
controlling all permanent timber production zone land and of undertaking forest 
operations  on  permanent  timber  production  zone  land  for  the  purpose  of  selling 
forest  products.    Perforce  of  s 9,  the  Forest  Manager  has  such  powers  as  are 
necessary  to  enable  it  to  perform  its  functions,  including  power  to  grant  to  a 
person a permit, licence, lease or other occupation right in relation to permanent 
timber  production  zone  land.    There  are  approximately  800,000  hectares  of 
permanent timber production zone land in Tasmania.   

 
Section  13  of  the  FMA  requires  the  Forest  Manager  to  perform  its 
functions  and  exercise  its  powers  so  as  to  allow  access  to  permanent  timber 
production  zone  land  for  such  purposes  as  are  not  incompatible  with  the 
management of the land.  Consistently  with that provision, and as appears from 
the second reading speech relating to the Forest Management Bill 2013 (Tas)160, 
it has for a long time been accepted that members of the public are free to enter 
upon  and  enjoy  permanent  timber  production  zone  land,  including  by  way  of 
conducting  protests  on  such  land  in  a  manner  that  is  not  incompatible  with  the 
Forest Manager performing its functions. 

The  freedom  so  to  access  and  protest  on  permanent  timber  production 
 
zone  land  is,  however,  not  unqualified.    Axiomatically,  it  is  subject  to  general 
law proscriptions of unlawful conduct and to the specific provisions of the FMA.  
Under s 21 of the FMA, the Forest Manager may erect signs on or in respect of 
forest  roads  or  permanent  timber  production  zone  land  for  the  purposes  of 
discharging its responsibilities or in the interests of safety, and, in the event that 
such  signs  are  erected,  a  person  must  not  without  lawful  excuse  undertake  an 
activity or engage in conduct on the forest road or permanent timber production 
zone land contrary to the directions expressed on the signs.  Failure to comply is 
an offence punishable by a fine not exceeding 20 penalty units161.  Under s 22 of 
the FMA, a person appointed by the Forest Manager as an authorised officer may 
request  that:    a  person  not  enter  permanent  timber  production  zone  land  or  a 
forest  road;  a  person  leave  permanent  timber  production  zone  land  or  a  forest 
road; or a person cease to undertake an activity or engage in conduct on the land 
or road if, in each case, the authorised officer is of the opinion that the entry or 
presence  of  that  person,  or  his  or  her  activity  or  conduct,  is  preventing,  has

prevented  or  is  about  to  prevent  the  Forest  Manager  from  effectively  or 
efficiently performing  its functions.  Failure to comply is an offence punishable 
by a fine not exceeding 20 penalty units162.  Under s 23 of the FMA, the Forest 
Manager may, by sign or barricade, or both, close a forest road or any section of 
forest road either permanently or temporarily to all traffic, or to a class of traffic, 
if the Forest Manager considers that the closure is necessary or expedient for the 
purposes of discharging its responsibilities or in the interests of safety.  A person 
who  passes  over  a  forest  road  that  has  been  so  closed  is  guilty  of  an  offence 
punishable  by  a  fine  not  exceeding  20  penalty  units163.    It  is  not  suggested  that 
any  applicable  general  law  proscription  of  unlawful  conduct  or  any  restriction 
imposed by the FMA is invalid. 

(iv) Unlawful protests against forest operations in Tasmania 

 
As further appears from the Special Case, there is a substantial history of 
unlawful  protests  against  forest  operations  in  Tasmania.    Between  1981  and 
1983,  there  was  considerable  protest  activity  concerning  the  proposal  by  the 
Tasmanian  government  and  the  Hydro-Electric  Commission  to  construct  a  dam 
on  the  Gordon  River  below  its  junction  with  the  Franklin  River.    That  protest 
action  included  a  blockade  of  an  area  of  the  Franklin  River  near  the  dam  site 
which  was  intended  to  obstruct  development  works  for  the  dam.    The  proposal 
became an election issue at the federal election called for 5 March 1983.  Protests 
on Hydro-Electric Commission land continued with 77 protesters evicted from a

KIEFEL CJ, BELL, GAGELER, NETTLE AND GORDON JJ.   On 17 August 
20171,  at  the  conclusion  of  the  hearing,  the  Court  made  orders  allowing  the 
appeal and setting aside the order of the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of 
Queensland  dated  11  November  2016.    The  appellant's  conviction  was  quashed 
and a new trial was ordered.  These are the reasons for making those orders.  

 
The  question  raised  by  the  appeal  is  whether  an  unwilled,  criminally 
negligent act can found a conviction for murder under s 302(1)(a) of the Criminal 
Code  (Q)  (""the  Code"")  in  a  case  in  which  the  jury  is  satisfied  that  the  accused 
possessed  the  intention  to  kill  or  to  do  some  grievous  bodily  harm.    As  will 
appear, the answer is that  criminal  responsibility  for  murder  under  the  Code,  as 
under  the  common  law,  cannot  be  founded  upon  an  unwilled  act.    As  will  also 
appear,  and  contrary  to  the  way  the  matter  was  left  below,  identification  of  the 
act  that  gives  rise  to  criminal  responsibility  for  murder  under  the  Code  is  not 
determined on a more confined basis than under the common law.   

Procedural history and the evidence  

 
On 28 October 2015, the appellant was arraigned in the Supreme Court of 
Queensland (Dalton J) on an indictment that charged him with the murder of his 
de  facto  partner,  Natalie  Leaney,  at  Rochedale  South  on  10  March  2013.    The 
appellant pleaded that he was not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter.  It 
was  common  ground  that  the  death  of  the  deceased  was  occasioned  by  a  single 
gunshot  wound  to  the  head  fired  from  a  shotgun,  which  the  appellant  was 
holding.    The  appellant's  plea  acknowledged  that  his  failure  to  use  reasonable 
care and to take reasonable precautions in his use or management of the gun was 
a gross breach of the duty imposed by s 289 of the Code2.  That section provides:  

""It is the duty of every person who has in the person's charge or under the 
person's control anything … of such a nature that, in the absence of care or 
precaution  in  its  use  or  management,  the  life,  safety,  or  health,  of  any 
person  may  be  endangered,  to  use  reasonable  care  and  take  reasonable 
precautions  to  avoid  such  danger,  and  the  person  is  held  to  have  caused

any  consequences  which  result  to  the  life  or  health  of  any  person  by

The prosecution declined to accept the appellant's plea in discharge of the 
indictment and a jury was empanelled and the trial proceeded.  On 4 November 
2015 the jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder.  On 19 November 2015, the 
appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment for this offence.  

 
The evidence at the trial was of a deterioration in the relationship between 
the appellant and the deceased in the days leading up to her death.  The deceased 
had told a friend that the relationship was over and that the appellant had told her 
to pack her things.  She said she wanted to leave but she was concerned that the 
appellant would take her property.  For his part, the appellant had complained to 
an acquaintance that he had ""found out about [the deceased] screwing around"".   

 
On Saturday 9 March, the deceased told a work colleague that she and the 
appellant  had  had  a  ""huge  fight""  on  the  previous  day.    The  next  day  she  sent  a 
message to the same colleague saying that she would not be at work on Monday.  
On that day the deceased also sent a text message to a friend complaining that the 
appellant  had  locked  her  in  their  unit.    The  friend,  the  friend's  partner  and  the 
appellant  were  together  at  a  hotel  when  the  message  was  received.    Following 
this,  the  appellant  and  the  deceased  exchanged  mutually  abusive  and  angry  text 
messages  in  which  the  deceased  asserted  that  the  lease  of  the  unit  was  in  her 
name and that she had paid the bond.   

 
The  appellant  returned  to  the  unit,  where  he  was  heard  arguing  with  the 
deceased.    An  associate,  Shea  Fenton,  arrived,  and  on  entering  the  unit  saw  a 
broken vase on the floor.  Fenton heard the appellant say that he would rather ""go 
back  to  jail  or  something,  I'll  shoot  you"".    He  saw  the  appellant  pick  up  a 
sawn-off shotgun and cartridges from some shelving, open the barrel and load the 
gun.    The  appellant  and  the  deceased  continued  arguing  and  Fenton  heard  the 
appellant  say,  ""I  don't  give  a  fuck,  I'll  kill  you  …  I'll  go  back  to  jail"".    The 
appellant walked towards the deceased and out of Fenton's sight.  Fenton heard a 
gunshot.  He jumped up, entered the loungeroom and saw that the deceased had 
been shot.   

 
In  the  immediate  aftermath  of  the  discharge  of  the  weapon  the  appellant 
showed  evident  signs  of  distress.    He  rang  the  Triple  0  emergency  number  but 
was too distraught to complete the call.  He was still hysterical when the police 
arrived.  He told the police that he did not know who had shot the deceased but 
that it was ""over drugs"".  He said that he had accidentally locked the deceased in 
the unit when he went out.  He denied that they had been fighting.  He gave an

elaborate,  false,  account  of  two  men  who  had  come  to  the  unit  to  rob  him  of 
drugs  and  money.    He  said  that  one  was  armed  with  a  shotgun  which  had 
discharged  when  he,  the  appellant,  endeavoured  to  take  hold  of  it.    The  police 
found  a  knife  on  the  floor  near  a  discharged  cartridge.    They  found  two  other 
discharged  cartridges  on  the  other  side  of  the  neighbouring  fence.    It  was  the 
prosecution case that the appellant had placed the knife on the floor and thrown 
the  two  shotgun  cartridges  over  the  fence  to  bolster  his  false  account  of  the 
robbery.

Expert  evidence  established  that  the  spur  of  the  hammer  of  the  gun  had 
been  shortened.    This  alteration  reduced  the  grip  on  the  hammer  and  made  it 
more difficult to control when cocking the gun.  The gun failed the ""hammer slip 
test"":    it  was  prone  to  discharge  when  the  hammer  was  released  before  being 
fully  cocked.    To  fully  cock  the  gun  it  was  necessary  to  pull  the  hammer  back 
16.8 millimetres.    The  modifications  to  this  gun,  however,  meant  that  it  would 
discharge  when  the  hammer  was  drawn  back  as  little  as  10 millimetres.    The 
rebound  safety,  which  prevents  the  hammer  from  falling  unless  the  trigger  is 
simultaneously depressed, was also compromised.  The gun could be deliberately 
fired  when  cocked  by  pulling  the  trigger  or  it  could  be  deliberately  fired  by 
releasing  the  hammer  when  it  was  pulled  back  by  at  least  10  millimetres.    The 
shortened hammer spur presented the risk that the shooter's finger might slip off 
it when cocking the gun, thereby releasing the hammer.  

10 

The  firing  pin  impression  on  the  discharged,  fatal  cartridge  established 
 
that the cartridge had been fired from the gun when the gun was in the fully, or 
almost  fully,  cocked  position.    The  gun  was  between  15 centimetres  and 
1.25 metres from the deceased, most likely between 45 and 75 centimetres, at the 
time of discharge.

The appellant did not give or call evidence.   

The way the prosecution case was put at trial 

12 

 
The prosecution's principal case at trial was that the appellant discharged 
the gun deliberately in a fit of rage intending to kill the deceased.  The evidence 
of the capacity of the gun to discharge when not fully cocked as the result of the 
shooter's finger slipping off the hammer spur led the prosecution to particularise 
a novel, alternative case:  in the event the jury was not satisfied that the discharge 
of the gun was occasioned by the appellant's willed act, but was satisfied that the 
deceased's death was caused by the appellant's failure to use reasonable care and

to take reasonable precautions in  his use  or  management of the gun3, and at the 
time he intended to kill or to do some grievous bodily harm to the deceased, his 
guilt of murder would be proved.   

 
Defence counsel objected to the prosecution's alternative case, submitting 
that it was not open to ""prove the causation by means of a negligent or reckless 
act and, at the same time, couple that with an intention to cause a specific result"".   

 
The  trial  judge  considered  that  there  was  a  real  possibility  that  the  jury 
might find that the appellant intended to kill the deceased and, to this end, he had 
loaded and presented the gun at her, and commenced cocking it, but that because 
of  the  peculiarities  of  this  gun  it  may  have  discharged  without  him  deliberately 
pulling  the  trigger  or  releasing  the  hammer.    Consistently  with  the  way  the 
prosecution  case  had  been  particularised,  her Honour  concluded  that  under  the 
Code the act for which an accused bears criminal responsibility in a prosecution 
for  murder  based  on  the  discharge  of  a  firearm  is  limited  to  the  pulling  of  the 
trigger or another act that deliberately  causes the weapon to discharge.  Despite 
her  initial  reluctance  to  accept  the  analysis  of  the  alternative  case,  her Honour 
concluded  that  ""it  is  legitimate  for  the  Crown  ...  to  use  section  289  as  a 
component  of  its  murder  case  essentially  to  plug  the  gap  left  by  a  reasonable 
doubt  about  a  willed  act"".    Her  Honour  was  fortified  in  this  conclusion  by  the 
1904 decision of the Full Court in R v Macdonald and Macdonald4.

The  jury  was  instructed  that  the  expression  ""willed  act""  was  a  ""pretty 
specific concept"" and her Honour instanced the muscular action of squeezing the 
trigger.  With respect to Question 1, the jury was directed that it was incumbent 
on the prosecution to exclude beyond reasonable doubt that the gun discharged as 
the result of the appellant's finger slipping on the shortened spur and releasing the 
hammer.

terms: 

""[I]f  you  ended  up  looking  at  this  third  question  in  column  2,  you  have 
done it because you had a reasonable doubt about the willed act.  You are 
satisfied  that  the  gun  was  dangerous.    You  are  satisfied  there  was  not 
proper  care  taken.    You  are  satisfied  that  caused  death.    And  then  the 
Crown  case  is,  well,  if  at  the  time  the  gun  discharged  there  was  an 
intention  to  kill  or  do  grievous  bodily  harm,  that  still  results  in  a  murder 
conviction.    …    [T]he  third  question  in  the  second  column's  almost  the 
same as the intention  question in the first column.  So I am certainly not 
going  to  go  through  all  that  evidence  again,  but  it  is  the  same  question 
really except that the question in the second column, the time you have to 
be satisfied – and this is very important – is the time the gun discharged.  
Okay.    So  that  is  the  time  you  are  looking  at  to  find  an  intention.    So  it 
might  just  be  split  seconds  after,  but  it  is  after  the  cocking  of  the  gun.""  
(emphasis added) 

The Court of Appeal 

18 

19 

 
The  appellant  appealed  against  his  conviction  to  the  Court  of  Appeal  of 
the  Supreme  Court  of  Queensland  (Gotterson JA  and  Atkinson J;  McMurdo P 
dissenting), contending that it was an error to invite the jury to consider finding 
him guilty of murder in the event it was not satisfied that the gun was discharged 
by his willed act. 

 
The majority approached the determination of the appeal upon a view that 
the Code does not expressly confine liability for an unlawful killing caused by a 
breach of the s 289 duty to manslaughter rather than murder5.  In their Honours' 
view, the fact that a contravention of s 289 does not depend on the existence of 
murderous  intent  does  not  mean  that  where  that  intent  is  present  the 
contravention  may  not  be  classified  as  murder6.    Their Honours  saw  no 
incongruity in conduct falling below a standard of objective reasonableness being 
coupled  with  a  specific  intent7.    In  this  respect,  their  Honours  considered

objective  reasonableness  to  be  quite  distinct  from  the  intention  with  which  acts 
constituting a breach of duty are carried out8.  They concluded9: 

7. 

 
""Where  a  person  who  holds  a  murderous  intent  towards  another 
picks up a gun to shoot the other person and, as a result of a failure on the 
person's part to take reasonable care and precaution, the gun discharges, it 
would be incongruous that, because the gun discharged earlier and not in 
precisely  the  way  the  person  intended,  the  person  who  kills  is  guilty  of 
manslaughter  and  not  murder.    Such  an  outcome  would  be  almost 
paradoxical  and  would  fail  sufficiently  to  take  into  account  the  fact  that 
the person unlawfully killed, intending to kill."" 

20 

21 

 
McMurdo P, in dissent, observed that it was for the jury to determine what 
willed  act  or  acts  were  done  or  not  done  by  the  appellant  and,  if  done,  whether 
those  acts  caused  the  death10.    Her Honour  questioned  the  capacity  of  a 
criminally negligent act to result in a conviction for an intentional offence11.  In 
her Honour's  view  a  breach  of  the  objective  standard  applicable  to  the  duty 
imposed  by  s 289  can  support  only  a  conviction  for  manslaughter  under  s 303, 
and not murder under s 302(1)(a)12.   

Murder under the Code 

 
It is axiomatic that criminal responsibility is founded on the offender's acts 
or omissions13.  And it is axiomatic in an offence of specific intent that the act or 
omission  and  the  intent  must  coincide14.    Nothing  in  the  scheme  of  the  Code 
suggests that it is to be interpreted as departing from either principle.  The first is

expressly  recognised  in  s  2,  which  states  that  an  act  or  omission  which  renders 
the person doing the act or making the omission liable to punishment is called an 
""offence""15. 

 
A  difficulty  with  the  prosecution's  alternative  case  is  illustrated  by  the 
instructions  in  the  second  column  of  the  flowchart.    On  this  case,  the  omission 
which  caused  the  death  of  the  deceased  was  the  appellant's  failure  to  use 
reasonable care and to take reasonable precautions in his use or  management of 
the gun (the second question).  Nonetheless, the jury was directed that the time at 
which it was necessary to be satisfied that the appellant possessed the intention to 
make  his  omission  murder  was  the  time  the  gun  was  discharged  (the  third 
question).    The  temporal  shift  from  the  negligent  omission  to  the  discharge 
underscores that the intention of which the jury was required to be satisfied was 
unrelated to the negligent failure which caused the death of the deceased.   

Section  23(1)(a)  states  a  general  principle  of  criminal  responsibility  in 

 
these terms:  

""Subject  to  the  express  provisions  of  this  Code  relating  to  negligent  acts 
and omissions, a person is not criminally responsible for – 

(a) 

an act or omission that occurs independently of the exercise of the 
person's will; …"" 

 
A person who causes the death of another, directly or indirectly, is deemed 
to  have  killed  that  other  person16.    A  killing  that  is  not  authorised,  justified  or 
excused  by  law  is  unlawful17.    An  unlawful  killing  is  a  crime  which  is  either 
murder or manslaughter depending on the circumstances of the case18.

The only circumstances in which an unlawful killing constitutes the crime 
of murder are the five circumstances stated in s 302(1); an unlawful killing in any 
other circumstance is manslaughter19.  Relevantly, s 302(1)(a) provides:  

9. 

""Except  as  hereinafter  set  forth,  a  person  who  unlawfully  kills  another 
under any of the following circumstances, that is to say – 

if the offender intends to cause the death of the person killed or that 
of some other person or if the offender intends to do to the person 
killed or to some other person some grievous bodily harm;  

(a) 

…  

is guilty of 'murder'."" 

26 

27 

 
Section 302(1)(a) is not the statement of a free-standing mental element of 
criminal  responsibility  that  can  be  attached  to  a  negligent  act  or  omission.    The 
elements  of  the  offence  of  murder  for  which  s  302(1)(a)  provides  require  the 
prosecution to prove that the unlawful killing was caused by an act or omission 
of the accused that was done or omitted to be done with the intention thereby of 
causing  death  or  some  grievous  bodily  harm 
to  some  other  person.  
Section 302(1) is not an express provision of the Code relating to negligent acts 
or  omissions  for  the  purposes  of  s  23(1)(a):    the  offence  of  murder  is  not 
exempted  from  the  rule  that  a  person  is  not  criminally  responsible  for  an  act  or 
omission that occurs independently of the exercise of the person's will.  

Macdonald  and  Macdonald  provides  no  support  for  the  contrary 
 
conclusion.    Mr  and  Mrs  Macdonald  were  convicted  of  wilful  murder  of 
Mr Macdonald's 14-year-old daughter from a previous marriage in circumstances 
in  which  they  were  found  to  have  intentionally  starved  the  child  to  death  in 
breach  of  the  duty  imposed  by  s  285  of  the  Code  to  provide  her  with  the 
necessaries  of  life20.    As  Lucas  J  observed  in  R  v  Young,  the  conduct  in 
Macdonald  and  Macdonald  involved  a  deliberate,  as  opposed  to  a  negligent, 
breach  of  duty21.    By  contrast,  it  is  incongruous,  as  McMurdo  P  recognised,  to 
attach  a  requirement  for  proof  of  intent  to  conduct  which  is  made  an  offence

because  it  is  conduct  that  falls  short  of  an  objectively  determined  standard  of 
reasonableness22.  

10. 

 
It  was  an  error  of  law  to  leave  the  prosecution's  alternative  case  for  the 
jury's  consideration.    Since  there  is  to  be  a  new  trial  it  is  appropriate  to  say 
something about the trial judge's ruling on the identification of the ""act"" to which 
criminal responsibility attached. 

The act causing death 

 
As  the  appellant's  submissions  in  this  Court  acknowledge,  the  perceived 
need to leave the alternative case in order to ""plug [a] gap"" in the Code was based 
on a misconception that the ""act"" to which criminal responsibility attaches under 
the Code in a firearms case is confined to the act of pulling the trigger or, in the 
case of this gun, the act of releasing the hammer.   

the  act  for 

Identification  of 

the  purpose  of  attributing  criminal 
 
responsibility  for  the  consequences  of  the  discharge  of  a  firearm  has  been 
variously  formulated  in  decisions  concerned  with  the  common  law  requirement 
that  the  accused's  act  is  voluntary23  and  in  the  Griffith  Code  jurisdictions  under 
provisions equivalent to s 23(1)(a)24.   

As Windeyer J observed in Vallance v The Queen, to wound a person by 
 
discharging a firearm is ""a complex act, involving loading the piece, cocking it, 
presenting  it,  pressing  the  trigger""25.    His Honour  returned  to  this  analysis  in 
Ryan v The Queen, observing that26: 

""The  conduct  which  caused  the  death  was  of  course  a  complex  of 
 
acts all done by the applicant – loading the rifle, cocking it, presenting it,

pressing  the  trigger.    But  it  was  the  final  act,  pressing  the  trigger  of  the 
loaded and levelled rifle, which made the conduct lethal."" 

The issue in Ryan was whether a reflex action in pressing the trigger of a 
 
loaded  rifle  which  was  being  pointed  at  the  deceased  was  Ryan's  willed  act.  
Windeyer J  considered  that  phrases  such  as  ""reflex  action""  and  ""automatic 
reaction""  had  no  application  to  the  case  of  a  fully  conscious  man  who  had  put 
himself in a situation  in which he had his finger on the  trigger of a loaded rifle 
levelled at another27.  His Honour held that, in such a circumstance, pressing the 
trigger in an immediate response to a sudden threat did not deprive the act of its 
voluntary character.   

 
Barwick CJ's  preference  was  for  the  discharge  of  the  rifle  as  the  act 
causing death since it would be open to consider that a reflex action, pressing the 
trigger, was not Ryan's willed act28.  Nonetheless, his Honour emphasised that the 
choice of the act causing death is a factual one for the jury29, and it was open to 
find that Ryan's act in presenting the gun in all circumstances might be found to 
be the act causing death.  In their joint reasons, Taylor and  Owen JJ said that it 
was  impossible  to  isolate  the  act  of  pressing  the  trigger  from  the  other 
circumstances and to contend that it alone had caused the death of the deceased.  
Their Honours  doubted  that  it  was  open  to  the  jury  to  conclude  that  the  act 
causing death was other than voluntary30.  This conclusion took into account that 
an  attempt  at  resistance  by  the  deceased  might  have  been  expected.    Menzies J 
rejected that the act causing death could be confined to ""the mere pressing of the 
trigger to discharge the rifle""31.   

34 

The  issue  arose  in  R  v  Falconer  in  the  context  of  a  provision  of  the 
 
Criminal  Code  (WA)  that  is  in  the  same  terms  as  s  23(1)(a).    In  their  joint 
reasons, Mason CJ, Brennan and McHugh JJ rejected that the act causing death is 
confined to ""merely a muscular movement of the accused's body (the contraction

of  the  trigger  finger)""32.    The  ""act""  was  characterised  as  the  discharge  of  the 
loaded gun33.  Falconer was concerned with non-insane automatism and no more 
precise analysis of the act giving rise to criminal responsibility was required.   

As  Gaudron J  observed  in  Murray  v  The  Queen,  to  describe  the  act 
 
causing death in a firearms case as the discharging of the firearm is to conceal a 
number  of  difficulties34.    It  was  Gaudron  J's  analysis  in  Murray  which  led  the 
trial  judge  to  conclude  that  the  ""act""  for  the  purposes  of  attributing  criminal 
responsibility in a firearms case is more narrowly confined under the Code than 
the ""act"" causing death which was considered in Ryan.  The trial judge referred in 
this respect to Gaudron J's statement35:  

""Unlike  s 18(1)  of  the  Crimes  Act  1900  (NSW),  as  it  stood  at  the 
 
time  of  the  decision  in  Ryan,  the  definition  of  murder  in  s 302(1)  of  the 
Code contains no provision permitting a person to be convicted of murder 
simply for an act done with reckless indifference to human life or done in 
an attempt to commit or during or immediately after the commission of an 
act  obviously  dangerous  to  human  life.    Thus,  if  the  act  causing  death  in 
this  case  were  to  be  identified  as  simply  presenting  the  loaded  shotgun, 
that  might  constitute  manslaughter  by  negligent  act,  but  it  would  not 
constitute murder.""  (footnotes omitted) 

 
In  this  passage  Gaudron  J  was  distinguishing  Taylor  and  Owen  JJ's 
conclusion, which it will be recalled took into account that the circumstances in 
which the gun was discharged in Ryan included that an attempt at resistance by 
the deceased might well have been expected36.   

Gaudron J did not suggest that the act causing death in a firearms case was 
 
confined to the pulling of the trigger.  Like Barwick CJ in Ryan, her Honour was 
of the view that ""it is for the jury to determine what act or acts were done by the

accused and whether they  or  any  of  them  caused death""37.    Consistent  with  that 
view,  her  Honour's  analysis  was  posited  on  the  importance  of  considering  the 
operation of s 23(1)(a) in the context of the precise facts of a given case.  Shortly 
stated,  the  facts  on  Murray's  account  of  the  fatal  shooting  were  that  he  was 
holding a loaded rifle at waist height, intending to frighten the deceased, when as 
the result of a sudden movement by the deceased and something striking Murray 
on  the  head,  the  rifle  discharged38.    Far  from  doubting  the  application  of 
Windeyer  J's  analysis  of  the  voluntary  nature  of  the  ""act""  in  Ryan  to  criminal 
responsibility  under  the  Code,  Gaudron  J  expressed  her  preference  for  it39.  
Indeed,  Gaudron J  said  that  the  directions  given  to  the  jury  were  unduly 
favourable  to  the  defence  because  they  excluded  consideration  of  whether,  if 
Murray pressed the trigger as the result of a ""reflex or automatic motor action"", it 
was an unwilled act40.   

38 

Kirby J characterised the relevant ""acts"" in Murray as ""whatever [Murray] 
 
did  to  cause  the  gun  to  discharge""41.    Callinan J  considered  that  everything  that 
had  relevantly  occurred  before  the  ""act"",  including  the  earlier  relations  between 
Murray and his victim, and Murray's acts in  placing himself in the position that 
he  did,  said  much  about  whether  the  act  was  a  willed  act  or  not42.    His Honour 
considered  that  there  may  be  cases  in  which  a  sequence  of  acts  is  so 
interconnected,  or  an  act  in  the  sequence  has  so  inevitable  an  outcome,  that  to 
treat the ultimate act as the ""act"" for the purposes of s 23(1)(a) would be artificial 
and unrealistic43.  Gummow and Hayne JJ in their joint reasons cautioned against 
an  overly  refined  analysis  of  the  ""act"".    Their Honours  observed  that  the 
discharge  of  a  gun  comprises  a  number  of  movements:    loading  it,  cocking  it, 
presenting  it  and  firing  it.    In  their  Honours'  view,  there  was  no  basis  for  a

conclusion  that,  taken  as  a  whole,  the  set  of  movements  in  that  case  was  not 
willed44.   

14. 

 
Whether  it  is  necessary  to  direct  the  jury  in  the  terms  of  s  23(1)(a)  will 
depend upon the facts of the case.  Here, the evidence of the peculiarities of the 
gun was considered to require the direction.  It remains that the determination of 
what  constituted  the  act  causing  death  was  a  factual  one  for  the  jury.    The 
directions  wrongly  confined  the  jury's  consideration  of  the  issue.    The 
unchallenged  evidence  was  that  the  appellant  presented  a  loaded  gun  to  the 
deceased  at  a  distance  of  not  more  than  1.25 metres  and  that  the  resulting 
discharge  could  not  have  occurred  unless  the  appellant  had  exerted  pressure  on 
the  hammer,  pulling  it  back  at  least  to  the  almost  fully  cocked  position.    As 
McMurdo P recognised, it was open to the jury to find that the appellant's actions 
in  loading  the  gun,  presenting  it  to  the  deceased  and  pulling  back  the  hammer 
were  connected,  willed,  acts,  which  caused  the  death  of  the  deceased, 
notwithstanding  that  the  prosecution  had  not  excluded  the  possibility  that  the 
appellant's  finger  slipped  on  the  shortened  spur  of  the  hammer  before  he 
completed  the  action.    In  this  event,  it  was  necessary  for  the  jury  to  consider 
whether  on  the  whole  of  the  evidence  the  prosecution  had  excluded  the 
reasonable  possibility  that the appellant  acted  only  to  frighten the  deceased  and 
not  with  murderous  intention.    Plainly  enough,  the  capacity  of  the  gun  to 
discharge  as  the  result  of  the  appellant's  finger  slipping  from  the  hammer  spur 
was also relevant to the latter determination.

Admissibility of telephone intercept evidence


	
	HIS HONOUR: The accused is on trial for the murder of Mahmoud Hamzy and the infliction of grievous bodily harm upon Omar Ajaj with the intent to inflict grievous bodily harm upon him. There are also charges of manslaughter, as an alternative to the murder count, and of participation in a criminal group.
	


Crown Case


	
	The Crown case is that shortly after midnight on 29 October 2013, the accused and two other men, all of them armed, entered the garage at a residence at 28 Bardo Circuit, Revesby Heights with the intention of killing Mohammed “Hamoudie” Hamzy. At the time Mr Hamzy was in the garage with Mahmoud Hamzy and Mr Ajaj, who were his cousins, and his brother-in-law, Mehmet Yarar. The accused and his two companions fired their weapons. The intended victim, Mohammad Hamzy, and Mr Yarar escaped from the garage but Mahmoud Hamzy was fatally wounded. On the Crown case, the shooters may have mistaken Mahmoud for the intended victim, who was not personally known to them. Mr Ajaj was also wounded but survived.
	
	
	The two men accompanying the accused are alleged to have been Jamal Quami and another man who has become a Crown witness, referred to as witness “L”. It is the Crown case that the three of them travelled to the address at Revesby Heights in a car driven by another person who has become a Crown witness, referred to as witness “M”. After the shootings they were driven from the scene in that car by witness “M”. The three men were dressed in dark clothing and wearing balaclavas to conceal their identity. They are said to have been members of the “Brothers for Life” gang at the time, as was the intended victim, Mohammad Hamzy. The incident appears to have occurred in the context of internecine rivalry between the accused and Mohammed Hamzy, and after the accused had heard that Mohammad Hamzy was out to kill him.
	
	
	The accused had previously been tried for these offences before Hamill J, in a joint trial with other persons who faced further charges. The jury was unable to agree upon verdicts in relation to the accused, and he stands alone before me for re-trial.
	
	
	I received on the voir dire the Crown Case Statement and other material, from which the following emerges. On the day after the shooting, at hospital, the surviving victim, Mr Ajaj, told police that he was sitting in the garage with his companions when a car arrived outside. He saw a passenger in the back jump out and start shooting. Two more people also got out of the car and were shooting. He saw Mahmoud Hamzy being shot in the head and falling to the floor straight away. He also saw one of the men shoot Mahmoud in the head again where he was lying on the ground. He himself was shot in the leg. He was “playing dead” and the men left. As he heard the car drive off, he lifted his head and the “guy in the back seat” saw that he wasn’t dead and “started shooting” at him. The evidence of witness “L” is that the accused occupied the rear seat both before and after the shooting.
	
	
	Mr Ajaj’s statement that the car pulled up outside the garage and the assailants emerged from it is inconsistent with CCTV footage obtained from a camera at 46 Bardo Circuit, some distance from Mr Hamzy’s home. This discloses that the relevant car stopped outside No. 46 and three people, dressed in dark clothing and wearing balaclavas, got out of it. They started walking in the direction of No. 28, the Hamzy residence, followed by the car, which was being driven with its lights off.
	
	
	In evidence at the previous trial, Mr Ajaj resiled from the account he had given to the police in this respect. The effect of that evidence was that the first thing he saw was a man with a balaclava and a gun shooting. He saw that Mahmoud had been shot in the head, he got up and another two shooters ran in, firing their weapons. He said that the car arrived while the shooters were in the garage. He maintained his account of being shot in the leg and of playing dead. He said that he realised the assailants had left when he heard the car door slam. He got up to look and “someone in the back seat” had “shot me again and had got me in the stomach on the side.” In his statement to police Mr Ajaj had not described having been shot in the stomach.
	
	
	Another witness who had been a member of Brothers for Life at the time, referred to as witness “J”, gave evidence at the previous trial that the accused later told him that he “shot a bullet out the car window or something like that...”
	
	
	It is the Crown case that Mr Quami was armed with a .38 calibre pistol with a particular serial number, and the accused had a .38 calibre pistol of a different model with its own serial number. Witness “L” used a .45 pistol, but the weapon has not been recovered and its make and model are unknown. At the previous trial witness “L”, Quami and the accused were referred to as the first, second and third shooters respectively. As I understand it, this was done for convenience and does not indicate any order in which events occurred on the night in question.
	
	
	On post-mortem examination, Mahmoud Hamzy was found to have suffered a number of gunshot wounds, including three to the head. Fired bullets were recovered from two of these wounds, which could be matched ballistically to the pistol used by Quami. The third wound had entry and exit points but no bullet was found, conveying that it had passed through the head. There were a number of other wounds to Mr Hamzy’s body, from some of which were recovered from .45 calibre bullets, the calibre of the pistol used by witness “L”.
	
	
	During surgery on Mr Ajaj, two spent bullets were removed from wounds to his right thigh and right leg, one of which was able to be identified as .45 calibre. There was a wound to his abdomen but no bullet was recovered from it.
	
	
	At the garage, police observed several fired bullets and fired cartridge cases. Significantly for present purposes, four bullets which were found were linked ballistically to the pistol said to have been used by the accused. One was found near the door exiting the garage. The others were in locations consistent with having been fired towards an area where people in the garage had been seated. Two were located in a wall, and another underneath a black hooded jumper on a blood stained area said to be consistent with the position on the ground where Mahmoud Hamzy fell after being shot. The Crown invites an inference to be drawn that that was the bullet which passed through Mr Hamzy’s head.
	
	
	The accused’s position, as it was at the previous trial, is that he was not one of the three shooters and was not present in the vicinity when the shooting occurred.
	


Telephone Intercepts


	
	The accused has remained in custody since his arrest on 27 October 2014. Recently a number of telephone conversations to which he was a party were recorded by police pursuant to a warrant. The Crown prosecutor was of the view that various parts of these conversations are relevant to the matter at hand. In particular, the Crown sought to rely upon passages during conversations on 24 August and 7 September 2017. Counsel for the accused, Mr Driels, objected to this evidence. I rejected the evidence, and these are my reasons for that decision.
	
	
	The conversation of 24 August was between the accused and his brother, Faisal Zarshoy. Relevant for present purposes are two parts of that conversation which, the Crown contends, are related. In the transcript of the conversation the accused appears as “MZ” and his brother as “FZ”. The accused appears to be speaking of communications with his solicitor, Wasim Jabakhangi, about offering the Crown a plea to “GBH with intent”, the accused expressing a preference to offer them up “something low”, presumably meaning a lesser offence. As I understand it, this plea was to be offered in satisfaction of the murder charge. The accused adds:
	


“MZ:   I’m going to call him up and say listen, I had a dream please, Wassim (sic) as my lawyer I am directing you to offer them this deal. If they’re not happy with it offer them something else. If they’re not happy with that we’re we going offer them something else if they’re not happy with that we’re going to take it to trial. But Cuz GBH with intent I recon (sic) they’ll accept it after that I recon hey?”


	
	The conversation continues, with Faisal suggesting what the sentencing outcome might be if the accused were convicted of “GBH with intent” compared to “25 to life” (presumably what he saw as the possible outcome if the accused were convicted of murder).
	
	
	A little later in the conversation the accused speaks about the ballistic evidence. In this context he mentions “L”, and “Ron”, who is Mr Driels. The passage is as follows:
	


“MZ:    But cuz going on the evidence bro I can’t get found guilty on murder … cuz it’s just cuz like Number one, the ballistic for the firearm…they don’t know what gun is what gun and and they reckon the gun… from the first shooter is not the gun from the third shooter, you get it? So they can’t even make out … they can’t even make out which bullet hit here… I swear to God eh. Cuz… they … they can’t even make out um which one is [L's] bullet and which one … you know you think cuz you know gun…gun…analysis… firearm analysis… they’re fuckin’ spot on bro. But This is from Allah… I don’t know bro if this is from Allah … the bullet went straight through the dead person. Do you get it?

FZ:    It went straight through what?

MZ:   The bullet went straight through Mahmoud Hamzy.

FZ:   No way.

MZ:   You know in the last trial, they were trying to say that the bullet that killed Mohmoud (sic) … that the first bullet was from the third gun and Ron was like nah and we had a legal argument.

FZ:    Who’s they alleging had the first gun?

MZ:   Now listen there’s three guns, they think the first ones (sic) Jamil, second ones [L] and they’re trying to say allegedly the third ones mine. They’re trying to say the third 38 was the first one to hit Mohammad but that’s bullshit bro. Of course they’re going to say anything just to bring me down you know what I mean?

FZ:    100%, 100%”


	
	The Crown prosecutor submitted that, viewed in combination, the accused’s expressed willingness to offer a “deal” to the Crown and his comments about the ballistics evidence amount to an admission that he was the third shooter. The Crown prosecutor said that in the second of the quoted passages he appears to be expressing the view that he could not be found guilty of the murder of Mahmoud Hamzy because no bullet found in Mr Hamzy’s body could be linked ballistically to the weapon wielded by the third shooter. Further, the Crown prosecutor argued, he appears to be conveying that it was fortunate for him that a bullet which could be linked to that weapon passed “straight through” Mr Hamzy, and wondering whether this good fortune might be attributable to divine providence. Generally, the Crown prosecutor noted that at no stage in the conversation does the accused assert that he was not present at the time of the shooting, and argued that his expressed interest in the ballistics evidence was because he had been one of the shooters.
	
	
	In the phone call of 7 September the accused was speaking to a person whose identity is unknown. He is referred to in the transcript as “UM”, meaning “unknown male”. That person refers to himself as “one of LC’s boys”. It is common ground that “LC” is a reference to “Little Crazy”, a nickname used for Mohammed Hamzy, the intended victim of the shooting. This man tells the accused that LC had received a message that the accused intended to plead guilty. The accused denies this on several occasions during the conversation. He also says that the Crown had offered him “manslaughter and GBH with intent” but that he had knocked it back, adding that he would not plead guilty to something he hadn’t done.
	
	
	In the passage upon which the Crown relies, the accused discloses that he had met “Wally”, the brother of Mr Ajaj, at Parklea Prison and had asked him to speak to Mr Ajaj on his behalf in the light of the evidence Mr Ajaj had given at the previous trial. The passage is as follows:
	


MZ:   “Yeah that’s right that’s right but I’ve got trial on Monday and umm I spoke to … I saw Wally at Parklea he goes to me how you doin’ brother you Nassar yeah? He goes, I go to him I go listen can you talk to your brother for me. He goes what do you want me to say? Look at the end of the day like … we… we all Muslim you know what I mean? And Omar the last court case like straight out why did he like pretty fucked up straight out.”

UM:   “What did he do?”

MZ:   …like he came he didn’t mention no names and that but just like … he doesn’t need to say what he say you know what I mean? It just looks (ugly?) and (no one) knows the situation. (Hala?)

“Nassar” is a name used for the accused.


	
	The Crown prosecutor again noted the accused’s case that he was not present at the time of the shooting and questioned why, if that were so, he would be concerned about the evidence of Mr Ajaj, who was unable to identify any of the shooters. The Crown prosecutor referred to Mr Ajaj’s departure from his police statement in his evidence at the previous trial when he said that, as the three shooters were leaving in the car, the man in the back seat not only fired his gun in his direction but actually shot him the stomach. He argued that it would be open to the jury to infer from the quoted passage that it was this which was troubling the accused and which led him to ask Wally to approach Mr Ajaj to change his evidence. The fact that he sought to influence the witness in this way, it was said, was because he was indeed the third shooter.
	
	
	As I have said, it is the quoted passage related to Mr Ajaj’s evidence upon which the Crown relies. However, the Crown accepts that if any part of this conversation is to be admitted into evidence, the accused’s protestations of his innocence and declarations that he would not accept a deal offered by the Crown should also be in evidence in fairness to the accused. The Crown prosecutor noted, however, that it is unlikely that the accused would have acknowledged contemplating pleading guilty to anything in this conversation, given that he was speaking to an associate of the intended victim of the shootings.
	
	
	The Crown prosecutor argued that the telephone intercept evidence is significant because of the support it lends to the Crown case, which is otherwise dependent in large part upon the evidence of witnesses who, in different ways, had been themselves involved in the criminal enterprise.
	
	
	As to the first conversation, Mr Driels agreed that the two passages quoted above should be viewed in combination, but he submitted that they do not convey an admission by the accused of involvement in the shooting. Rather, he argued, they should be seen as a discussion by the accused with his brother about the strength of the Crown case in the context of a possible negotiation with the Crown to reduce the charge of murder to a lesser charge in exchange for a plea of guilty. The second passage amounts to the accused’s assessment of the strength of the case against him on murder through an analysis of the ballistics evidence. (Of course, it is not to the point for present purposes that his understanding that he could not be found guilty of murder because no bullet attributable to the gun said to have been used by him was found in the deceased’s body is wrong in law.)
	
	
	Mr Driels pointed out that the accused would have been well aware of the ballistics evidence because he had been provided with a copy of the police brief at an early stage of the proceedings and, of course, he had heard the evidence given at the first trial. Mr Driels argued that the accused may well be interested in negotiating with the Crown even if he were innocent, given that he has been in custody since October 2014 and has been subjected to a lengthy trial at the end of which the jury could not agree upon a verdict in respect of him. Mr Driels added that, if it were found that the evidence of the first conversation could be interpreted as an admission of guilt, it would be necessary to put forward that explanation and this would mean revealing the whole of that procedural history. Mr Driels argued that this would cause the accused unfair prejudice outweighing the probative value of the evidence: s 137 of the Evidence Act, 1995. Alternatively, he argued that for the same reason it would be unfair to the accused to admit the evidence: s 90 of the Act.
	
	
	As to the second conversation, Mr Driels recounted that at the first trial, when he was cross-examining Mr Ajaj about the fact that he had not told police that he had been shot in the stomach by one of the assailants as the car drove away from the scene, Mr Ajaj had lifted his shirt to show that he had indeed been shot in that area. This somewhat dramatic gesture, Mr Driels argued, could have been what the accused was referring to in the conversation when he said, “Omar the last court case like straight out why did he like pretty fucked up straight out”, and when he was asked by the unknown male to explain this, said that Mr Ajaj “doesn’t need to say what he say … it just looks (ugly?) …”. Mr Driels argued that if it were found that this evidence could be interpreted as an admission, it also should be rejected pursuant to s 137 or s 90.
	
	
	I have not found this matter easy to resolve but, having carefully considered the evidence, I accept Mr Driels’ primary submission that the first conversation could not fairly be interpreted as an admission of guilt and is properly seen as the accused’s assessment of the strength of the Crown case against him. This is supported by the fact that when he discusses the ballistics evidence, the accused does not at any stage describe any gun as having been wielded by himself. He speaks of “the third gun”. Indeed, towards the end of that passage he says that “they think the first ones Jamil, second ones [L] and they’re trying to say allegedly the third ones mine”. It is not inconsistent with this stance that he tentatively attributes to divine intervention the fact that a bullet linked to the third gun went “straight through” the victim.
	
	
	Even if this conversation could been seen as open to interpretation as an admission, there is force in Mr Driels’ submission that its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused. In my view, the clearly available competing inference that the accused was doing no more than discussing the strength of the Crown case against him would be relevant to an assessment of the probative value of the evidence. A helpful examination of Court of Criminal Appeal authority on whether regard can be had to competing inferences in assessing the probative value of evidence is to be found in Odgers, Uniform Evidence Law (12th Edition) at [EA.137.90] pp. 1187-1189. The learned author suggests that the issue may require re-examination in the light of the recent decision of the High Court in IMM v The Queen (2016) 257 CLR 300, [2016] HCA 14. French CJ, Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ, referring to the definition of “probative value” in the dictionary to the Evidence Act, said at para [45]:
	


The use of the term ""probative value"" and the word ""extent"" in its definition rest upon the premise that relevant evidence can rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue to different degrees.  Taken by itself, the evidence may, if accepted, support an inference to a high degree of probability that the fact in issue exists.  On the other hand, it may only, as in the case of circumstantial evidence, strengthen that inference, when considered in conjunction with other evidence.  The evidence, if accepted, may establish a sufficient condition for the existence of the fact in issue or only a necessary condition.  The ways in which evidence, if accepted, could affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue are various.  Within the framework imposed by the statute and, in particular, the assumption that the evidence is accepted, the determination of probative value is a matter for the judge.


	
	Left unexplained, the jury would have evidence that the accused, claiming to be innocent, was prepared to negotiate a plea of guilty to a lesser charge in respect of the alleged murder. While lawyers experienced in criminal practice might understand that, it is most unlikely that a jury of lay persons could do so. I agree with Mr Driels that it would require the accused to reveal the procedural history of the matter, including the length of time he had been in custody and the fact that at a previous trial the jury were unable to agree upon a verdict in respect of him.
	
	
	True it is that this means that some members of that jury were not satisfied of his guilt, but it also means that other members of the jury were; so that, in the result, he was not able to secure his acquittal. Even then, although lawyers might understand that an innocent man in jeopardy of conviction of a charge as serious as murder might seek to cut his losses by negotiating with the Crown for a plea of guilty to a lesser offence, a jury, even with appropriate instructions, would still be likely to have great difficulty with that proposition. In the result, the evidence would be unfairly prejudicial to the accused.
	
	
	However, it is unnecessary to express any concluded view about the application of s137 as I am satisfied that the first conversation does not fairly admit of the interpretation which the Crown prosecutor seeks to place upon it.
	
	
	The second conversation raises considerations similar to the first. What the accused was asking Wally to say to Mr Ajaj is obscure. Of course, asking him to speak to his brother about the evidence at all was as foolish as it was improper, but I cannot see fairly implied in it an admission of guilt. Nor do I consider that the two conversations, taken together, could give rise to such an implication. I might add that the second conversation would raise the same issues of prejudice as those identified by Mr Driels in relation to the first conversation.

6267793,Grajewski v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2017] NSWCCA 251,"Judgment


	
	LEEMING JA: Mr Paul Olaf Grajewski was convicted in the Local Court of New South Wales of an offence contrary to s 195(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), and a fine of $1,000 was imposed. Mr Grajewski’s appeal against conviction to the District Court of New South Wales pursuant to s 11 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) was dismissed. No further appeal lies, but s 5B of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) authorises a question of law to be submitted to this Court. That procedure was followed, with a view to this Court determining whether Mr Grajewski’s locking himself to a coal loading machine, such that it was inoperable, was conduct capable of constituting “damaging property” within the meaning of s 195.
	


The case stated to this Court


	
	On Mr Grajewski’s application the primary judge submitted the following facts and questions of law:
	


“FACTS

In determining the appeal against conviction by Paul Olaf GRAJEWSKI on 29 May 2017 I was satisfied of the following beyond reasonable doubt.

1. Paul Olaf GRAJEWSKI was a protestor who attended the Carrington Coal Terminal on 8 May 2016.

2. At 7:50am a machine known as Ship Loader 2 was being used to load a vessel on Dyke 5.

3. Paul Olaf GRAJEWSKI climbed the stairs to the top of Ship Loader 2.

4. As Paul Olaf GRAJEWSKI commenced to climb Ship Loader 2 the machine was shut down due to safety concerns.

5. He then used a harness and roping device to lock himself to Ship Loader 2.

6. He then lowered himself down to about 10 metres above the platform.

7. The actions of Paul Olaf GRAJEWSKI and his position posed a potential risk of serious harm to himself.

8. The machine was inoperable whilst he remained in that position.

9. NSW Police Rescue successfully removed Paul Olaf Grajewski from Ship Loader 2 at approximately 9:40am.

10. Carrington Coal Terminal Ship Loading Operations recommenced at 10:15am.

QUESTION OF LAW FOR DETERMINATION 

The question I now submit is:

Can these facts support a finding of guilt for an offence contrary to section 195(1)(a), Crimes Act, 1900.

In particular, was the evidence capable of proving beyond reasonable doubt that Ship Loader 2 had been damaged by the conduct of Paul Olaf GRAJEWSKI.”


	
	The principal question is framed so as to be confined to a question of law. This Court’s powers in answering it do not include making findings of fact or drawing inferences from facts found by the court below: Lavorato v The Queen (2012) 82 NSWLR 568; [2012] NSWCCA 61 at [8], [52] and [71]. It is not necessary for present purposes to consider the qualifications to that limitation mentioned in The Queen v Rigby (1956) 100 CLR 146 at 151-152; [1956] HCA 38 and Sasterawan v Morris (2007) 69 NSWLR 547; [2007] NSWCCA 185 at [11].
	
	
	Some difficulties arise in relation to the second question. Although framed as being a particular of the first question, it is broader, insofar as it purports to be based on the evidence, rather than the facts stated. What is more, the evidence which was before the primary judge is not before this Court, and so the second question cannot be answered. In the event, nothing turns on this. If, as Mr Grajewski contends, physical damage to “Ship Loader 2” is an element of the offence of which he has been convicted, then the facts stated cannot support his guilt.
	
	
	At various times both parties invited this Court to have regard to the evidence in the District Court. Mr Grajewski contended, on the basis of a paragraph in the witness statement of the manager of the Terminal, that it was the operation of the contingency plan which caused the machine to be shut down. The Crown invited this Court to infer that Mr Grajewski had intended to cause the machine to be shut down. Both submissions must be rejected, as Mr Dawson SC, who appeared with Mr Funnell for Mr Grajewski, and Mr Kell SC, who appeared with Mr Pulsford for the Crown, each acknowledged when they were directed to the limitations of the stated case procedure. This is not an appeal. If there is a deficiency in the facts contained in the stated case, that cannot be cured in this Court. That in turn is a consequence of Mr Grajewski choosing to bring an “all-grounds” appeal to the District Court, from which no further appeal lies, rather than exercising his right of appeal to the Supreme Court on a ground which involves a question of law alone, pursuant to s 52 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, from which a further appeal lies (by leave) to the Court of Appeal: Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW), s 101(2)(h).
	
	
	Both parties’ submissions going beyond the scope of the stated case were directed to the same issue, which relates to the causal connection between Mr Grajewski’s conduct and the inoperability of the machine. On the view I take, nothing turns on the issue. Fact 4 establishes that Ship Loader 2 ceased operations because of a decision in the control room. Fact 5 establishes that, thereafter, Mr Grajewski used a harness and rope to lock himself to the machine, and Fact 6 establishes that he lowered himself so that he was 10 metres above the platform. Fact 8 establishes that the machine was inoperative while he remained in that position. If causing the machine to cease operating by physically affixing himself to it is sufficient to satisfy the offence, then the facts unquestionably were capable of supporting a finding of guilt.
	


The parties’ submissions


	
	Section 195(1) is as follows:
	


“A person who intentionally or recklessly destroys or damages property belonging to another or to that person and another is liable:

(a)   to imprisonment for 5 years, or

(b)   if the destruction or damage is caused by means of fire or explosives, to imprisonment for 10 years.”


	
	Mr Grajewski’s principal submission was simple. It was that the natural meaning of s 195(1) required physical damage to tangible property, which did not extend to causing it to cease to operate where there was no “physical derangement” (to pick up the language used in the authorities). As he put it, “the offence requires that the relevant interference with functionality be the result of some physical derangement or alteration of the property”. He prayed in aid the requirement in s 194(1) that the property be tangible in support of the proposition that the damage must involve a physical derangement. He also invoked the principle that a penal statute should be construed narrowly. And he had the powerful support of the reasons of Simpson J in Director of Public Prosecutions v Fraser & O’Donnell [2008] NSWSC 244, a decision on materially identical facts, where environmental activists chained themselves to the underside of a conveyor belt at a coal loader and were charged with an offence under s 195(1). The DPP’s appeal directly to the Supreme Court was dismissed. Simpson J concluded at [44], after a review of many authorities, that “for a conviction to be made out under s 195, it is necessary that the prosecution establish, even to a limited degree, some physical interference or alteration to the property in question”, and that the application of the locking mechanism, although unauthorised, was not sufficient.
	
	
	Prominent in the Crown’s response were two decisions of this Court, R v Heyne [1998] NSWSC 429 (unreported, 18 September 1998) and Hammond v The Queen (2013) 85 NSWLR 313; [2013] NSWCCA 93. The Crown contended that interference with the operation of the machine per se was sufficient to establish damage.
	
	
	Both parties sought to gain support from a wide-ranging review of local and international authorities on cognate legislation. I acknowledge at the outset the industry of the practitioners acting for both parties in assisting the question to be fully considered. The distinction sought to be maintained by Mr Grajewski was that while it had long been established that partly dismantling property so as to render it inoperative was to injure or damage it, in the present case there was no physical alteration or derangement to Ship Loader 2.
	


The text of s 195


	
	The starting point is to consider the provision in its immediate context. Section 195 is the first provision in Division 2 (“Crimes against property generally”) which is within Part 4AD. Although “property” is defined in s 4 in broad terms, to include “every description of real and personal property; money, valuable securities, debts, and legacies ...”, the first and only section in Division 1 of Part 4AD, s 194, provides in subs (1) that “In this Part, a reference to property does not include a reference to property that is not of a tangible nature”. Subsection 194(4) provides that “damaging property includes removing, obliterating, defacing or altering the unique identifier of the property”. The verb “damages” is not otherwise defined in the statute.
	
	
	Subsection 194(1) is an example of what the High Court in BP Australia Ltd v Bissaker (1987) 163 CLR 106 at 114; [1987] HCA 24 described as an “exclusionary definition”. Its effect (relevantly to s 195(1)) is that the broad definition of “property” in s 4 is confined, such that destroying or damaging property which is not tangible property cannot come within the offence. However, contrary to a submission advanced by Mr Grajewski, the exclusion of intangible property from the scope of “property” says nothing as to the meaning of “damage”, save possibly so as to exclude meanings which could only be applicable to intangible property. Accepting as I do that both “damages” and “property” are to be read in context, and by reference to the exclusionary and enlarging definitions in ss 194(1) and (4), the Legislature has taken a different approach in defining each word, and it would be wrong to extend the exclusion of intangible property so as to confine damage to physical damage.
	


Legislative history


	
	Section 195 and the other provisions in Part 4AD were inserted by the Crimes (Criminal Destruction and Damage) Amendment Act 1987 (NSW). The Attorney General noted in the Second Reading Speech that the provisions in the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) as initially enacted had been drawn from the Malicious Damage Act 1861 (Eng). He observed that:
	


“the new offence of malicious damage to property set out in proposed section 195(1)(a) is similar to the existing offence of malicious injury in s 247 and will carry the same penalty of 5 years’ imprisonment. This is a simple offence of wide application which provides clarity and virtual universal application. It obviates the need to prove a particular type of property, and applies to both living and inanimate objects.”


	
	The Attorney General also said that:
	


“The bill completely overhauls other offences involving criminal damage to property. The bill is the product of an extensive review undertaken by the criminal law review division of my department.” Parliamentary Debates, Legislative Assembly 28 October 1987, p 15343.


	
	The reference to the extensive review is to a Discussion Paper by the Criminal Law Review Division titled “NSW Malicious Injuries to Property Provisions”. After a review of the position at common law, in England and in other Australian States and Territories, that paper contained the following at p 34 under the heading “Proposed Reforms”:
	


“The tide of change in Australia displays a movement from offences based on classification according to types of property to offences against buildings or structures in general, and on to a general offence of criminal damage to property. This movement acknowledges that the culpability of an offender in respect of criminal damage to property is more referable to the mental element of an offender than to types of property damaged.

...

It is proposed that a simple legislative scheme of offences drawn from the UK, Victorian and ACT provisions be enacted, which would incorporate the aggravating factors of dishonesty, use or fire or explosives, and malicious endangerment of life.” (References omitted.)


	
	The report gave the following account of the provision which became s 195:
	


“Offence One: Maliciously destroying or damaging any property (maximum penalty: 5 years’ imprisonment).

Whereas the current s 247 applies only in respect of property which is not the subject of another offence in Part IV Chapter II, the proposed offence would apply generally. A similar offence is found under the UK, Victorian and ACT legislation. The adoption of a simple offence with wide application provides clarity and virtual universal application, removes certain anomalies and obviates the need to provide that a particular type of property is involved. The proposed penalty is in accordance with the current penalty in respect of s 247.”


	
	The term “maliciously” was replaced by a fault element of “intentionally or recklessly” in 2008: see Crimes Amendment Act 2007 (NSW), Schedule 1, items 2, 21. Nothing turns on this for present purposes.
	
	
	The offence of which Mr Grajewski was convicted was wholly statutory. Arson was the only form of injury to property which was an offence at common law. Holdsworth wrote that “All other kinds of damage to property were treated simply as trespasses”: A History of English Law (Methuen & Co Ltd, 5th ed 1966) Vol III p 370. Hence, and from a very early time, criminal statutes were enacted relating to the destruction of property that fell outside the common law offence. One was a 1788 statute of ""breaking into a house or shop or place [and] ... shall wilfully and maliciously break, destroy or damage any frame, machine, engine, tool, instrument or utensil” used in, inter alia, certain textile industries: 28 Geo III c 55. Earlier Tudor statutes are summarised in Blackstone’s Commentaries on the Law of England, Bk IV, ch 17, pp 243-245.
	
	
	One of Sir Robert Peel’s consolidating acts was 7 & 8 Geo IV c 30, sometimes known as the Malicious Injuries to Property Act 1827. That statute was received in New South Wales pursuant to s 24 of the Australian Courts Act 1828 (9 Geo IV c 83), although many of the specific offences (such as damage to canals) had no application to the colony. The 1827 English Act was replaced by 24 & 25 Vic c 97, the work of mid-nineteenth century law reform commissioners, which became known as the Malicious Damage Act 1861 (by reason of the Short Titles Act 1896 59 & 60 Vict c 14). Most of the provisions of the Malicious Damage Act were adopted in New South Wales by Sir Alfred Stephen’s Law Reform Commission in 1871 and ultimately enacted in the colony by the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1883 (NSW): see G Woods, A History of Criminal Law in New South Wales: The Colonial Period 1788-1900 (Federation Press, 2002), pp 248-249. The Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) was a consolidation of that and other colonial statutes. Speaking generally, the other Australian colonies also enacted the 19th century English legislation.
	
	
	The Criminal Damage Act 1971 (UK), enacted following a 1969 working paper and a 1970 report by the Law Commission, repealed the suite of offences created under the Malicious Damage Act 1861 and created a simple offence of “destroying or damaging any property belonging to another intending to destroy or damage any such property”. Legislation based on the 1971 statute was enacted in Victoria by the Crimes (Criminal Damage) Act 1978 (Vic), in the Australian Capital Territory by the Crimes (Amendment) Act (No 4) 1985 (ACT) and, in 1987, in New South Wales.
	
	
	That history discloses two consequences of present importance. The first is that the English and other Australian decisions to which the parties referred were decisions on cognate legislation. The second is that it explains the nature of the 1987 amendments, which were to replace the multitude of particular property damage offences tracing back to the mid-nineteenth century by a smaller number of generally applicable offences. It is helpful to consider the effect of the 1987 amendments in slightly more detail.
	
	
	The suite of nineteenth century offences were located in Chapter II of the Crimes Act 1900 as originally enacted, entitled “Malicious Injuries to Property”. The first section of that chapter was s 194(1), which made reference to “Every act of malicious injury to property punishable under this Act”, and thereafter made general provision extending the various offences to both private property and Crown property, and providing that it was not necessary to prove the existence of malice. Section 196-249 thereafter criminalised various injuries to various types of property. Some of those offences used the verb “damage” but most used “injure”. Many provisions criminalised conduct which “maliciously destroys, or damages” various things (including hopbinds growing on any plantation of hops (s 215), any tree, sapling, shrub or plant, or any underwood (ss 216 and 217); other instances may be seen in ss 219, 224, 225 and 244).
	
	
	The offences most clearly comparable to Mr Grajewski’s conduct expressly referred to the functioning of machines. Sections 209 and 210 provided (emphasis added):
	


“Injuries to manufactures, machinery, &c.

209. Whosoever—

maliciously cuts, breaks, or destroys, or damages, with intent to destroy or render useless, any goods, article, or material, in any stage process, or progress, of manufacture, or any loom, frame, machine, engine, rack, tackle, tool, or implement, whether fixed or movable, prepared for, or employed in, manufacturing, or preparing, any such goods, article, or material, or, by force enters into any building, or place, with intent to commit any such offence,

shall be liable to penal servitude for seven years.

210. Whosoever maliciously cuts, breaks, or destroys, or damages, with intent to destroy, or render useless, any machine, or engine, whether fixed or movable, used, or intended to be used, for performing any agricultural operation, or any machine, or engine, used, or intended to be used, for sheep-washing, wool-pressing, sugar-crushing, cottonginning, or for performing any process connected with the preparation of any agricultural, or pastoral, produce, or with the preservation of meat, or other animal substances, or any appliance, or apparatus, in connection with any such machine, or engine,

shall be liable to penal servitude for five years.


	
	Sections 223 and 224 were also broadly worded, and were as follows (emphasis added):
	


“Injuries to mines.

…

223. Whosoever—

maliciously causes any water to be conveyed, or run, into any mine, or into any subterraneous passage communicating therewith, or maliciously pulls down, fills up, or obstructs, or damages, with intent to destroy, obstruct, or render useless, any airway, waterway, drain, pit, level, or shaft, of or belonging to any mine, with intent in any such case to destroy, or damage, such mine, or to hinder, or delay, the working thereof,

shall be liable to penal servitude for seven years.

224. Whosoever—

maliciously sets fire to, or pulls down, or destroys, or damages, with intent to destroy, or render useless, any engine employed, or about to be employed in sinking, draining, ventilating, or working any mine, or any appliance or apparatus in connection therewith, or any staith, building, or erection, bridge, waggon-way, or trunk, used or intended to be used, in, or about, the business of any mine, whether such engine, staith, building, erection, bridge, waggon-way, or trunk, is completed or unfinished, or maliciously prevents, or obstructs, the working of any such engine, appliance, or apparatus, or

maliciously cuts, breaks, unfastens, or damages, with intent to destroy, or render useless, any rope, chain, or tackle used in any mine, or in or upon any way, or work, employed in, or connected with, any mine, or the business thereof,

shall be liable to penal servitude for seven years.”


	
	Section 232 similarly provided (emphasis added):
	


“Whosoever, by any unlawful act, or wilful omission, or neglect, obstructs, or causes to be obstructed, the passing, or working, of any engine, or carriage, on any railway, or aids, or assists, in any such offence, shall be liable to imprisonment for three years.”


	
	Section 247 (to which the Attorney General compared the new s 195) had provided, as originally enacted:
	


“247 Injuries over five pounds not otherwise provided for.

Whosoever maliciously injures, to an amount exceeding five pounds, any real or personal property whatsoever, either of a public or private nature for which act no punishment is hereinbefore provided, shall be liable to imprisonment for two years, and where such offence is committed in the night, shall be liable to penal servitude for five years.”


	
	The provision was amended three times prior to the 1987 amendment, although without changing its substance. In 1986 s 247 had read:
	


“247 Other injuries

Whosoever maliciously injures any real or personal property whatsoever, either of a public or private nature for which act no punishment is provided in this Chapter, shall be liable to penal servitude for five years.”


	
	Throughout the entirety of its history from 1900 until 1987, s 247 spoke (consistently with the verb predominantly used in this part of the statute) of the crime of maliciously injuring property, which was not caught by any of the preceding, more specific sections.
	
	
	Thus as originally enacted, s 194 referred to “every act of malicious injury to property punishable under this Act”, and one of the last sections, s 247, likewise referred to any malicious injury which had not been the subject of earlier provision. On a natural reading, “injury” and “injures” in a chapter titled “Malicious injuries to property” in the Crimes Act was apt to include all of the particular offences, even those which were not expressed in terms of injuring property, and including those which referred to obstructing the working of a machine or rendering it useless.
	
	
	It will be seen that there was both a structural and a textual change to the legislation in 1987. The “catch-all” provision s 247, which was applicable when no other provision applied, and had been the last provision in this part of the statute, became the first section of the new Part 4AD, and no longer included words “for which act no punishment is provided in this Chapter”. Further, the verb “injures” was replaced by “destroys or damages”. I return to the significance of this after dealing with the authorities.
	


Authority


	
	Both parties referred to an extensive range of Australian, English, Irish and Scottish authority on cognate legislation, it being common ground that there was no authority binding this Court on point. It is convenient to summarise that authority chronologically and geographically, by reference to the legislative measures referred to above.
	


English authority before 1971


	
	R v Tacey (1821) Russ & Ry 452; 168 ER 893 concerned an indictment founded on the offence created by the 1788 statute of 28 Geo III c 55 of “wilfully and maliciously break, destroy, or damage any frame, machine, engine, tool, instrument or utensil” in certain trades including knitting. Mr Tacey had entered a shop and carried away part of a frame used for the making of frame-work knitted stockings, called a “half-dash jack”. The report states that the half-dash jack is a piece of iron, which “is an essential part of the frame, and when taken out, the frame is rendered useless. It may however be taken out, and again replaced, without injury to the frame, and is sometimes so treated, when the frame is taken to pieces to be cleaned.” Objection was taken that the removal of the half-jack was not damaging of the frame. The objection was overruled at Nisi Prius, and the conviction was upheld by what was even at that time known as the Court for Crown Cases Reserved (although the practice of the judges consulting one another informally on a point of law was only formalised in 1848 by 11 & 12 Vict c 78: see Holdsworth, History of English Law Vol 1, p 217). The report states that the judges were:
	


“unanimously of opinion that the taking out and carrying away [of] the piece of iron called the half-jack, was a damaging [of] the frame within the meaning of the 28 Geo III, as it made the frame imperfect and inoperative. They held the conviction right.”


	
	R v Fisher (1865) LR 1 CCR 7 was a unanimous ex tempore decision of the Court for Crown Cases Reserved constituted by Pollock CB, Willes J, Pigott B and Shee and Montague Smith JJ. Mr Fisher was charged with an offence under s 15 of the Malicious Injuries to Property Act 1861 which made it an offence to “unlawfully and maliciously cut, break, or destroy, or damage with intent to destroy or to render useless, any Machine or Engine” used for agriculture or certain manufacturing. The evidence established that (a) the parts had been so tightly screwed so as to prevent the steam engine working, (b) the plug of a pump which supplied the engine boiler with cold water had been taken out and replaced with the wrong side up, preventing water from passing the pump into the boiler, and (c) that another pipe to the boiler had been stopped up by a piece of stick being thrust up it, so that, even supposing that water could have passed through the plug, it could not have got through the pipe into the boiler. It was also admitted that when the working parts of the engine had been loosened, the plug taken out and properly replaced, and the obstruction from the pipe had been removed, “the engine was just as good as before”. The Chairman of Quarter Sessions directed the jury that preventing the machine from working was “doing damage”, and the jury convicted. The Chairman reserved a question of law for the consideration of the Court for Crown Cases Reserved:
	


“Whether, upon the facts stated, the temporary injury to the engine was such a malicious damage as to bring the prisoner under the penalties of the statute, and whether the prisoner was property convicted.”


	
	The Court affirmed the conviction and said:
	


“It is like the case of spiking a gun, where there is no actual damage done to the gun, although it is rendered useless. The case falls within the expression ‘damage with intent to render useless’. Can it be said that the machine was not damaged, when it was placed in such position that, if water had gone on boiling, the boiler would have burst? Moreover, great injury may be done to a machine by the displacement of its parts; and in this case, until the parts were replaced, the machine was useless. Surely the displacement of the parts was a damage within the fifteenth section, if done with intent to render the machine useless.”


	
	There were thus two aspects of the reasoning: (a) doing something with no actual damage to the machine which rendered it useless because, if it were used, it would have been physically destroyed, and (b) displacement of the parts of the machine, which, until replaced, was rendered useless. However, as Mr Grajewski emphasised, s 15 made it an offence to “damage with intent to destroy or to render useless”, which is differently worded from s 195(1).
	
	
	Tacey and Fisher were applied by Black LJ, sitting as a Judge of Assize in Getty v Antrim County Council [1950] NI 114. The offending conduct was the unscrewing of two Ford Ferguson ploughs, and taking away vital parts of them, without doing any damage to the parts left behind, and the submissions descended to the detail of the textual differences between the earlier legislation and s 5 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898, which referred to “maliciously setting fire to, destroying, or injuring property”. The submission was made that the word “injury” bore a narrower meaning than the word “damage” considered in Tacey and Fisher.  Black LJ said:
	


“I cannot accept this contention. To my mind, the distinction which Mr Babington seeks to draw is much too fine, and I do not think that any such distinction was in the mind of the Legislature. If the dismantling of a machine constitutes a damage to the machine under the wording of section 15 of the Act of 1861 it equally, in my opinion, constitutes an injury to the machine under the wording of s 5(1) of the Act of 1898.”

English authority on the Criminal Damage Act 1971


	
	As noted above, s 1 of the Criminal Damage Act 1971 (UK) replaced a large number of specific offences by a general provision:
	


“A person who without lawful excuse destroys or damages any property belonging to another intending to destroy or damage any such property … shall be guilty of an offence.”

Property was defined in s 10(1) of the 1971 Act to mean “property of a tangible nature, whether real or personal …”.


	
	In A (“a Juvenile”) v The Queen [1978] Crim LR 689, the Kent Crown Court allowed an appeal following evidence that A had spat upon a police sergeant’s raincoat. The appeal appears to have proceeded on the bases that “damage” extended to “rendering imperfect or inoperative”, and held that the raincoat, being designed to resist the elements, was not damaged by the spittle, nor was it “rendered inoperative (if it was ‘inoperative’, it was solely on account of being kept as an exhibit)”. The Court distinguished between spitting on a raincoat and spitting on a garment such as a satin wedding dress; in the latter, any attempt to remove the spittle might in itself leave a mark or stain, and it was said that an article “might also have been rendered ‘inoperative’ if, as a result of what happened, it had been taken to dry cleaners.” Although the precedential authority of the decision is limited (see P Allsop, A Ashworth and S Nicholas (eds), “The Binding Effect of Crown Court Decisions” [1980] Crim LR 402), it will be seen below that the decision has been quite influential.
	
	
	R v Henderson and Battley is an unreported decision of the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) given on 29 November 1984 concerning the unlawful dumping of 30 lorry loads of soil, rubble and mud onto a development site. Cantley J, giving judgment of the Court, observed that “whether damage was done to this land was a question of fact and degree for the jury”. The trial judge’s direction was that “damage” under s 1 of the Criminal Damage Act 1971 “just bears its ordinary everyday meaning”. The trial judge added that damage “includes even the temporary rendering of the land less usable, or, indeed, not usable: adversely affecting its character for the purpose for which the owner had it.” Cantley J considered that the direction was “completely in accordance with good sense and with the principle exemplified in” Fisher.
	
	
	In Morphitis v Salmon [1990] Crim LR 48 the Queen’s Bench Divisional Court (Lloyd LJ and Auld J) found that s 1 of the Criminal Damage Act 1971 extended to “permanent or temporary impairment of value or usefulness”, although on the facts of the case the removal of a scaffold bar and clip fell outside the scope of that provision.
	
	
	In R v Fiak [2005] EWCA Crim 2381, the Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal against conviction of criminal damage to a blanket and a police cell. The appellant had been arrested and was placed in a cell. He placed a blanket down the lavatory and flushed it repeatedly, causing his own cell and two adjoining cells and the passage to become flooded. The Court said at [8] that:
	


“The blanket was wet, but not visibly soiled, and the water which caused flooding was clean water from the lavatory fallen onto a waterproof cell floor. However, the water made the blanket unusable until it was cleaned and dry, and the cells themselves were cleaned by a contract cleaner before they were available to the police for normal use.”


	
	The Court relied upon what had been said in Morphitis v Salmon [1990] Crim LR 48, where Auld J had said that the term “damage” for the purpose of this provision should be “widely interpreted so as to include not only permanent or temporary physical harm, but also permanent or temporary impairment of value or usefulness”. The Court concluded at [20] that:
	


“… [W]hile it is true that the effect of the appellant’s actions in relation to the blanket and the cell were both remediable, the simple reality is that the blanket could not be used as a blanket by any other prisoner until it had been dried out (and, we believe, also cleaned) and the flooded cells remained out of action until the water was cleared. In our judgment it is clear that both sustained damage for the purposes of the 1971 Act.”

Australian decisions outside New South Wales


	
	In Griffiths v Morgan (unreported, Supreme Court of Tasmania, 13 October 1972) Neasey J determined an appeal by way of rehearing under s 113 of the Justices Act 1959 (Tas). Mr Griffiths was charged under s 37(1) of the Police Offences Act 1935 (Tas), which simply provided that “No person shall unlawfully destroy or injure any property”. The offending conduct was that he had released either saliva or water or both into the mouthpiece and sample tube of breath analysing equipment. There was evidence that the machine was inoperative for returning a correct reading and had to be sent to Hobart to be dismantled and cleaned out. However, there was no evidence that any parts of the machine were damaged, or that when cleaned out and put together, it was not fully operative. Neasey J said:
	


“However, to cause the machine to become inoperative until it was cleaned and adjusted was, in my opinion, to injure it within the meaning s 37(1) of the Police Offences Act 1935. To injure property is, to adopt the most apt of the meanings given in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary, ‘to do hurt or harm to; to damage’.


	
	His Honour then relied upon what had been held in Tacey and Fisher. He concluded:
	


“In my opinion, a rendering of the breath analysis machine temporarily useless, which the appellant did by his action, was unlawfully to injure it.”


	
	In Samuels v Stubbs (1972) 4 SASR 200, Walters J in the Supreme Court of South Australia heard a Crown appeal from the dismissal of a charge of damaging property contrary to s 43 of the Police Offences Act 1953 (SA). The accused kicked and crushed a police officer’s cap whilst he was being arrested. He observed that the meaning of the word “damage” must be controlled by its context: at 203, and that the term “damage” may not necessarily “be employed interchangeably with the term ‘injury’ with reference to mischief wrongfully occasioned to the person”. He concluded however that “it is sufficient proof of damage if the evidence proves a temporary functional derangement of the particular article of property”, and drew a distinction between damage to property and the consequent loss or damage to the owner of it. Consequently, the appeal was allowed and the respondent was convicted.
	
	
	Samuels v Stubbs was approved in the Bristol Crown Court in Hardman v The Chief Constable of Avon & Somerset Constabulary [1986] Crim LR 330, holding that specially mixed unstable whitewash which was soluble in water, which was used to paint human silhouettes on an asphalt pavement on an anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing, did damage, notwithstanding that the markings washed away and would eventually be eradicated by rain and pedestrian traffic. It was said to be sufficient that markings had caused expense and inconvenience to the local authority.
	
	
	The joint judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal of Queensland in R v Zischke [1983] Qd R 240 arose from a conviction of wilfully and unlawfully damaging property in the night time contrary to s 469 of The Criminal Code. The Court said at 243 that the question was one of mixed fact and law: whether spraying paint on buildings and other structures amounted to damage. Mr Zischke was permitted on appeal to contend that there was damage done “only if the structure or substance of some part of the subject property had been deranged” and that the application of an adhesive substance or (and/or) a penetrant, without more, does not constitute such damage.” The Court reviewed a large number of decisions, including Tacey, Fisher and Getty. Its conclusion at 246 was:
	


“What emerged from a review of the decisions is that ‘damage’ may be held to have been done even though the injury to the article of property is not permanent but is remediable, if only by the expenditure of money. Probably the formula that most nearly embraces all the attempts at definition is that a thing is damaged if it is rendered imperfect or inoperative: see ‘A’ (a juvenile) v The Queen [1978] Crim LR 689.”


	
	Two further things may be noted. The first is that their Honours observed that it was correct for the trial judge to leave open to the jury to determine as a fact whether or not by applying paint the accused had damaged the property to which it was applied. The second is that s 460 of the Code included a definition which extended to obliterating or rendering illegible certain things. The court said that that inclusive definition could not be relied upon as a legislative indication that, apart from that definition, a narrow meaning of damages was intended in relation to s 469.
	


New South Wales decisions


	
	The force of this Court’s reserved decision in R v Ian Eric Heyne (18 September 1998, Handley JA, James and Levine JJ) may have been diminished by the way in which it has been made available. It is not reported in any series of law reports. It is not presently on Caselaw. It is available amongst the decisions collected on “Butterworths unreported cases”, where it is BC9807961 and the appellant’s name is misspelt as Hayne. I have used the original hardcopy version published by the Court, which is accurately reproduced in the version published electronically by AustLII. The headnote includes the proposition:
	


“Despite the technicalities of the doctrine of unlawful and dangerous act in this case (notably ‘temporary functional derangement’), the trial Judge's directions to the jury were correct.”


	
	Mr Heyne appealed against his conviction and sentence for manslaughter. Following an argument with his wife, he had obtained a can of petrol and splashed it around the living room of his house. The petrol ignited. The appellant was able to escape, but his wife was trapped and died. The Crown case included that Mr Heyne caused her death by an unlawful and dangerous act, the unlawful act being malicious damage to property. The judge’s directions identified three bases in which that offence may have been made out:
	


“The wetting of the carpet with petrol, which is only temporary, any permanent staining of the carpet from the petrol, and what was referred to as the temporary functional derangement of the house because of the presence of the petrol.”


	
	Handley JA, with whom Levine and James JJ agreed, was critical of issues that had been left to the jury, but nevertheless dismissed the appeal, which included a ground that the jury had been misdirected on the ways in which they might find the offence of malicious damage to property made out. His reasons included this passage:
	


“… [T]he Judge directed [the jury], as he was bound to, that it was open to them to find that the pouring of the petrol may have been unlawful because it caused a ‘temporary functional derangement’ of the house, making it unusable until the vapour dispersed.

In Samuels v Stubbs (1972) 4 SASR 200, Walters J held that the respondent, who had stamped on a policeman’s hat during a demonstration and temporarily put it out of shape, could be convicted of wilful damage to property, ‘temporary functional derangement’ being sufficient for this purpose. Mr Norrish QC submitted that this case should not be followed, but I see no reason to doubt its correctness. It is cited without criticism in Johnson & Howie, “Criminal Practice and Procedure (NSW)”, para 8820.20, and in Watson, Blackmore and Hosking, “Criminal Law (NSW)”, para 2.27710, and is consistent with other authority. This includes Hardman v Chief Constable of Avon [1986] Crim LR 330-1 (whitewashing footpath damage although rain would eventually wash it away) and Morphitis v Salmon [1990] Crim LR 48, 49 where Lloyd LJ and Auld J said:

‘Whether damage … was caused in the particular case was a question of fact and degree and could be of various kinds … It included not only permanent or temporary physical harm but also permanent or temporary impairment of value or usefulness.’

This challenge therefore fails.”


	
	The affirmation of a temporary functional derangement constituting damage was part of the ratio of the decision. It could not be known which path or paths left open to them had been followed by the members of the jury, and so if what had been said about a temporary functional derangement was incorrect in law, the verdict would prima facie be unsafe: see for example Osborne v R; R v Osborne [2017] NSWCCA 11 at [133]. Mr Grajewski sought to distinguish this decision on the basis that the petrol (being a liquid) seeped into the carpet, thereby physically interfering with it, while Mr Grajewski and his harness and roping device were merely attached to the surface of Ship Loader 2.
	
	
	Justice Simpson in Director of Public Prosecutions v Fraser & O’Donnell [2008] NSWSC 244 appears not to have been referred to Heyne. Her Honour reviewed many of the earlier authorities, and held that the protesters’ locking themselves to the machinery did not constitute the requisite physical interference with property. However, both Heyne and Fraser & O’Donnell were considered by this Court in Hammond v The Queen (2013) 85 NSWLR 313; [2013] NSWCCA 93, when Slattery J reviewed all of the decisions mentioned above, save for Griffiths v Morgan, in the context of a conviction under s 195(1) for spitting on a stainless steel seat while the offender was being held in custody. His Honour was asked to follow the narrower approach taken by Simpson J, and concluded as follows at [68]-[69]:
	


“But it is not strictly necessary to decide this question in these reasons because of the approach taken below in relation to the findings in the stated case: that the findings neither establish physical damage nor functional interference with the seat.

But were it necessary to decide the question I would respectfully differ from the approach that Simpson J took in Fraser, and conclude that the course of authority in both England and Australia now supports the conclusion that interference with functionality of the property in question alone, even without physical harm to or ‘derangement’ of the property is sufficient to establish ‘damage’ within the Crimes Act, s 195. In my opinion this conclusion is justified on the various judicial formulae of what constitutes ‘damage’ developed in the course of authority. Both Zischke and A (a Juvenile) allow physical harm (‘imperfect’) and functional interference (‘inoperative’) as alternative paths to establishing a finding of criminal damage. Samuels v Stubbs also approved in this court in Hayne [sic], allow that ‘temporary functional derangement’ is alone a sufficient basis for a finding of criminal damage. And Morphitis v Salmon, Henderson & Battley and Whiteley allow the establishing of ‘physical harm’ and ‘impairment of value or usefulness’ as separate paths to a finding of criminal damage.”

Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J agreed. The decision was applied by R A Hulme J in Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Lucas [2014] NSWSC 1441 allowing an appeal from the Local Court which had dismissed a charge under s 195(1) based on letting air out of a vehicle’s tyre.

Consideration


	
	If one were to put to one side context, purpose and existing authority, there is force in the conclusion reached by Simpson J that the words “destroys or damages” in s 195(1) require a physical interference or alteration to the property. Mr Grajewski also invoked the principle against giving a broad construction to a penal provision, applied in Stevens v Kabushiki Kaisha Sony Computer Entertainment (2005) 224 CLR 193; [2005] HCA 58 at [45]:
	


“[I]n choosing between a relatively broad and a relatively narrow construction of legislation, it is desirable to take into account its penal character. ... An appreciation of the heavy hand that may be brought down by the criminal law suggests the need for caution in accepting any loose, albeit ‘practical’, construction of Div 2A itself.”


	
	Although it was at the forefront of his written submissions, the principle invoked by Mr Grajewski does not exclude the ordinary rules of construction: Waugh v Kippen (1986) 160 CLR 156 at 164; [1986] HCA 12. Indeed, Gibbs J’s qualified observation in Beckwith v The Queen (1976) 135 CLR 569 at 576 that the “rule is perhaps one of last resort” has much more recently been reiterated in unequivocal terms: by Nettle and Gordon JJ in Re Day [No 2] [2017] HCA 14; 91 ALJR 518 at [276] and in the joint judgment in Aubrey v The Queen [2017] HCA 18; 91 ALJR 601 at [39]. I do not for a moment understand the High Court, by referring to “rules” and “last resort”, to be implying that the task of ascertaining the legal meaning of a statute is mechanistic, to be determined by the application of rules, amongst which the penal character of the statute is the last to be invoked. The process is considerably more nuanced, reflecting as it does the constitutional relationship between the various arms of government: Zheng v Cai (2009) 239 CLR 446; [2009] HCA 52 at [28]. As was express in the passage from Stevens v Kabushiki Kaisha Sony Computer Entertainment reproduced above – a statute’s penal character is to be regarded as a very minor consideration to be taken into account in ascertaining its legal meaning in light of its text, context and purpose.
	
	
	But the task of ascertaining the legal meaning of s 195(1) cannot disregard context, purpose and authority. I respectfully disagree with the conclusion reached by Simpson J for the following reasons.
	
	
	First, Simpson J did not have the benefit of this Court’s decisions in Heyne and Hammond. The former is ratio; the latter is obiter but is fully reasoned following detailed argument on the point. Not lightly would this Court now adopt a construction which is inconsistent with both those earlier decisions on the same section.
	
	
	Secondly, the legislative history confirms a construction whereby “destroys or damages” includes physical interference which obstructs the working of a machine or renders it useless, either permanently or temporarily. There were formerly specific offences applicable to industrial or agricultural machines, mines and railway engines which used that language, namely, ss 209, 210, 223, 224 and 232 of the Crimes Act 1900 as originally enacted. All those offences were contained in a chapter entitled “Malicious Injuries to Property” and ss 194 and 247 confirmed that “injures” had a broad meaning which extended to obstructing machinery and rendering machinery useless. There is nothing to suggest that the general provision which replaced those nineteenth century specific offences, which used “destroys or damages” rather than “injures”, was any narrower. The reasoning of Neasey J in Griffiths v Morgan on the Tasmanian legislation referring to “unlawfully destroy or injure any property” supports that conclusion.
	
	
	Further, once it is ascertained that “destroys or damages” extends to physical interference which causes property to be inoperable, there is no straining of the language if a machine is damaged so that it is rendered temporarily inoperable. The distinction observed in s 195 between “destroys” and “damages” is apt to distinguish between property which is rendered permanently inoperable and property which is only rendered temporarily inoperable.
	
	
	Thirdly, this Court is required to prefer a construction which promotes the legislative purpose: Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW), s 33. The purpose of s 195 was to replace a large number of nineteenth century offences with a single offence of generality which extended at least so far as the sections it was replacing. The Minister introducing the 1987 bill described s 195 as “a simple offence of wide operation”, and there is nothing in any of the extrinsic materials to suggest that the simplified structure brought about the result that conduct which had formerly been criminal was now outside the Act. That is to say, Mr Grajewski’s construction is contrary to the command in s 33 of the Interpretation Act.
	
	
	Fourthly, the very considerable weight of authority now supports a broader approach. Tacey, Fisher, Henderson, Morphitis and Fiak are English appellate decisions on cognate language. Further, Griffiths v Morgan, Samuels v Stubbs and R v Zischke are carefully reasoned decisions on similar statutes. To the extent that Mr Grajewski sought support from A (“a Juvenile”) v The Queen I would note that the raincoat was not rendered inoperative by being spat on, and it was that fact which was regarded as decisive.
	
	
	Mr Grajewski submitted that “damage” has, in the criminal context, “never been previously understood as being constituted by interference with functionality alone”. This may be accepted. It is not necessary to go so far as this Court stated, obiter, in Hammond, namely that interference with functionality of property even without physical harm or derangement is sufficient to satisfy s 195. The Crown submitted that a protester who lay down in front of a bulldozer, intending to prevent its operation, would contravene s 195 in its application to the bulldozer. I would not accept that submission, just as I would not accept that a false threat that a bomb had been left in a factory would contravene s 195 (the latter would be an offence contrary to s 199). Although in both cases the effect may be to render the machinery inoperative, I think consistently with the legislative text and purpose and authority that there must be some physical interference with the property. That is to say, I think there is a material difference between a protester who ties herself to the wheel or to the blade of a bulldozer, and the protester who lays down in front of the bulldozer. In both cases the operator may be prevented from using the bulldozer, but only in the former cases is there the combination of physical interference and temporary inoperability which satisfies the “destroys or damages” element of the offence.
	
	
	That said, Mr Grajewski’s submissions to distinguish Heyne are unpersuasive. There is nothing to suggest that s 195 involves distinctions between petrol seeping into a fabric causing a dwelling to be temporarily unusable and a protester attaching himself to the outside of a machine causing it to be temporarily unusable. Once the conclusion is reached that physical interference causing property to be inoperable falls within the section, there is no occasion to imply fine distinctions based on precisely how that is achieved. It would seem absurd if, say, letting out the air in a vehicle’s tyre was an offence under s 195(1) but attaching a wheel clamp was not. And how are cases like R v Henderson and Battley (rubble on a building site) and R v Zischke (paint on a building) to be reconciled with the facts of the present case? Constructions which yield improbable or capricious results are to be avoided on settled principles of statutory interpretation: see Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1981) 147 CLR 297; [1981] HCA 26 at 321.
	
	
	There may in some cases be questions of fact and degree. I agree with what was said in this respect in “A” (a juvenile): spit on a raincoat may not involve damage, whereas spit on a satin wedding dress may. The same point was made in R v Zischke. Such differences are outside the limited scope of the question reserved to the Court pursuant to s 5B of the Criminal Appeals Act. They do not presently arise, because the stated cases establishes that Mr Grajewski’s physical presence attached to Ship Loader 2 caused the machine to continue to be inoperable for some two hours.
	
	
	Finally, Mr Grajewski relied, albeit weakly, on the enactment of the Inclosed Lands, Crimes and Law Enforcement Legislation Amendment (Interference) Act 2016 (NSW), which commenced shortly after the offence. The new aggravated offence of unlawful entry onto inclosed lands applies where a person on inclosed lands on which a business or undertaking is conducted “interferes with, or attempts or intends to interfere with, the conduct of the business or undertaking” or “does anything that gives rise to a serious risk to the safety of the person or any other person on those lands”. True it is that the new offence would appear, on its face, to have applied to Mr Grajewski’s conduct. However, I fail to see how that statute could have any bearing upon the legal meaning of s 195(1) at a time before it came into force. Mr Dawson did not seek to apply the new legislation directly, but only indirectly as a response to a submission from the Crown, and acknowledged that “it not being in force at the time, it is difficult to have regard to it as a principle of statutory construction”. The later statute which was not in force says nothing as to the meaning of the statute which was in force.
	


Orders


	
	For those reasons, I propose that the questions reserved be answered “Yes” and “Inappropriate to answer”.
	
	
	There is power to order costs on a stated case (see for example Smith, Robert Arthur v Alison Byrne (New South Wales Electoral Commission) [2017] NSWCCA 35 at [18]) but when this was raised the Crown Advocate confirmed that he made no application for costs.
	
	
	JOHNSON J: I agree with Leeming JA.
	
	
	ADAMSON J: I agree with Leeming JA.

6267807,R v Bartuccio [2017] NSWDC 286,"Judgment

INDICTMENT


	
	The accused, Mr Vincenzo Bartuccio, has been arraigned on an indictment dated 17 October 2017, that he, contrary to s 7A(1) of the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW) [1] :
	


On 8 December 2016 at Rossmore in the State of New South Wales, did possess a firearm, namely a .22 long rifle calibre/20 gauge Savage Arms model 24H-DL combination rifle/shotgun, not being authorised to do so by a licence or permit.


	
	The accused pleaded not guilty to that charge.
	


JUDGE ALONE TRIAL


	
	As this is a judge alone trial, s 133(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) requires me to state the principles of law to be applied, as well as findings of fact which are made. s 133(3) of the same Act states that where the law requires a warning to be given to a jury, I must take the warning into account in dealing with the matter.
	
	
	I approach these statutory obligations in accordance with the statements made in both Fleming v R [2]  and Filippou v The Queen. [3] 
	


DIRECTIONS

The presumption of innocence


	
	The accused is entitled to the presumption of innocence. He has pleaded not guilty to the charge and has elected to proceed to a trial by Judge alone – it is my duty and responsibility to consider whether he is guilty or not guilty of the charge and to return my verdict according to the evidence.
	
	
	The accused is not required to prove his innocence. The accused is presumed to be innocent of the crime charged unless the evidence led in the trial satisfies me to the appropriate standard that he is guilty of the crimes.
	
	
	During the trial, the accused has been bail refused. There is also evidence before me in agreed facts pursuant to s 191 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) that on 8 December 2016, enquiries by police revealed that the accused was subject to bail. In relation to the matters the subject of this trial, no adverse inference is to be drawn against the accused by reason of his bail status or any charge to which it relates.
	


Onus and standard of proof


	
	The prosecution bears the onus of proof, from the beginning to the end of the trial, to establish the guilt of the accused. The accused bears no onus and is not required to prove anything in the trial, with the exception of the defence that it has raised under s 4A(1) of the 1996 Act in circumstances that I will later come to.
	
	
	The standard of proof is beyond reasonable doubt. Those words have their ordinary English meaning. It is not enough for the Crown to show suspicion of guilt or to demonstrate that the accused is probably guilty.
	
	
	The matters that the Crown needs to establish beyond reasonable doubt are the essential elements of the offence. In the circumstances of this trial, the critical questions are whether the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused (1) possessed a prohibited firearm, namely, the .22 long rifle calibre/20 gauge Savage Arms model 24H-DL combination rifle/shotgun; and (2) that the accused was not authorised to do so by a licence or permit.
	
	
	However, the Crown is not required to prove the truth and reliability of every disputed fact nor to answer every question that might be posed concerning the evidence in the case.
	
	
	In a criminal trial the only one ultimate issue is: Has the Crown proved the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt? If the answer is “yes”, the appropriate verdict is “guilty”. If the answer is “no”, the verdict must be “Not Guilty”.
	
	
	In this case, the Crown relies on the extended definition of “possession” contained in s 4A(1) of the 1996 Act based on the assertion that it has established that on 8 December 2016 the firearm was on the premises occupied by the accused. The Defence disputes that the Crown has established occupation however in the alternative raises the Defence provided 4A (1) (b) and (c) of the Act. This has been described as a “reverse onus” that is “cast upon the [accused]”. [4]  This defence for it to succeed must be established on the balance of probabilities. [5] 
	


Dispassionate approach


	
	It is necessary to consider the evidence in the trial impartially and dispassionately. The Court must not let sympathy or emotion affect its judgment.
	
	
	In the same manner as required of a jury, I will approach the assessment of evidence in this trial in a dispassionate manner and without emotion or sympathy and without any element of prejudice.
	


Election not to give evidence


	
	In this case, the accused has not given evidence. The only witness called by the Defence was Mrs Evagelia (Julia) Bartuccio – the accused’s wife.
	
	
	As I have already noted, the Crown bears the onus of satisfying me beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of the offence charged.
	
	
	Subject to what I have earlier referred to, the accused bears no onus of proof.
	
	
	In respect of any fact that is in dispute he is presumed to be innocent until I have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt by the evidence led by the Crown that he is guilty of the offence charged.
	
	
	As a matter of law, the accused’s decision not to give evidence cannot be used against him in any way at all during the course of my deliberations. That decision cannot be used as amounting to an admission of guilt. I must not and I do not, draw any inference or reach any conclusion based upon the fact that the accused decided not to give evidence. I cannot use that fact to fill any gaps that I might think exist in the evidence tendered by the Crown. It cannot be used in any way as strengthening the Crown case or in assisting the Crown to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	In particular the Court is not to speculate about what might have been said in evidence if the accused had given evidence.
	


Accused did not participate in an interview


	
	I further observe that the accused was offered the opportunity to participate in an electronically recorded interview with police. The accused declined this opportunity.
	
	
	That is, Mr Bartuccio chose not to answer questions put to him by the police at the time of his arrest. All people in this country have a right to silence — that is, to choose not to answer questions put to them by the police. That is what the police officer told him when he was asked if he wanted to answer their questions. This is referred to in Exhibit A by reference to the caution. There are some exceptions to this right, but those exceptions do not apply here.
	
	
	In this case, it would be quite wrong if the accused, having listened to what the police said, and having decided to exercise his right to silence, later found that I were to use that fact against him. I must not do that and it is important, therefore, that I bear in mind that his silence cannot be used against him in any way at all. The fact that he took note of the caution given by the police and chose to remain silent cannot be used against him. Under our law, an accused person has a right to silence.
	


Inferences


	
	I may in my role as the Judge of the facts, draw inferences from direct evidence. I may only draw an inference adverse to the accused from proven facts if such inference is a reasonable inference that can be properly drawn from those facts. There are, however, surrounding circumstances from which the Crown seeks that inferences be drawn from established facts to draw a conclusion as to the existence of further facts. To the extent that such aspects of the case rely upon circumstantial evidence it is necessary to state and apply some fundamental principles.
	
	
	Just how convincing and reliable a circumstantial case is will depend upon the number and nature of the basic facts relied upon by the Crown when considered as a whole and whether all of the evidence leads to an unavoidable conclusion that the Crown has established the guilt of the accused. It is important that the circumstantial aspect of the case be approached by considering and weighing as a whole all of the facts established by the evidence. If such a conclusion does not reasonably arise, then the Crown circumstantial case fails.
	
	
	If, however, a conclusion of guilt is a reasonable one to draw based upon a combination of the established facts then, before the Court can convict the accused, it must be determined whether there is any other reasonable conclusion arising from the facts that is consistent with the conclusion that the Crown says is established. If there is any other reasonable conclusion arising from those facts that is inconsistent with the guilt of the accused, the circumstantial case fails because the Court would not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the accused’s guilt.
	
	
	The Court must not base its conclusion upon mere speculation, conjecture, or supposition.
	


Circumstantial case – links in a chain


	
	Following on from that direction, the Crown asks me to draw an inference or conclusion of guilt that the accused possessed the firearm in question beyond reasonable doubt from the facts in this case.
	
	
	It will not be open to me to come to a conclusion favourable to the Crown unless I were first to find as a fact that the subject firearm was on the premises occupied by the accused on 8 December 2016 This is because the Crown relies on the extended definition under s 4A(1) of the 1996 Act, and it must satisfy me beyond reasonable doubt that the accused occupied the premises where the firearm was located. I will later outline the various pieces of evidence that the Crown relies on in order to prove this fact.
	
	
	As that fact is essential to my coming to a conclusion in favour of the Crown — because the Crown must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt — then I would first have to be satisfied as to the existence of that particular fact beyond reasonable doubt. [6]  This particular fact must be proved beyond reasonable doubt not because it alone proves the guilt of Mr Bartuccio but because it is an essential step in the reasoning that the Crown asks me to follow in order to establish its case.
	
	
	As I have already said, in relation to facts which are not essential to my process of reasoning, I would not consider those facts I find established by the evidence in isolation, but I would have regard to them as a whole.
	
	
	If I were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the existence of the essential fact, then I can take that fact together with all the other facts I find established and ask myself whether I can draw an inference or conclusion in favour of the Crown from those facts considered as a whole. If such a conclusion that the Crown asks me to find is not available then the Crown’s circumstantial case fails. But it is for me to determine what conclusion, if any, can reasonably be drawn from the established facts, and then consider whether there is any other reasonable explanation for those facts other than that of the accused’s guilt. If there is no other explanation consistent with all the established facts considered together, then it would be open to convict the accused.
	
	
	If, however, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the essential fact to which I have referred, I must return a verdict of not guilty. I should also find the accused not guilty if, looking at the established facts as a whole, I cannot conclude beyond reasonable doubt that he is guilty. As I have said, this would also be the position if, at the end of my deliberations, I am of the view that some other reasonable explanation exists for those facts other than that the accused is guilty.
	


ELEMENTS OF THE OFFENCE


	
	As stated earlier, in order to be able to establish the guilt of the accused, the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt, the following two elements of the offence:
	



	
	That on 8 December 2016 the accused possessed the firearm, namely, the .22 long rifle calibre/20 gauge Savage Arms model 24H-DL combination rifle/shotgun; and
	
	
	That the accused was not authorised to do so by a licence or permit.
	


EVIDENCE

Evidence not in dispute


	
	The accused’s father Mr Pasquale Bartuccio together with his wife has for some 40 years prior to 16 December 1996 resided at a large semi-rural property at 160 Devonshire Road Rossmore. They have six children between them although the evidence was that the last of his children moved out of home about ten years ago.
	
	
	The property consists of a one storey fibro home with four bedrooms, two kennels for dogs, a glass green house, a structure for pigs, a chicken coop and sheds used when the farm was operating for operating and packing. There was also a large shed.
	
	
	It is not in issue that on 8 December 2016 police went to the property at 160 Devonshire Road Rossmore and in a room in a shed depicted in a diagram marked in exhibits 1 and D located a firearm in a black coloured carry case being a Savage Arms Model 24 H-DL combination rifle/shotgun [7] .
	
	
	As to the second element, this was also not in dispute. A certificate issued under s 87 of the 1996 Act dated 13 October 2017 authored by Ms Julieanne Andrews – the Team Leader, Probity as the Delegate for the Commissioner of Police stated that:-
	


Vincenzo Bartuccio was not between 01/01/2000 and 21/05/2011 and 03/03/2004 and 08/12/2016, the holder of a Firearms Licence or Permit in New South Wales, which authorised the possession, or use of firearms.

Mr Bartuccio was the holder of a category AB firearms licence number 406055642. This licence was issued on 22/05/2012 and expired on 22/05/2014.

Mr Bartuccio’s licence was Suspended on 03/03/2014 and subsequently Revoked on 19/08/2014. [8] 


	
	Based on this document I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that on 8 December 2016 the accused was not authorised to hold a Firearms License or Permit in NSW. Accordingly, I am satisfied that the second element of the offence has been established.
	


What is possession?


	
	The essence of the concept of possession in law is that, at the relevant time, a person intentionally has control over the object in question, in this case, a firearm. A person may have this control alone or jointly with some other person or persons. A person must have the right to exclude other people from it. If these conditions are fulfilled, it may be said that the person has possession of that object, whether it is his own sole possession or whether it is a joint possession with somebody else.
	
	
	It is not necessary for a person to have something in their hand, pocket, wallet or purse before the law says that he has it in his possession. Further, a person does not need to own something in order to possess it. A person can possess something temporarily, or for some limited purpose. A person can possess something jointly with one or more other persons.
	
	
	In defining possession earlier, I used the phrase “intentionally have control”. This is to make clear that if something has been, for example, slipped into a custody unknown that person is not regarded as having possession of it in law, even though the case that the person is carrying could be said to be under their control.
	
	
	s 4 of the 1996 Act provides that the defines “possession”:
	


4 Definitions

‘possession’ of a firearm includes any case in which a person knowingly:

(a) has custody of the firearm, or

(b) has the firearm in the custody of another person, or

(c) has the firearm in or on any premises, place, vehicle, vessel or aircraft, whether or not belonging to or occupied by the person.

NB: See also section 4A.


	
	s 4A of the 1996 Act relevantly provides:-
	


4A Meaning of “possession” of a firearm – proof of possession

(1) Without restricting the meaning of the word “possession”, for the purposes of any proceedings under this Act, a firearm is taken to be in the possession of a person so long as it is in or on any premises owned, leased or occupied by, or in the care, control or management of, the person, unless the court is satisfied that:

(a) the firearm was placed in or on, or brought into or on to, the premises by or on behalf of a person who was lawfully authorised by or under this Act to possess the firearm, or

(b) the person did not know and could not reasonably be expected to have known that the firearm was in or on the premises, or

(c) on the evidence before it, the person was not in possession of the firearm.


	
	As the Crown is seeking to rely on the extended definition of the essential fact, the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the firearm was on 8 December 2016 on premises owned, leased or occupied by, or in the care, control or management of the accused.
	
	
	The Crown for its part asserted that the accused on 8 December 2016 occupied the premises at 160 Devonshire Road Rossmore and as a consequence of the firearm being found there the accused was in possession of the firearm in the absence of the Court being satisfied that the accused made out the grounds in ss 4A(1)(b) – (c) of the 1996 Act. The Crown conceded that there was no evidence of the accused owning or leasing the property and could not draw attention to any evidence of the accused having control or management of the premises.
	
	
	The word “occupied” is not defined in the 1996 Act.
	
	
	The evidence in this case was:
	



	
	That on 8 December 2016, Mr Pasquale Bartuccio took police when they were searching his home to a bedroom that he indicated was being used by his son, being the accused. He accepted that that was a room with a single bed along one wall. He later added that the room was his but occasionally people come to sleep there. In his statement (being Exhibit C), he stated that he had visitors and family members come to the house to visit randomly but they did not store any items in the bedroom. In cross-examination, Mr Pasquale Bartuccio accepted that when he told police officers that the room it was “Vincenzo’s room”, what he meant was that it was the room his son had when he was a child and living with him and his wife;
	
	
	Mr Pasquale Bartuccio also stated that (apart from the master bedroom and a room he uses to get dressed and ready) there were two other bedrooms are used by his children or grandchildren when they come to sleep there but also by him to go to sleep in the daytime;
	
	
	At the time of the search, Mr Pasquale Bartuccio accepted that there were some letters on the bed of one of the rooms addressed to the accused. There is no evidence of the nature of the letters and when they were received. Nevertheless, Mr Pasquale Bartuccio stated that he picked up the letter from the mailbox and placed them on the bed referred to earlier because they were the accused’s letters and sometimes children would be around and it was a way so that they would not get lost;
	
	
	Also in the room were some keys and a log book. They are photographed in Exhibit B, in photograph 6. The agreed facts in Exhibit A establish them as relating to a Holden utility vehicle in the yard. Ms Michelle Cassar was in a relationship with the accused from 2010 to about July 2015. She gave evidence that she was aware of the accused getting a silver Commodore utility that was stored on the accused’s parent’s property which she knew to be 160 Devonshire Road in Rossmore. Sometime after that she became aware of the accused getting a silver coloured Mercedes Benz which was stored at the same property. Ms Cassar’s evidence was that whilst she was in a relationship with the accused she knew him to live at his parent’s address;
	
	
	In the room where the keys and letters were found, police also found:
	



	
	Two ammunition belts with six shotgun rounds in the belt hanging on the wall of the room;
	
	
	A “Black Rhino” brand 4 x 32 optical scope;
	
	
	A gun cleaning kit;
	
	
	550 x Magnum .22 calibre rounds;
	
	
	34 x .22 calibre rifle rounds;
	
	
	36 x .22 calibre Long Rifle rounds; and
	
	
	2 x 12 gauge buckshot rounds.
	


There was no evidence as to how those items came to be there or when they were placed there. Mr Pasquale Bartuccio stated that the items did not belong to him;


	
	In the shed area, police located items described in paragraph 11 of Exhibit A, being:
	



	
	Framed pictures of animal;
	
	
	Tools;
	
	
	Super-X Xpediter .22 calibre Long Rifle cartridges in a bag;
	
	
	4 x .308 calibre rounds and 1 x .22 calibre round in a small bag on the pool table;
	
	
	4 x .308 calibre rounds and 1 x 12 gauge shotgun shell in a sunglasses cover; and
	
	
	A metal tin containing 41 x .22 calibre rounds.
	



	
	On a desk in the office area, the police found the following items:
	



	
	A bail reporting receipt for the accused dated 19 September 2016;
	
	
	A letter addressed to the accused at 160 Devonshire Road, Rossmore;
	
	
	A wooden box containing 6 x .22 calibre rounds; and
	
	
	Various quantities and types of other ammunition.
	



	
	The police also located in a kitchen cupboard in an area within the shed:
	



	
	Vehicle registration plates including registration plates AOF 37W, being the plate on the silver coloured Mercedes Benz the accused was driving when stopped by police on 26 May 2016 for the purposes of a random breath test.
	



	
	Mr Pasquale Bartuccio’s evidence was that none of the ammunition at the property belonged to him. He denied putting the bail slip, the vehicle registration plates or the letter addressed to the accused in the shed;
	
	
	Ms Cassar also knew the accused to work between five and six days a week being self employed as a bricklayer. Mr Pasquale Bartuccio gave evidence that the accused stored things in the shed on the property being a level, mixer, shovel, a row of pallets of bricks and “all work things”;
	
	
	In his statement to police on 16 December 2016, Mr Pasquale Bartuccio said that the shed on the premises where the firearm was located was only used by him and the accused. He said that the shed was open and he did not lock it because he did not want to fuss around with opening and shutting doors. However the door closed by itself and to open it he uses a five cent coin which he inserts into the door knob to unlock it. He referred to a rusty old car stored in the shed. He gave evidence that that the accused had told him the vehicle was given as a gift and was sprayed. In evidence however he stated that his son in laws used to paint cars in the shed as they worked as panel beaters. Mr Pasquale Bartuccio’s also stated that the shed was used by himself, the accused and occasionally his grandsons;
	
	
	Mr Bartuccio’s statement to police records that before 8 December 2016 there were three cars on the property which did not belong to him. He described them as being a blue utility, a Mercedes Benz and a Commodore. Later in his statement Mr Pasquale Bartuzzio describes the utility as being grey and in his evidence as possibly being silver;
	
	
	Mr Bartuccio stated that three or four months before December 2016 he saw a Mercedes parked in the front of his shed and two months before a Holden Commodore was parked near the front of the palm trees at the front of his property. In his statement he said that the utility was parked in front of the shed a few weeks after the Mercedes
	
	
	The accused’s wife, Mrs Evagelia Bartuccio, gave evidence that she married the accused on 4 January 1997 and they separated from January 2011 and December 2015. At the time of separation she knew the accused was living at 160 Devonshire Road, Rossmore. She stated that in late December 2015, after the accused was released from residential rehabilitation they were on good terms and starting to rekindle things. Her evidence was that in late 2015, the accused would stay over at her house at 12 Redpa Close, West Hoxton between 3 to 4 times a week and the balance of the week he was staying at 160 Devonshire Road, Rossmore. Thereafter, in July 2016, Mrs Bartuccio stated that the accused moved in with her and stayed fulltime at her address – a position that continued until the time of his arrest. She stated that at no time since July 2016 until the time of his arrest was the accused not living fulltime at her residence.
	


Were the premises occupied by the accused?


	
	The Defence says that the Crown has not established beyond reasonable doubt that the accused occupied the premises where the firearm was found. It therefore submits that s 4A(1) of the 1996 Act does not apply.
	
	
	The Defence refers to the Macquarie Dictionary definition of “occupy”. That Dictionary defines “occupy” as:
	


occupy 

- verb 

1. to take up (space, time, etc.).

2. to engage or employ (the mind, attention, etc., or the person).

3. to take possession of (a place), as by invasion.

4. to hold (a position, office, etc.).

5. to be resident or established in (a place) as its tenant; to tenant. [9] 


	
	Specifically, the Defence relies on the fifth use of the term arguing that the word must be given its ordinary meaning in the context in which it appears and that context includes the surrounding words of the provision. It argues that it is significant that it has been coupled with the term leased and implies a requirement of dominion. [10]  In this sense the Defence contends that it is insufficient to establish occupation beyond reasonable doubt that there were items that the accused stored on the premises.
	
	
	Further the Defence argues that the evidence does not establish that the accused occupied the premises on 8 December 2016 whether they be defined as the land in question or the shed where the firearm was found.
	
	
	It contends that the high water mark for the Crown case is the bail receipt however it was dated some six weeks earlier.
	
	
	The Crown asks me to find that that the accused “occupied” the premises where the firearm was located by the police from the personal items (including correspondence in the form of letters) discovered in the bedroom, that was identified by the accused’s father as being used by the accused [11] , the motor vehicles, the keys, and logbook, and in the shed, the accused’s work items, the bail slip and the registration plates for the vehicle that he was driving as he was stopped by NSW Police. Further it draws attention to the fact that the accused was according to Exhibit A, bailed to reside at the Rossmore address.
	
	
	Whist I accept that the term “occupied by” can also embrace a tenant or resident, the term in my view extends beyond such a boundary to include taking up space and to take up possession. In my view, the use of the words “occupied by” is to be given its ordinary meaning in its context as an extended definition. I do not accept that it is to be restricted by its positioning in the section. In my view, that term is used disjunctively. Whilst the Defence has drawn attention to the potential penal consequences the context of the term is such that those consequences do not arise where one of the exceptions is made out.
	
	
	In this case, I am satisfied that the accused did in fact occupy the subject premises as at 8 December 2016. Mr Pasquale Bartuccio’s gives evidence as to the circumstances of cars coming onto his property. Ms Cassar gives evidence of them belonging to the accused. There is evidence of the storage of work items belonging to the accused in the shed, the presence of mail belonging to the accused and number plates which included the plate of the vehicle which the accused was driving on 26 May 2016 being AOF 37W. A log book and keys of the silver Holden utility in the yard were located in the bedroom. There was also evidence as to the accused’s use of the shed. In all the evidence establishes the accused’s continuing occupation of the premises including through the storage of his work and other items including a bail receipt he was required to keep for twelve months. The number of items, their nature and timing of their presence along with the observations from the witnesses satisfies me beyond reasonable doubt that that the accused occupied the premises where the firearm was located on 8 December 2016 within the terms of s 4A of the 1996 Act.
	


Has the accused discharged the onus?


	
	The Defence argued that, should the Court find that s 4A (1) of the 1996 Act is enlivened then it had on the balance of probabilities discharged the onus under ss 4A(1)(b) or 4A(1)(c) of that Act in that, the accused did not know and could not reasonably be expected to have known that the firearm was on the premises or that the accused was not in possession of the firearm.
	


“Did not know and could not reasonably be expected to have known that the firearm was in or on the premises”


	
	In respect of s 4A(1)(b) of the 1996 Act, the Defence relies on the unchallenged evidence of Mr Pasquale Bartuccio in Exhibit C that:
	


[19] To the best of my knowledge, no one knew about the gun except my wife. I never used the gun in front of my children and I have no reason to suspect any of them knew about the gun or the ammunition. [12] 


	
	That evidence was preceded by a paragraph that read
	


[17] … Until the 8th of December 2016, the gun has always been, to my knowledge, at the property at the back of the shed. I stored the gun amongst my property, behind a door in between bits of iron and steel. It was kept inside a bag and unloaded. I suppose that anyone could easily access the gun by using a five cent coin to open the door and get it. However, if they are unaware of it, they would not be able to open it. Vincenzo did not have knowledge of the gun, and he’s never asked about it. Vincenzo knows how to get into the shed using the five cent coin … [13] 


	
	The requirement of s 4A(1)(b) of the 1996 Act is that the accused did not know and could not reasonably be expected to know that the firearm was in or on the premises. The accused’s reliance on Mr Pasquale Bartuccio’s knowledge does not discharge the onus placed on him. At its highest it tells us no more that the state of Mr Pasquale Bartuccio’s belief but even then, he acknowledges that the location of the firearm was such that anyone could easily access it. In May v R, McClellan CJ at CL stated:
	


[32] … This requires more than evidence from which a possible inference could be drawn. The accused must satisfy the trial court that he or she either did not know or could not be reasonably expected to know of the presence of the weapon (emphasis in original). [14] 


	
	Therefore, it follows that I do not find the accused has discharged the onus in s 4A(1)(b) of the 1996 Act.
	


“The person was not in possession of the firearm”


	
	In respect of s 4A(1)(c) of the 1996 Act, the Crown does not dispute that the relevant firearm was owned by the accused’s father – Mr Pasquale Bartuccio. In his statement to police Mr Pasquale Bartuccio stated that when the police executed the search warrant at 160 Devonshire Place, Rossmore on 8 December 2016 they showed a shotgun to him and he told police:
	


[16] … I told the police, “That is my gun, I’ve had it for forty years, and I had it on the property to kill feral animals.” [15] 


	
	Further Mr Bartuccio added;
	


[16] … “I had forgotten that I had the gun because I hadn’t used it for forty years.” The gun has two barrels, one up top (.22 Calibre) and one on the bottom (20 gauge shotgun). The handle is brown and the barrel is black. I have not used the gun for many, many years. [16] 


	
	The Crown argued that despite the ownership of the gun the accused should still be found in joint possession of it in light of the extended definition in s 4A of the 1996 Act, his access to the shed and the storage of personal items in the shed. It argued that the accused still exercised control over the firearm arising from his occupation of the shed.
	
	
	The Crown sought to rely on inferences which it says are available from items (which it described as “peripheral items”) [17]  located inside the house being ammunition and the gun cleaning kit as well as items located in the living quarters of the shed to the extent that their use may have been compatible with the firearm.
	
	
	The Crown further relied on the evidence of Ms Cassar who stated that during her relationship with the accused from 2010 to July 2015 she had seen a firearm in the shed and she recalled seeing it a couple of times. [18]  She could not recall when it was but stated the first time she recalled she was with the accused and her friend Kylie. [19]  She stated that it was a shotgun Because of it being that long and from the shooting game that I usually play, like, you have to, like, cock it back and load it … ” [20]  She added that what it actually was she did not know. [21]  She also thought she may have seen it on another occasion wrapped in a sheet up against the wall but she was not a hundred per cent certain. [22]  Later she said it was behind a chair in the shed at 160 Devonshire Road in the living area. [23]  She confirmed in cross-examination that the one occasion she saw the object she described the accused to her knowledge held a firearms licence. [24]  There was no evidence that the firearm the subject of the charge was ever registered in the accused’s name during the time he was licensed.
	
	
	The evidence further does not disclose when or how the firearm related items in particular those compatible with use of the firearm in question came to be located in the house or the shed.
	
	
	I accept Mrs Evagelia Bartuccio’s evidence that the accused had been residing fulltime with her at West Hoxton since July 2016. [25]  She was not challenged except to suggest that there were days where the accused stayed at his parents’ property in September 2016. She rejected this suggestion. [26] 
	
	
	The Crown conceded the locking device on the shed did not require a high degree of sophistication. It is clear that others, apart from the accused, used the area in the house and the shed where the firearm related items were located.
	
	
	The evidence of Ms Cassar does not establish that the firearm she recalls seeing was that found on the property on 8 December 2016. Her evidence was at times quite vague but in any event described seeing a gun with different features at a time the accused held a firearms license.
	
	
	The Defence argued that the evidence did not establish that the accused held, used or handled the firearm. The evidence of the Mr Pasquale Bartuccio was that had not told the accused about the gun. He had told his wife but not the accused. The location of the gun was where Mr Pasquale Bartuccio described it had “always been.” He said he stored the gun amongst his property behind the door in between bits of iron and steel. There is no suggestion that that was not consistent with the location police found it as depicted in Exhibit B in photograph 10 and Exhibit 1 and D. Nor was Mr Pasquale Bartuccio challenged as to his assertion of owning the gun for forty years.
	
	
	Exhibit A evidences that the firearm seized from the property was scientifically examined by NSW Government Forensic and Analytical Service, however the testing of the trigger and trigger guard was not suitable for comparison and other testing was unsuccessful.
	
	
	As at 8 December 2016 the accused was living at the property of his wife. Whilst I am satisfied that at times prior to that date the accused did access the shed in which the firearm was located, so did others despite any lock which may have been on the door. When I raised with the Crown the significance of this in assessing the level of satisfaction, I was advised that security was not a matter that I needed to consider except on the question of occupation. No submission was made as to the significance of security and access on the question of possession. Instead I was advised this was a matter the Defence might address on.
	
	
	The Defence for its part drew attention to comments of Simpson J (as her Honour then was) in Gardiner v R, where her Honour stated:
	


[138] Even if the evidence of the presence of the firearms in the clubhouse were capable of having probative value, the significance of that probative value had to be assessed in the light of the evidence of the comings and goings from the clubhouse of other members of the club. This must have weakened any inferences available as to the appellant’s possession of those firearms: see R v Filippetti (1978) 13 A Crim R 335. [27] 


	
	Those comments need to be considered in their context acknowledging that in the circumstances of this case the onus placed on the accused pursuant to s 4A(1)(c) of the 1996 Act. The Defence acknowledged that the accused had access to the shed area however it contended nonetheless that as possession [28]  was not exclusive the inferences are significantly weakened. Accepting that accused’s counsel intended to refer to occupation of the shed, I accept that this argument is correct.
	
	
	Based on the evidence as a whole in particular the unchallenged evidence of Mr Pasquale Bartuccio and largely unchallenged evidence of Mrs Evagelia Bartuccio I am satisfied that on the balance of probabilities that the accused did not intentionally have control of the firearm on 8 December 2016 such as to amount to possession at law either temporary or otherwise.
	


VERDICT


	
	The Defence having discharged the onus under s 4A(1)(c) of the 1996 Act, I find the offence not proved and the accused not guilty.

6267875,SafeWork NSW v Tolputt [2017] NSWDC 285,"Judgment

The charge and the plea


	
	Jeremi Scott Tolputt, the defendant, is charged with a breach of s 32 of the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (the Act) in that on 1 June 2015 at 73 Cape Three Points Road, Avoca Beach (the property), he failed to comply with a duty under s 28(b). The duty was owed to several persons, being Benjamin Martin, Jessie Powell, James Amson, Adam Hanscombe, Blake Currie and Michael Bell. The defendant has pleaded guilty.
	


The legislation


	
	Section 28(b) provides:
	


While at work, a worker must:

…

(b)   take reasonable care that his or her acts or omissions do not    adversely affect the health and safety of other persons …


	
	The defendant was a worker within the meaning of the section.
	
	
	Section 32 relevantly provides:
	


A person commits a Category 2 offence if:

(a)   the person has a health and safety duty, and

(b)   the person fails to comply with that duty, and

(c)   the failure exposes an individual to a risk of death or serious injury or illness.


	
	The maximum penalty applicable in this case is $150,000. I pause here to note that Mr Docking, who appeared for the prosecutor, drew my attention to the fact that s 32 provides for two categories where an offence is committed by an individual. One category provides for the maximum penalty of $150,000, the other provides for a maximum penalty of $300,000. He further drew my attention to different interpretations and whether truly the category of offence imposing the maximum penalty of $300,000 was appropriate. It tended to become something of an academic point in light of his instruction that this was a $150,000 case and not a $300,000 case. In any event, I have satisfied myself with the fact that it is a $150,000 case, by reason of the way the amended summons is pleaded. The $300,000 category requires that the offence be committed by an individual as a person conducting a business or undertaking or as an officer of a person conducting a business or undertaking. It may have been the fact that the defendant was carrying on a business or undertaking. If that was so, it was not pleaded as such. At least that is the way I read the amended summons.
	


The evidence


	
	The prosecutor tendered an agreed sentencing bundle of documents (Exhibit PX 1). Also tendered were extracts from records of interview that had been conducted with Mr Bradshaw, Mr Hanscombe and Mr Jessie Powell.
	
	
	The defendant relied on two affidavits of himself. One was sworn on 29 August 2017 and the other on 31 August 2017. The former related to his financial position. The latter put forward evidence in mitigation.
	
	
	The defendant also tendered an extract from a record of interview with Mr Martin. He also relied on what might be called character evidence. In that regard, there was a reference from Mr Gesling and there were affidavits from Julie Edwards, Benjamin Ward and Graeme Baker.
	
	
	The defendant was present throughout the proceedings and he gave evidence and was cross-examined.
	


Facts


	
	The parties provided an Agreed Statement of Facts which I summarise.
	
	
	The defendant, at all material times, was a self-employed tree-climbing contractor who performed tree and rope access work including for persons conducting a business or undertaking. He was a qualified Level 3 Arborist, and had been in the tree industry for a long time and was very skilled. He had before 1 June 2015 completed numerous jobs for Bradshaw Tree Services Pty Ltd (BTS). On 1 June 2015, he was contracted by BTS to remove a tree.
	
	
	In April 2015, the Central Coast was hit by a severe storm. The result was a tree fell onto a house on the property. The tree was a 17m bark tree. Most of its foliage and branches were directly overhanging the roofline. The property was a steep block, sloping away from the road. Access to the property was limited.
	
	
	BTS was contracted to inspect the fallen tree and remove it. Mr Bradshaw, the sole director of BTS, conducted his inspection on 27 May 2015 and completed a “BTS Safety Analysis”. He contemplated in that analysis “a process that the surrounding trees were to be used as lowering points to swing sections of the canopy that were over the roof and then lower them to the ground at the rear of the house. The process involved using an experienced climber with a team of labourers to drag branches and parts of the tree from the bottom of the back yard to the top of the property safely with the wood chipper to be used last”.
	
	
	Mr Bradshaw arranged for the following people to attend the property and remove the tree:
	



	
	The defendant was contracted as a specialist climber to access and dismantle the tree;
	
	
	Mr Jessie Powell (a BTS worker), to operate the chainsaws to cut felled section of the tree into smaller pieces for removal from the property;
	
	
	Mr Ashley Powell of IMS as Site Supervisor. IMS was a labour hire organisation;
	
	
	Mr Ashley Powell to provide five ground workers from IMS to drag branches and small sections from the rear of the property to the road. The labour hire workers included:
	



	
	Benjamin Martin;
	
	
	James Amson;
	
	
	Michael Bell;
	
	
	Adam Hanscombe; and
	
	
	Blake Currie.
	



	
	On 1 June 2015, Ashley Powell went to see Mr Bradshaw at 6:00am and picked up ropes integral to the work method outlined in the BTS Safety Analysis, and a harness and other equipment, to take to the property. The harness supplied was a tree harness, not a fall arrest harness which would have been necessary for roof work. The ropes were to assist in supporting the damaged tree during dismantling and the harness was to be used by a worker to access the roof to clean it of branches and debris following the tree removal. Mr Bradshaw also provided a copy of the BTS Safety Analysis to Ashley Powell.
	
	
	Ashley Powell headed towards the property, but following a telephone call, diverted to attend a school to resolve a public safety issue.
	
	
	Jessie Powell and the defendant arrived at the property. The defendant had spoken with Mr Bradshaw about the method to be used, but at the property he did not believe it would work. He did not contact Mr Bradshaw to speak to him about that. He did not wait for Mr Powell to arrive. Instead, the defendant decided that the only way to take down the tree would be to climb the roof to go up inside the tree, find the highest point and bring small pieces down on the roof. The pieces were then to be chopped up by the labourers in the backyard and dragged out by hand.
	
	
	Other workers arrived at the site. Jessie Powell spoke with Ashley Powell who informed him that he would be late. Ashley Powell had the BTS Safety Analysis with him and no other worker had seen it. Ashley Powell did not provide any direction that work not start until he arrived.
	
	
	Work commenced. The defendant was in the tree. Other workers assisted him with lowering parts of the tree. A saw was brought up to the roof. The defendant, Jessie Powell and all five labour hire workers were then on the roof.
	
	
	Ropes were used with a pulley system. A load would be tied around that rope then lowered using the rope and pulley. The load would swing slowly as it was lowered.
	
	
	When a branch was coming down, the defendant would stop cutting. Once lowered, Jessie Powell would cut the load into smaller pieces which were then thrown off the roof.
	
	
	At around 9:00am, the smaller branches had all been removed and thrown to the ground below.
	
	
	The defendant rigged the rope to cut a more substantial branch section that was to be lowered. When the cut was completed, the section of approximately one metre in length and 30 to 40 centimetres in diameter fell and swung at an angle out towards the edge of the roof. The defendant told the workers that this load was going to swing and they needed to move as they were in the flight path of the cut section and that this load could knock them all off the roof. They all moved out of the way where they believed it was going to swing.
	
	
	Whilst the section was being lowered using the rope, Mr Amson did not expect it to swing as hard as it did and the section hit Mr Amson’s left shoulder. The section then swung across to hit Mr Martin who walked from behind Mr Amson and towards the swinging section. The force of the strike knocked Mr Martin off balance. He stumbled and rolled towards the edge of the roof. Mr Amson brought down the section as quickly as possible, jumped towards Mr Martin and was able to grab Mr Martin’s ankle. Mr Martin went over the edge and Mr Amson could not continue to hold him. Mr Martin grabbed the gutter at the roof edge which came off the roof fascia. Mr Martin fell approximately 11 metres to the ground below. He fell directly into the mass of loose foliage and small branches that had collected to a depth of 1.5 metres on the ground thus cushioning his fall.
	
	
	As a result of the incident, Mr Martin sustained a fractured shoulder and required physiotherapy. He also suffered from minor flashbacks and had difficulty sleeping.
	
	
	Had the defendant contacted Mr Bradshaw when he formed a view that the job could not be done as planned, or had he waited for Mr Ashley Powell to arrive, the job would not have been done in the manner it was.
	


The risk


	
	There was a risk to the workers of death or serious injury from:
	



	
	being hit by parts of the fallen tree that were being felled, dropped or lowered from their position during the removal of the tree;
	
	
	falling approximately 11 metres from the roof to the ground below at the property.
	


Codes of practice


	
	There were codes of practice in place at the time of the incident. They included:
	



	
	the “Code of Practice for the Amenity Tree Industry” of August 1998 (the Tree Code); and
	
	
	the “Managing the Risk of Falls at Workplace Code of Practice” of January 2012 (the Falls Code).
	



	
	The Tree Code notes that tree work is hazardous and that each year many people are killed or injured in the tree industry.
	
	
	The Falls Code dealt with falls in a workplace generally. There was a risk of fall within the meaning of the Code.
	
	
	The work being undertaken at the property was a high risk storm damage job.
	
	
	The defendant failed to take reasonable care that his acts or omissions did not adversely affect the health and safety of other persons in contravention of s28(b) of the Act. One particular is expressed as: failing to “after inspecting the site not commencing and undertaking tree felling, dropping or lowering work that required workers to be on the roof”. That is acknowledged to be somewhat inelegantly worded. The intent is clear enough. It is that the defendant’s work method required workers to be on the roof after he had inspected the site.
	
	
	The defendant was the most experienced and competent person at the property. He should have refused to do the job after inspecting the tree and the surrounding trees. He has acknowledged as much in his affidavit.
	
	
	Further particulars are also somewhat inelegantly expressed. They may be, however, defined as follows.
	


(b)   Mr Tolputt undertook the task without:


	
	consulting Mr Bradshaw as to an alternative to the plan they had earlier discussed;
	
	
	ensuring that no more than two workers were on the roof;
	
	
	ensuring that anyone on the roof used travel restraint equipment to prevent free fall.
	



	
	The Falls Code provides that persons other than a person conducting a business or undertaking may also have a responsibility for health and safety. The same message is set out in another code being the Work Health and Safety Consultation, Co-operation and Co-ordination Code of Practice of New South Wales of December 2011 (the Safety Consultation Code). The Safety Consultation Code provides, in effect, for cooperation and coordination between duty holders responsible for the same task.
	
	
	I note at this point that Mr Bradshaw and the defendant had coordinated and cooperated, but the defendant departed from the plan that had been set by Mr Bradshaw and agreed to by the defendant and did so without coordination and cooperation with Mr Bradshaw.
	
	
	The Falls Code requires that workers exposed to risk of fall should be adequately supervised, have received training and instruction in relation to the work and use fall control measures.
	
	
	At the time, WorkCover had a publication as to “Vulnerable Workers”. Basically, they are those who are young or lacking in experience. Messrs Martin, Hanscombe, Currie and Jessie Powell were clearly vulnerable workers. They were all young. Though 34 years old, Mr Amsom may also be classified as a vulnerable worker.
	
	
	The job should not have started without the workers having travel restraint systems.
	
	
	Safe systems for minimising risks of falls were available. Such systems are provided for in The Falls Code, the SafeWork Code and the National Code of Practice for the Prevention of Falls in Housing Construction of SafeWork Australia of April 2010.
	
	
	Approximately one week after the incident, the defendant and Ashley Powell attended the site to complete the removal of the tree. One worker assisted the defendant on the roof. The defendant and the worker on the roof wore harnesses. Two ropes were tied off the front of the house and the top of the roof with secure anchor points to harness the workers in case they fell. Branches were lowered either directly onto the ground or onto the roof and then the ground. The defendant provided this extra safety equipment for the worker because it was not provided by BTS. On this occasion, the defendant provided this extra equipment to guard against any recurring incident.
	


The sentencing process


	
	I bear in mind several matters. I bear in mind the purposes of sentencing as enumerated in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I bear in mind the purposes of the work health and safety legislation, in particular ensuring the safety, health and welfare of workers and others on workplace premises. I bear in mind any relevant aggravating and mitigating factors, including any mentioned in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act so far as any of those may be relevant.
	
	
	I start my analysis with a consideration of the gravity of the offence. This may be determined in part by the foreseeability of the risk of injury, the foreseeability of the consequences of the risk coming home and the measures available to avoid the risk.
	
	
	Foreseeability in this case was plain and needs no explanation. This is at two levels. First, risk of injury from swinging timber and from fall from roof were clearly foreseeable. Secondly, the potential consequences of those risks coming home were clearly foreseeable and that included potential fatal injury.
	
	
	Measures were readily available to eliminate the risk in this case.
	
	
	Paragraph 5 of the Amended Summons sets out the measures the prosecutor relies on in this case. The defendant accepts that the measures relied on by the prosecutor were readily available and I have already referred to them. In short, they are not proceeding with the task after inspecting the site, consulting with Mr Bradshaw about an alternative method, ensuring the use of travel restraint systems. Further, there was the measure adopted to undertake the task after the incident and already referred to.
	
	
	General deterrence needs to be considered and allowed for in the penalty. The Court of Appeal has stressed the importance of this in Bulga Underground Operations v Nash [2016] NSWCCA 37. Those operating in the industry must understand that safety is paramount and failure to comply with safety requirements will have consequences. As the Tree Code notes, tree work is hazardous and many people in the industry are killed or injured each year.
	
	
	Specific deterrence must also be factored in. The defendant does not do tree work of the kind he was doing at the time of this incident. He still, however, operates in a risky industry with considerable work at heights. I accept the defendant’s evidence and that of others that he is a very safety conscious person and more so since in the incident.
	
	
	There are aggravating factors that may be taken into account. There are two matters. One is the injuries to Mr Martin may be described as substantial – Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 21A(2)(g). The other is the offence included a grave risk of death – s 21A(2)(ib).
	
	
	There is a number of factors to be taken into account on behalf of the defendant. He has no prior conviction related to health and safety matters. That has to be seen in the context of operating in the industry for a long time.
	
	
	The offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity.
	
	
	The affidavits that I have mentioned attest to the defendant being a person of good character. I pause to note that on many occasions he has volunteered his time and work in the cause and assistance of others. I accept his evidence as to the effect this incident has had upon him and his ready recognition from the outset that the task should not have been undertaken the way it was.
	
	
	I am satisfied that he is unlikely to reoffend and that he has good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	There is some evidence that is somewhat confusing, particularly as to his attempts to contact Mr Bradshaw or anybody from Mr Bradshaw’s business before undertaking the task. I am satisfied, however, that he has accepted responsibility for his actions and has done so more or less from the outset.
	
	
	He has pleaded guilty and is entitled to consideration for that. The benefit of a plea of guilty lies essentially in its utilitarian value and, accordingly, normally, the earlier the plea, the greater the value. The plea of guilty was entered practically immediately upon the settling of the amended summons. It was fairly evident from his first interview that this was likely to be a plea. I think in the circumstances, he is entitled to the full benefit of an early plea.
	
	
	The prosecutor has acknowledged frankly that there has been considerable assistance from the defendant and from his lawyers in the course of the investigations and the prosecution of these proceedings.
	
	
	The defendant led financial evidence seeking to call in aid s 6 of Fines Act 1996. The prosecutor frankly acknowledges that the evidence is sufficient for the discharge of the defendant’s onus in this regard. I bear in mind the defendant’s state of indebtedness, his limited resources, his uncertainty of work, his ongoing business financial commitments, his family situation of non-working wife and five children with another due shortly and also his liability for the costs of these proceedings which the prosecutor estimates could be about $24,000.
	
	
	All these mitigating matters lead to a result that will be less of a fine than would otherwise be imposed in the circumstances. In all the circumstances, including the allowance for the discount for the plea of guilty, I think the appropriate penalty is the sum of $20,000.
	


ORDERS


	
	The defendant is convicted and fined the sum of $20,000 with a moiety to the prosecutor.
	
	
	The defendant is to pay the prosecutor’s costs as may be agreed or assessed.

6267973,Davis v R [2017] NSWCCA 257,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Price J and the orders which he proposes.
	
	
	PRICE J: On 21 September 2015, Annette Lisa Davis (“the applicant”) was found guilty by a jury of having supplied the prohibited drug methylamphetamine at Caringbah on 2 June 2011. This is an offence contrary to ss 25(1) and 29 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW).
	
	
	The Crown case at trial was that the applicant had supplied the methylamphetamine by being in sole possession of 25.64 grams of the prohibited drug, which was found by police in the bedroom that she occupied at a house in Cook Street, Caringbah (“the premises”) on 2 June 2011.
	
	
	The applicant’s case was that she was not a drug supplier. It was put to the jury that the possessor of the drugs was likely to be Martin Hogan, with whom she had a sexual relationship and had been staying with her for a couple of days prior to 2 June 2011. Alternatively, the drugs may have been in the possession of Lauren Ironside who left the premises about one month before the execution of the search warrant. Ms Ironside had previously occupied the same bedroom as the applicant occupied when the methylamphetamine was located.
	


The grounds of appeal


	
	The applicant appeals against the conviction on the following grounds:
	


“Ground 1: A miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the admission of evidence that the applicant was a drug-user and funded her drug habit by committing credit card fraud.

Ground 2: There was a miscarriage of justice occasioned by the failure to treat evidence that Hogan and Ironside had supplied drugs as tendency evidence.”

The evidence at trial


	
	As the focus of the appeal is confined to these issues, it is unnecessary to detail all of the evidence in the trial. A convenient summary of the relevant evidence is as follows.
	
	
	When the search warrant was executed, Paul Doyle (one of the lessees of the premises), Eric Gannon (the other lessee), Andrew Pedretti (a visitor), Mr Hogan, and the applicant were present. Mr Gannon occupied bedroom one, Mr Doyle bedroom two, and the applicant bedroom three.
	
	
	Police found 1.38 grams of methylamphetamine in Mr Doyle’s bedroom and a set of silver electronic scales in the entertainment unit in the lounge room. The premises was in a mess and a number of “fit boxes” for syringes were located by police.
	
	
	At the time police entered bedroom three, Mr Hogan and the applicant were present. Mr Hogan was searched. Located in his rear left pocket was $1,110 in various denominations of Australian currency, and within the folded bank notes was a small resealable plastic bag containing 0.8 grams of methylamphetamine.
	
	
	During a search of bedroom three, the police found:
	



	
	13.4 grams of methylamphetamine with a purity of 79 per cent inside a portable air-conditioning unit;
	
	
	a set of scales and 3.9 grams of cannabis leaf;
	
	
	a number of plastic bags containing a total of 12.24 grams of methylamphetamine, 6 grams of which had a purity of 81.5 per cent, inside a blue and white zip-up bag that was behind a bamboo screen; and
	
	
	another set of scales and a bag containing small resealable plastic bags inside the wooden drawer of a bedside table.
	



	
	The applicant was arrested by Detective Senior Constable Robert Wahhab. Detective Wahhab gave evidence that the applicant indicated that she was renting bedroom three for $100 a week, nobody else was staying with her, and she was unable to say how long she had been there. In cross- examination Detective Wahhab agreed that when he arrived at the premises, the applicant was sick and was taken to the hospital by ambulance. He confirmed that no money was found on her at the time of her arrest.
	
	
	The applicant declined to participate in an electronically recorded interview.
	
	
	Detective Senior Constable Daniel Phillis gave evidence of the criminal histories of the occupants of the premises as follows:
	



	
	the applicant had no criminal record for drug possession or supply;
	
	
	Mr Hogan had been convicted of offences of possess prohibited drug on 5 July 2000, 17 November 2000; 4 February 2005; 9 May 2005; and 26 July 2012. In addition, Mr Hogan was convicted of the supply of 14.6 grams of cocaine on 19 May 2008 with the supply of 1.4 grams of methylamphetamine taken into account on a Form 1;
	
	
	Ms Ironside had been convicted of the supply of a prohibited drug in circumstances where she was found with 32 grams of methylamphetamine in 27 small resealable plastic bags on 9 July 2008. Seven of those bags were found in the jacket she was wearing, however she denied that the jacket belonged to her. She was also convicted for offences on 26 September 2008, when 14 grams of methylamphetamine were on her person and 18.9 grams of methylamphetamine were in a safe at her home; and
	
	
	Mr Doyle had been convicted of one count of possess a prohibited drug on 17 August 1995 and of two counts of possess a prohibited drug on 2 November 2006.
	



	
	Detective Sergeant Nicholas Glover was called by the Crown to give expert evidence. The opinions he expressed included that the quantity and purity of the methylamphetamine found in bedroom three had a value of $12,000 which was at the top end of the range. In cross-examination, Detective Glover agreed that it was likely that drug dealers would not carry a huge amount of drugs with them, but rather would have a stash ready to supply. He noted drugs are typically hidden where it is most difficult for others to find them. He also agreed that if drugs are close in purity, it might indicate that they are from the same source. Detective Glover gave evidence that the term “perso” generally refers to personal use.
	


The intercepted telephone call


	
	The Crown played an intercepted telephone call between the applicant and Mr Hogan that took place on 6 December 2011, while the applicant was in custody. The conversation included the following:
	


“Applicant: I just had a legal visit.

Hogan: …

Applicant: They’re getting me for 28 gram[s].

Hogan: Yeah?

Applicant: Yeah, not 14.

Hogan: So, this, they’re, so 28 they’re tryin’ to say?

Applicant: Yeah.

Hogan: Well um… ahhh just squeezing a pimple. Fuckin’ hell.

Applicant: Fuckin’ hell’s right ah.

Hogan: What are they tryin’ to say, what are they tryin’, which… - - -

Applicant: 14, 14 - - -

Hogan: - - - … - - -

Applicant: - - - 14 in that, in the fuckin’ air-conditioning unit - - -

Hogan: Yeah.

Applicant: - - - and 14 in a makeup bag sitting on a shelf.

Hogan: There was more but you know what I mean?

Applicant: What?”


	
	The conversation also included:
	


“Hogan: So, 20, 28 grams, eh?

Applicant: Yeah.

Hogan: That’s fuckin’ shithouse.

Applicant: Yeah, but 14 of ‘em they were in the air-conditioning unit, he reckons that I won’t get done for ‘cause it’s common area - - -

Hogan: Yeah, yeah.

Applicant: - - - the other 14 I can go for perso.

Hogan: Yeah, fair enough. All in one bag.

Applicant: Yeah.

Hogan: - - - no more to the story.”

Ms Ironside’s evidence


	
	Ms Ironside gave evidence that she resided in bedroom three of the premises prior to 2 June 2011. She had been released from custody in October 2010 and entered into custody again on 18 May 2011 after being picked up on a warrant. Mr Hogan was her partner in early 2011.
	
	
	Ms Ironside stated that she moved out of the premises about a week prior to going to gaol in 2011; later in her evidence-in-chief she stated that she had moved out about a month prior. She could not recall how long she had lived at the premises, but said it was “not too long”. When she moved out, she left only a bed and a clothes rack in bedroom three, as these were there prior to her moving in. She said that she was “100 per cent certain” that she took all of her belongings with her and moved them to her Auntie’s house.
	
	
	During cross-examination, Ms Ironside’s evidence was that she had completely moved out before the applicant moved into bedroom three and there was no cross-over period. She said that the applicant was aware that she was leaving.
	
	
	Ms Ironside testified that she “wouldn’t leave [drugs] behind” (Tcpt, 16 September 2015, p 75) and any drugs that police found did not belong to her. She denied that she owned a blue and white zip-up bag and a set of scales. She also denied that an air conditioner was in the bedroom and that she put up a bamboo screen. Further, she denied knowledge of the drugs in the air conditioning unit and in the blue and white zip-up bag. She said that after she moved out, she was picked up on the warrant and went to gaol.
	
	
	Ms Ironside agreed that she used a lot of drugs at the time and that she has served time in prison for the supply of drugs. She denied that between October 2010 and May 2011 she had contacts from whom she could source large amounts of drugs. She agreed that Mr Hogan had supplied her with drugs in the past.
	


Mr Hogan’s evidence


	
	Mr Hogan gave evidence that the drugs found in the applicant’s bedroom did not belong to him and that he had no knowledge of those drugs.
	
	
	At the commencement of the applicant’s trial counsel’s (“applicant’s counsel”) cross-examination, Mr Hogan was asked the following questions (Tcpt, 17 September 2015, pp 104–105):
	


“Q. Mr Hogan, you have known [the applicant] for some time?

A. Yes.

Q. During that time you have never known her to deal drugs, have you?

A. No.

Q. Pardon?

A. No, I haven’t.

Q. You would know because you know that she is a person who has used drugs?

A. Yes.

Q. And that her method of sourcing drugs was by committing credit card fraud, wasn’t it?

A. Yes.

Q. She would go to shops and obtain items through the use of credit card fraud around that time, and she would give those items to her dealers?

A. Yes.”


	
	In further cross-examination he stated that he had never known the applicant to deal drugs or to smoke marijuana. He said that he did not think that the drugs belonged to the applicant and that he knew both Mr Doyle and Ms Ironside to be suppliers of drugs. Mr Hogan admitted that he himself was a drug supplier. He agreed that he had possessed scales previously and had seen both Ms Ironside and Mr Doyle in the possession of scales. Mr Hogan said that he had never seen the applicant with a set of scales.
	
	
	Mr Hogan said that when the applicant moved in she brought a bag of clothes and an Xbox. He said that she did not bring any furniture because there was already a bed and drawers in the room. The applicant moved in a few days or a week prior to 2 June 2011. Mr Hogan was in a sexual relationship with her and had been staying with her for a few days. On the night of 1 June 2011, he observed Mr Doyle go into the applicant’s bedroom a couple of times and he also saw Mr Pedretti go into the room.
	
	
	When asked whether he was aware of the drugs in bedroom three, Mr Hogan replied, “I was aware of it as anyone else so what?” (Tcpt, 17 September 2015, p 112). He was asked whether the drugs in the air conditioner were his and he said, “they could have been, yeah” (Tcpt, 17 September 2015, p 112). He was asked about the drugs in the blue and white zip-up bag behind the bamboo screen and he said “they all could have been mine, yes” (Tcpt, 17 September 2015, p 112) Mr Hogan agreed that it was difficult for him to remember what drugs he had at various times.
	
	
	Mr Hogan was asked whether he agreed that the drugs were his and he replied, “yes, whatever you want, whatever you want me to agree to I’ll agree to it, this is just ridiculous, went on four fucking years” (Tcpt, 17 September 2015, p 113). He also agreed that it was possible that the cash that was found on him on the night could have been obtained from supplying drugs from the blue and white zip-up bag. When questioned as to whether he had previously said in court that he put drugs in the air conditioner, Mr Hogan replied “yeah, well I probably did to get it over and done with” and then “[l]ook, I don’t, I don’t, I don’t know any of this, I don’t believe they’re hers I don’t know whose stuff it is, I don’t know if it’s mine whatever, look I don’t know” (Tcpt, 17 September 2015, p 116). He said that he was no longer in a relationship with the applicant and denied lying to protect her.
	
	
	Mr Hogan gave evidence that the applicant had given him items of clothing, jewellery, and electronic goods to pay for her drugs. On one occasion, she had given him a fridge.
	
	
	The Crown made a successful application for leave to question Mr Hogan pursuant to s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). He agreed that in a signed statement he stated that he did not know anything about the drugs located in the bedroom. When asked to explain the inconsistency between his evidence and the statement, his evidence included (Tcpt, 17 September 2015, p 122):
	


“… they kept asking me, so last time I turned around and said, yeah, yeah, I know about them, they’re all mine…I don’t know what youse want… to hear from me, I don’t know anything about them, it’s as easy as that.”


	
	In further questioning of Mr Hogan by the Crown, the following appears (Tcpt, 17 September 2015, p 128):
	


”Q. And it’s the case is it that the payment that [the applicant] would give would include by way of items that were the subject of her fraudulent activities, do you agree with that?

A. Yes.

Q. And one such item was a refrigerator—

[Applicant’s Counsel]: I object to this line of questioning. In my submission the Crown is just simply splitting his case – has split his case. He had the opportunity to ask all these questions in the earlier part of his – in-chief, he didn’t.

HER HONOUR: Well those questions do though arise out of cross-examination.

[Applicant’s Counsel]: Sorry, your Honour.

HER HONOUR: They arise out of cross-examination. You elicited this evidence in cross-examination.

[Applicant’s Counsel]: Well - -

HER HONOUR: You did. You opened the door [applicant’s counsel].

[Applicant’s Counsel]: Yes, your Honour.”


	
	After the applicant’s counsel’s objection was overruled, Mr Hogan was taken to a document and questioned as follows (Tcpt, 17 September 2015, p 129–130):
	


“Q. You see about halfway down the page it starts about here, showing you halfway down?

A. Yeah, talking about the fridge, yeah.

Q. You see the reference to [the applicant] going to Bing Lee with the stolen credit card and purchasing a fridge valued at $2,415?

A. Yes.

Q. You received that fridge shortly after 15 May 2011 didn’t you?

A. Yes.

Q. That was in exchange for you providing her with drugs wasn’t it?

A. Yes.

Q. There was also, if you look at the top of the page, there was a transaction involving a laptop to the value of $1,222 wasn’t there?

A. Yes.

Q. And [the applicant] obtained that with a fraudulent credit card or a credit card that wasn’t hers, is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. And she provided you with that laptop, didn’t she?

A. I’m not sure, I can’t remember.

Q. These are the facts to which you were convicted weren’t they?

A. I’m not sure.

Q. It doesn’t ring any bell that?

A. I can’t remember, I said it was years ago. I remember the fridge, I just can’t remember the laptop and that. I don’t think I ever got convicted of any laptop. I think it was just the fridge.

Q. And there was a further laptop wasn’t there in the next under offence 3, there’s a further laptop there--

A. Yeah.

Q. - - to the value of $839 that arose out of transactions as well as 15 May 2011 wasn’t there, a Toshiba laptop?

A. Yeah.

Q. And you received the benefit, you received that laptop as well didn’t you?

A. What’s that?

Q. You got that laptop as well didn’t you?

A. I’m not sure.”


	
	Mr Hogan agreed after the intercepted telephone call was played, that he knew of the existence and quantity of the drugs in the bedroom when the police raided it.
	


Mr Pedretti’s evidence


	
	Mr Pedretti denied that any of the drugs located at the premises belonged to him.
	
	
	In cross-examination he said that he had never known the applicant to supply methylamphetamine or smoke marijuana and that he had only known her to have small quantities of methylamphetamine for personal use.
	
	
	On the night of 1 June 2011, he bought “a couple of hundred dollars’ worth” of methylamphetamine from Mr Hogan and used the drug at the premises alone. He had previously purchased drugs from Mr Hogan.
	
	
	Under cross-examination by the Crown, Mr Pedretti agreed that in court on the previous occasion he said that he had not purchased drugs from Mr Hogan on that night. Mr Pedretti confirmed that he did purchase the drugs and explained that previously he did not want to tell on Mr Hogan.
	


Mr Doyle’s evidence


	
	Mr Doyle gave evidence that he and Mr Gannon held the lease for the premises in 2011. Mr Doyle denied that the drugs located in bedroom three belonged to him. He said that the applicant resided in bedroom three on 2 June 2011, and that Ms Ironside had lived in bedroom three prior to this. He stated that when Ms Ironside left, she took all of her belongings except her bed and some drawers or a rack. He confirmed that Ms Ironside and the applicant were not living in the room at the same time, and there was a little gap in time between their occupancies. After Ms Ironside moved out, Mr Doyle tidied up the room and did not find any drugs.
	
	
	Mr Doyle stated that he found the air conditioning unit on the side of the road, took it apart to fix it up, and then put it into bedroom three. He did not see any drugs inside it.
	
	
	In cross-examination, Mr Doyle said that there was not much left in the room when Ms Ironside left. He thought the bamboo screen may have been put up by Ms Ironside. He agreed that he never knew the applicant to supply drugs, and that neither Mr Hogan nor the applicant supplied him with drugs on the night of 1 June 2011.
	


The applicant’s evidence


	
	During the applicant’s evidence-in-chief, she stated that by 2 June 2011 she had been residing at the premises for roughly two to three weeks. It was her understanding that she would be staying at the premises with Ms Ironside, however, as soon as she moved in, Ms Ironside said that she was going out and never came back.
	
	
	The applicant testified that when she moved in she brought a couple of bags of clothes and her Xbox. Furniture was already in the room, including bedside tables and the air conditioning unit.
	
	
	The applicant denied that the drugs found in the air conditioner and the drugs located behind the bamboo screen were hers. The applicant said that she never saw either of the two parcels of drugs and she only came to know about them after her arrest. She denied that the scales located in the bedroom were hers but said that there were always scales around the premises. She said that she did not smoke marijuana and denied that the marijuana in the room was hers.
	
	
	Her evidence was that she had been using “ice” since about 2004 and had become addicted. She said that in May or June 2011 she was using “maybe one to two points a day” (Tcpt, 17 September 2015, p 170) and that the most methylamphetamine she would have had on her at a time was half a gram, worth about $250.
	
	
	The applicant had known Mr Hogan since 2004 as a “dealer” and he supplied her with methylamphetamine over that period of time. She stated that she and Mr Hogan had been in a sexual relationship for about a month before she moved into the premises. The applicant also knew Ms Ironside as her “dealer”, with whom she had been best friends for a little while. She denied selling drugs for Mr Hogan. She said that she obtained her drugs from Mr Hogan and paid for them by exchanging items, which she purchased through the use of credit card fraud. She said that she would buy all different kinds of things, such as phones, clothes, a fridge and whatever Mr Hogan asked for. In exchange for the fridge purchased on 15 May 2011, Mr Hogan gave her three or five points of methylamphetamine and another couple of points upon delivery.
	
	
	The applicant agreed that she was using methylamphetamine at the time of her arrest but said that on the night of 1 June 2011 she did not take any drugs. During the search and arrest, she thought that she was miscarrying and was taken to hospital.
	
	
	The applicant explained that in the intercepted telephone call conversation, she was recounting the advice that she had obtained from Legal Aid. She explained that she was indicating that if the 14 grams were classified as drugs for personal use she would not be sentenced as heavily as if it were a supply charge.
	
	
	In cross-examination, the applicant denied that Ms Ironside had moved out before she moved in, but she agreed that the sexual relationship with Mr Hogan had started about a week prior to her moving in.
	
	
	The applicant gave evidence that the two parcels of drugs that were found in her bedroom were worth way more than the fridge. She denied that she put drugs from the fridge transaction in the blue and white zip-up bag. She denied giving Mr Hogan the $1100 cash that was found in his possession in addition to the fridge for the drugs.
	
	
	The applicant said that she may have had between half a gram and one gram of methylamphetamine on her person at any particular time, but never more than that. She conceded that on the last occasion before the court she said that the most she would have had was one gram. Mr Hogan last supplied her two days before the search on 2 June 2011. She could not recall how much he supplied, but said it would not have been more than one point. She denied having drugs in her possession for personal use on 2 June 2011.
	
	
	The applicant agreed that she supported her drug habit by credit card fraud. She accepted that she sold some of the items obtained by fraud to buy drugs. In further cross-examination, the applicant said that she would obtain a credit card number, not knowing whose card it was, put the number into a machine at the shops, and purchase goods with it.
	


Ground 1: A miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the admission of evidence that the applicant was a drug-user and funded her drug habit by committing credit card fraud

Argument


	
	It was submitted that the decision of the applicant’s counsel to adduce evidence that she was a drug-user who supported her habit by committing offences of credit card fraud led to a miscarriage of justice. The contention was that this issue became a major focus in the trial. The Crown’s lengthy cross-examination included questions about the applicant’s prior convictions for dishonesty and the suggestion that she was a dishonest person generally.
	
	
	The applicant argued that the introduction of this evidence could not be explained on the basis of a forensic advantage. The evidence that the applicant was a drug-user was said to be inadmissible tendency evidence and the evidence of funding her drug habit by committing credit card fraud was credibility or bad character evidence.
	
	
	A further submission was that the Crown’s cross-examination on the applicant’s dishonesty required the leave of the court pursuant to s 104(2) of the Evidence Act and leave was not sought.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the course taken by the applicant’s counsel was a considered one. The Crown pointed to the evidence of the search of the premises, which revealed a number of “fit boxes” for syringes and contended that it would have been difficult, if not impossible, to leave the jury with an impression that the applicant was not a drug-user, but came, unfortunately, to live in a “drug house”. The Crown said that it was important to the applicant’s case to show that all of the others in the premises were drug addicts and that some were suppliers, in order to shift the blame for the drugs found in her room.
	
	
	The evidence of being an “ice user” was not, the Crown argued, “inadmissible tendency evidence” and the evidence of the applicant’s credit card fraud was not bad character or credibility evidence given the way the applicant’s case was presented.
	
	
	As to the applicant’s argument that the court’s leave was required under s 104 of the Evidence Act, the Crown submitted that the cross-examination was not relevant only to the assessment of the applicant’s credibility but went to the issue raised by the applicant’s counsel.
	
	
	Further reference was made by the Crown to the judge’s directions to the jury. The Crown’s submission was that no miscarriage of justice has been established.
	


Consideration


	
	The applicant’s contention is that the manner in which her counsel conducted the trial resulted in a miscarriage of justice. The applicant’s complaint is directed at the decision of her counsel to adduce evidence that she was a drug-user whose habit was supported by credit card fraud. The topic was first introduced at the outset of the cross-examination of Mr Hogan at [23] above.
	
	
	In order to establish a miscarriage of justice, the applicant must do more than “simply point to some failing, even a gross failing, of the legal representative who appeared…”: John Wayne Tsiakas v R [2015] NSWCCA 187 at [44]; Younan v R [2016] NSWCCA 248 at [96]. The applicant must demonstrate that there is a significant possibility that the acts of which she complains affected the outcome of the trial: TKWJ v The Queen (2002) 212 CLR 124; [2002] HCA 46 (“TKWJ”); Nudd v The Queen [2006] HCA 9; (2006) 80 ALJR 614.
	
	
	Where the course taken by the applicant’s counsel is the result of an informed and deliberate decision which could have resulted in a forensic advantage to the applicant, the applicant will not establish a miscarriage of justice unless, “the advantage is slight in comparison with the disadvantage resulting from the course in question”: TKWJ at [33] (Gaudron J); see also [84]–[85] (McHugh J).
	
	
	I do not agree with the applicant’s submission that the introduction of the evidence could not be explained on the basis of a forensic advantage. The choice made by the applicant’s counsel had the advantage of explaining to the jury that the applicant’s drug addiction was funded by her dishonest use of other people’s credit cards and not by the sale of prohibited drugs. The evidence before the jury included the methylamphetamine secreted in her bedroom, the “fit boxes” for syringes in the premises, and the intercepted telephone call during which the applicant said “…the other 14 I can go for perso”. Whilst it is often difficult to predict the outcome of a jury trial, in these circumstances, an attempt by the applicant to put herself before the jury as anything other than a drug-user would, in all likelihood, have been unsuccessful. Her evidence that she was not a drug supplier, but a personal user, was supported by Mr Hogan, Mr Pedretti, and Mr Doyle, all of whom had been called by the Crown.
	
	
	The evidence of the applicant’s drug use and credit card fraud was not, as the applicant argues, inadmissible tendency evidence or bad character evidence. Rather it was evidence that could rationally affect the assessment of the existence of the critical issue at trial which was whether the applicant was the possessor of the methylamphetamine hidden in the air-conditioning unit and blue and white zip-up bag behind the bamboo screen.
	
	
	Experienced counsel may have differing views as to the suitability of putting the evidence before the jury, however, the decision of the applicant’s counsel is understandable. I am not persuaded that the course taken by the applicant’s counsel, resulted in a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	Another issue, however, arises from the Crown’s cross-examination of the applicant. The applicant contends that some of the questions asked by the Crown were solely relevant to her credibility and should not have been asked without the court’s leave. The definition of “credibility evidence” is found in s 101A of the Evidence Act:
	


“101A Credibility evidence

Credibility evidence, in relation to a witness or other person, is evidence relevant to the credibility of the witness or person that:

(a) is relevant only because it affects the assessment of the credibility of the witness or person, or

(b) is relevant:

(i) because it affects the assessment of the credibility of the witness or person, and

(ii) for some other purpose for which it is not admissible, or cannot be used, because of a provision of Parts 3.2 to 3.6.”


	
	Section 104 of the Evidence Act relevantly provides:
	


“104 Further protections: cross-examination as to credibility

(1) This section applies only to credibility evidence in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to section 103.

(2) A defendant must not be cross-examined about a matter that is relevant to the assessment of the defendant’s credibility, unless the court gives leave.

(3) Despite subsection (2), leave is not required for cross-examination by the prosecutor about whether the defendant:

(a) is biased or has a motive to be untruthful, or

(b) is, or was, unable to be aware of or recall matters to which his or her evidence relates, or

(c) has made a prior inconsistent statement.

(4) Leave must not be given for cross-examination by the prosecutor under subsection (2) unless evidence adduced by the defendant has been admitted that:

(a) tends to prove that a witness called by the prosecutor has a tendency to be untruthful, and

(b) is relevant solely or mainly to the witness’s credibility.

(5) A reference in subsection (4) to evidence does not include a reference to evidence of conduct in relation to:

(a) the events in relation to which the defendant is being prosecuted, or

(b) the investigation of the offence for which the defendant is being prosecuted.

…”


	
	The Crown cross-examined the applicant at length concerning her drug use and credit card fraud. This evidence was relevant to the critical issue in the trial (see [62] above) and was not relevant only to the applicant’s credibility. The Crown’s cross-examination on these topics did not require the court’s leave under s 104(2) of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	The focus of the applicant’s complaint, however, were the following questions asked by the Crown (Tcpt, 17 September 2015, p 174):
	


“Q. And there’s no question, is there, that you became dishonest, there’s no question about that, is there, after 2004?

A. Desperate.

Q. Well, in fact dishonest?

A. Yeah, it was after, actually after 2009 I believe, after I lost my father and both my kids that’s when I started doing my, yeah, that’s when my habit got really bad to numb my pain and that’s when I started doing fraud to pay for it.

Q. But in any event then even from 2009 you accept that you became a dishonest person?

A. After 2009, yes.

Q. And you became dishonest to get money for your ice habit, didn’t you, yes?

A. Yes and I wasn’t proud.”


	
	Later on, the Crown questioned the applicant as follows (Tcpt, 17 September 2015, p 179):
	


“Q. Well you were in fact convicted, weren’t you, of using and holding a fake licence in 2010?

A. Not a – I don’t know if it was a fake licence.

Q. Do you accept that you were convicted in 2010 of using a fake licence?

A. I don’t remember that, no.

Q. You don’t remember that?

A. No. Not a fake licence.

Q. Do you accept that you were convicted of having equipment to make false documents in 2010?

A. I believe that they found like a nail file kind of thing in my – and sticky tape, or something – yeah, and a Stanley knife it was, as well.”


	
	In oral argument in this Court, Senior Counsel for the Crown did not accept that this evidence was solely relevant to the applicant’s credibility but conceded that “it might have gone just a little bit further” (Tcpt, 17 July 2017, p 5).
	
	
	The difficulty in deciding whether particular evidence is relevant only to credibility is well-recognised. In Nicholls v The Queen (2005) 219 CLR 196; [2005] HCA 1, McHugh J said at [43]:
	


“[43]… It is also often difficult to maintain the distinction between evidence that affects only the credit of a witness and evidence that is relevant to a fact in issue. The credibility of a witness is inevitably indirectly relevant to establishing facts in issue. Sometimes, the credibility of a witness is decisive of the facts in issue. It is a matter of degree, both in relation to relevance and to whether a fact is collateral. Whether a fact bears on the credit of a witness depends not only upon what the witness represents to the court, but also upon the nature of the party’s case.”


	
	In my view, questions about the applicant’s dishonesty after 2004, the use of a fake license and the possession of equipment to make false documents had no relevance whatsoever to the critical issue in the trial which was the possession of the prohibited drugs. Nor could it be said that the evidence could either directly or indirectly rationally affect the assessment of any other fact in issue. The relevance of the evidence was confined to the assessment of the applicant’s credibility.
	
	
	The Crown did not argue that the credibility rule did not apply as the evidence “could substantially affect the assessment of the credibility of the witness”: s 103(1) of the Evidence Act. The Crown’s submission was that the evidence was of “minor moment” in the case.
	
	
	There was also some debate as to whether the applicant’s counsel objected to the questions being asked by the Crown. In the passage quoted at [30] above, an objection was raised by the applicant’s counsel to a line of questioning by the Crown of Mr Hogan concerning the applicant’s fraudulent use of the credit card and the purchase of the fridge on the basis that the Crown was “splitting his case”. No further objection was taken.
	
	
	In any event, the evidence was not admissible unless the court gave leave: s 104(2) of the Evidence Act. The Crown was obliged to seek leave from the judge before asking these questions but did not do so. Furthermore, if leave had been sought, the conditions required by s 104(4) for the grant of leave would not have been met. No evidence had been adduced by the applicant that tended to prove that a Crown witness had a tendency to be untruthful and was relevant solely or mainly to the witnesses’ credibility.
	
	
	Before considering further what impact the inadmissible evidence had upon the trial, the judge’s directions to the jury concerning the applicant’s drug use and dishonesty should not be overlooked. Her Honour gave the following instructions to the jury (SU 23–24):
	


“… Now you may come to the conclusion, it wouldn’t be too hard, that she was involved in some criminal activity, including drug use and dishonesty. You will have to consider how this affects your assessment of the truth of her evidence. You must keep in mind however that she does not have to prove anything. However you should be careful not to assume that because she was involved in some form of criminal activity, including using drugs, that she is therefore guilty of the charged offence.

The Crown must prove the charged offence against her on the evidence that is before her. So the fact that she has been involved in criminal offences might affect your assessment of her credibility, but remember she does not have to prove anything. There is a danger that I have to warn you about, and it is a normal human failing I would think, members of the jury, that you would use the fact that she has been involved in criminal activity to set off in your mind a form of reasoning a bit like this. You might think that the evidence that she has been involved in criminal activity means that she was a person of bad character. Crimes are more often committed by people of bad character. Therefore the accused is more likely to be guilty of this crime with which she is charged.

Now a jury is never permitted to use such evidence for the purpose of concluding that the accused is guilty of a crime with which she is currently charged simply because she has been guilty of other offences or might be the sort of person who might commit a crime. It is a prohibited line of reasoning and my firm direction to you is that you must not allow it to enter into your deliberations. The evidence is not led before you for that purpose. It is led really to put context to the circumstances of the house at this time and to give some real sense to the circumstances in which these drugs were found.

It is not put before you so you can reason or that you can use it in that impermissible way. If you do think she is a person of bad character, that is a conclusion that you may or may not draw, it is entirely up to you. But if you do draw that conclusion you cannot draw a conclusion that therefore she must be guilty of this offence charged. You must look at all the other things that I have told you about to consider whether the Crown has proven its case to the required standard or not. But of course you can take that evidence into account in general when considering whether you accept her evidence or not, keeping in mind that the onus remains on the Crown and never on the accused.”

The Proviso


	
	The Crown contended that if this Court determined that the applicant’s ground of appeal was established, the Court should apply the proviso under s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) as no substantial miscarriage of justice occurred.
	
	
	The present issue relates to the third limb of s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act to which the proviso may operate namely where “on any other grounds whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice”. This Court is to decide whether a “substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred”: Weiss v The Queen (2005) 224 CLR 300; [2005] HCA 81.
	
	
	In Filippou v The Queen (2015) 256 CLR 47; [2015] HCA 29, French CJ, Bell, Keane and Nettle JJ said at [15]:
	


“[15] That leaves the proviso, which in terms is applicable to all three limbs of s 6(1). It directs that, even where error of the kind identified in any of the three limbs is established and amounts to a miscarriage of justice, the Court of Criminal Appeal may dismiss the appeal if it is satisfied that the error has not been productive of a substantial miscarriage of justice. By ‘substantial miscarriage of justice’ what is meant is that the possibility cannot be excluded beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant has been denied a chance of acquittal which was fairly open to him or her or that there was some other departure from a trial according to law that warrants that description.

…

Where the third limb is engaged, if the Court of Criminal Appeal has concluded that the appellant has not received a fair trial it will follow that it has concluded that there has been a substantial miscarriage of justice. But where, despite some other identified irregularity, the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the appellant has received a fair trial according to law and not otherwise been deprived of a chance of acquittal that was fairly open to him or her, once again the proviso will operate. It is also to be borne in mind, as was explained in Baiada and more recently noticed in Lindsay v R, that, although the proviso is expressed in permissive terms, ‘if the condition (the conclusion that no substantial injustice has actually occurred) is satisfied’ the proviso must be applied.”


	
	In my opinion, the Crown’s argument that the inadmissible evidence was of little moment in the trial should be accepted. The members of the jury had heard a great deal of evidence about the applicant’s dishonest use of other people’s credit cards before she was asked about being dishonest after 2004 and the other offences. These questions would have had little impact upon the jury. Furthermore, the judge directed the jury of the prohibited line of reasoning arising from other offences.
	
	
	Whilst I do not agree with the Crown’s submission that the evidence in the trial overwhelmingly established the applicant’s guilt, it was a fairly strong Crown case. The strength of the case coming in particular from the combined force of the applicant’s occupation of bedroom three where the drugs were located, the evidence of Ms Ironside as to when she moved out of the bedroom taking all of her belongings with her, Mr Doyle’s testimony of the gap in time between the occupancies and the items left in the bedroom after Ms Ironside moved out, and the intercepted telephone call. It is hardly surprising that the jury rejected Mr Hogan’s inconsistent accounts that the drugs were his. Also, it is clear that the jury did not accept the applicant’s evidence. They were not obliged to do so.
	
	
	I am satisfied that neither the course taken by the applicant’s counsel nor the inadmissible evidence deprived the applicant of a chance of acquittal that was fairly open to her. No substantial injustice has been established arising from these matters and I would apply the proviso.
	


Ground 2: There was a miscarriage of justice occasioned by the failure to treat evidence that Hogan and Ironside had supplied drugs as tendency evidence

Argument


	
	The applicant submitted that the evidence establishing that both Mr Hogan and Ms Ironside had possessed and supplied prohibited drugs, including methylamphetamine in the past was tendency evidence. The basis for this submission was that this evidence was relevant to a fact in issue, namely, whether Mr Hogan or Ms Ironside possessed the drugs found in the applicant’s bedroom because it was said to show that both persons had a tendency to act in a particular way, that is, to possess prohibited drugs for the purposes of supply and to in-fact supply those prohibited drugs. The applicant acknowledged that a tendency notice was not served, but said that the evidence was admitted without objection from the Crown.
	
	
	The applicant contended that the jury should have been directed that they could use this evidence to conclude that Mr Hogan and Ms Ironside had a tendency to possess drugs for the purposes of supply and in determining whether either was in possession of the drugs found in the applicant’s bedroom. The applicant accepted that no such direction was sought at trial.
	
	
	The applicant was critical of the Crown’s request to the judge for an “anti-tendency” direction and the direction made by her Honour, which was said to be the opposite of what the jury should have been told.
	
	
	A further argument was that the members of the jury were not told in any meaningful way how they could use the evidence and whilst the significance of the evidence was probably obvious to the jury, her Honour’s direction had the effect of neutralising the force of the evidence. The applicant’s counsel’s failure at trial to have the evidence admitted as tendency evidence and to seek a direction was not explicable on the basis of a forensic advantage. The applicant submitted that the judge’s direction deprived her of a chance of acquittal that was fairly open.
	
	
	The Crown did not accept that, if the judge had been requested, a direction would necessarily have been made that Ms Ironside had a tendency to possess methylamphetamine for supply on the basis of one conviction for an offence which occurred three years earlier. The Crown, however, conceded that the case may have been different with respect to Mr Hogan, as he had previously supplied methylamphetamine on numerous occasions.
	
	
	The Crown argued that the jury accepted that the totality of the evidence established that the reason that two sets of methylamphetamine were found carefully hidden in the applicant’s bedroom was that she had possession of them. The Crown argued that absence of directions in terms submitted by the applicant did not cause her to suffer a miscarriage of justice.
	


Consideration


	
	After the completion of addresses and in the absence of the jury, the Crown asked the judge for an “anti-tendency direction” (Tcpt, 18 September 2015, p 246):
	


“CROWN PROSECUTOR: I don’t know what your Honour is proposing to say. I imagine your Honour would cover it in any event, particularly having regard to my learned friend’s eloquent submissions to the jury, anti-character as such, first time supply possibility, anti-tendency clearly in relation to - -

HER HONOUR: An anti-character and anti-tendency direction I think is tied up in one direction and there’s a standard anti-character, anti-tendency direction. It doesn’t quite fit with the circumstances of this case but that’s the direction that I would propose to give. 

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Thank you, your Honour. I figured your Honour may have that. The concern in relation to tendency is clearly levelled at Hogan and Ironside, the fact of prior conviction was clearly amounting to tendency. In my submission it would be important to indicate that, one can’t use facts - -

HER HONOUR: It was almost part of [the applicant’s counsel’s] submission to the jury, wasn’t it?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: That’s the concern and the fact of a prior conviction dose not lead to a conclusion that the person - -

HER HONOUR: Well, the issue in relation to Ironside, Hogan and whoever else is running around the house or whoever else had conviction but I think it’s Ironside and Hogan that are the people who had convictions of supply. The Crown have to rule out as being a reasonable possibility that they were the possessors of the drugs and that’s certainly true. What I would certainly add to that in light of [the applicant’s counsel’s] submissions to the jury that they cannot assume just because they’ve been convicted of supply once they have a tendency to supply on more than one occasion. I don’t know how that’s going to fly with the jury in light of Mr Hogan’s evidence but anyway - -” [Emphasis added.]


	
	The applicant’s counsel did not take issue with what was said by the judge.
	
	
	In the course of the judge’s directions, the jury was instructed as follows (SU 18–19):
	


“So, if after having considered all of the evidence as a whole you accept the version given by [the applicant] which, in general was, ‘didn’t know anything about it, it wasn’t mine, first time I saw it was then’, if you accept that version then of course you must find her not guilty. If, however, after having considered all of the evidence the version suggested to you by [the applicant’s counsel] on behalf of [the applicant], and having considered all of the other evidence in the trial, you do not positively accept the version or possibilities outlined by [the applicant’s counsel] but, nevertheless, you are left with some doubt as to the issue of possession then again you must find her not guilty as it would follow that the Crown has not proven their case beyond reasonable doubt.

It is only if you reject the evidence of the accused completely and reject the possibility that the drugs were actually the drugs belonging to either Ms Ironside or Mr Hogan, or somebody else who left them there. Only if you reject those scenarios as a possibility then you can find the accused guilty but of course you must also be satisfied of all of the other elements of the offence.”


	
	Later on in the summing-up, her Honour said (SU 21):
	


“Now when you are considering the evidence of Mr Hogan and Ms Ironside, and the evidence of previous convictions for drug supply. That evidence was put before you and it was fairly put before you. You must not however consider that just because they have convictions for drug supply on a prior occasion then of course the drugs must have been theirs for the purpose of supply on this occasion. When assessing their evidence you should not assume that just because they have been drug suppliers in the past then they have some kind of tendency that you can take into account when assessing their evidence on this occasion.

In any event, I would say to you you’re not being asked to make a finding whether the drugs were Mr Hogan’s or Ms Ironside’s or [the applicant’s]. You are not being given… a choice. You are being asked only whether the Crown have proven beyond reasonable doubt that they were [the applicant’s]. Do you understand the difference? I guess you do.” [Emphasis added.]


	
	The applicant’s counsel neither complained to the judge about these directions nor did she ask for a tendency direction.
	
	
	There appears to have been no discussion prior to the Crown’s application to the judge for an “anti-tendency” direction on the basis upon which the evidence of the prior convictions for drug supply of Mr Hogan and Ms Ironside had been admitted. The applicant did not give notice under s 97 of the Evidence Act of the intention to adduce the evidence nor did the Crown object to its admissibility.
	
	
	Section 97(1) of the Evidence Act, so far as is relevant to the circumstances of the trial, applies where:
	


“… evidence of the… conduct of a person [is tendered] to prove that a person… had a tendency to act in a particularly way”.


	
	Evidence of conduct, however, may be relevant to a fact in issue “independently of its tendency to show that a person had a propensity to act in a particular way”: Jacara Pty Ltd v Perpetual Trustees WA Ltd (2000) 106 FCR 51; [2000] FCA 1886 at [67]. What then is the relevance of the prior convictions of persons other than the applicant in the context of the issues in the trial?
	
	
	The applicant told the jury that she had no knowledge of the drugs found by police in the air-conditioner and in the blue and white zip-up bag. It was vital to her case that there was at least a reasonable possibility that another person had possession of the drugs. On this question, the evidence of the prior convictions of Mr Hogan and of further drug supply by him, viewed in combination with his occupation of bedroom three has substantial probative value. Similarly, but to a lesser extent given the gap between the occupancies of Ms Ironside and the applicant, Ms Ironside’s prior convictions have probative value.
	
	
	In my view, the probative value of the evidence is not as tendency evidence but as evidence directly relevant to the critical issue in the trial which was whether the Crown had established beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was in possession of the drugs.
	
	
	I do not agree with the applicant’s submission that a tendency direction was required.
	
	
	The difficulty in this case arises from the Crown’s request for an “anti-tendency” direction which her Honour acceded to.
	
	
	In this Court, Senior Counsel for the Crown said that “it was a slightly odd direction to have given” (Tcpt, 17 July 2017, p 7) and conceded that the direction “probably shouldn’t have been given” (Tcpt, 17 July 2017, p 6).
	
	
	What is referred to as an “anti-tendency” direction is sometimes given by a court when the reception of tendency evidence relied upon by the Crown may occasion prejudice to an accused and the direction may reduce that prejudicial effect. That was not the present case, as the onus was on the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was in possession of the drugs and the evidence was relevant to that issue.
	
	
	It appears that by the direction, her Honour was endeavouring to ameliorate any prejudicial effect to the Crown by the jury reasoning that because of their prior convictions, Mr Hogan or Ms Ironside must have been in possession of the drugs. Included in what was said by her Honour to the jury in the passage quoted at [91] above was the following (SU 21):
	


“When assessing [Mr Hogan’s and Ms Ironside’s] evidence you should not assume that just because they have been drug suppliers in the past then they have some kind of tendency that you can take into account when assessing their evidence on this occasion.”


	
	This direction was confusing and had the potential to divert the jury’s attention away from the relevance of the evidence. The members of the jury may have understood that they could not take into account the prior convictions of Mr Hogan and Ms Ironside when assessing their evidence. The direction diminished the significance of the prior convictions to the applicant’s case and did not provide appropriate guidance to the jury as to the use to be made of the evidence.
	
	
	In my respectful opinion, the jury should have been told by the judge that the evidence of the prior convictions, of further drug supply and of the occupation of bedroom three by Mr Hogan and Ms Ironside was relevant to their task of assessing whether it was a reasonable possibility that someone other than the applicant had the possession of the drugs.
	
	
	As the applicant’s counsel did not object to the direction, r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW) applies.
	
	
	Although the applicant’s counsel did not ask for a re-direction, I am satisfied that by the misdirection, the applicant has lost a chance fairly open to her of being acquitted. As I have explained, the evidence of the prior convictions of Mr Hogan and Ms Ironside and of further drug supply was vital to her case. There was no forensic advantage to be gained by the applicant’s counsel’s failure to raise the issue. I am satisfied that a miscarriage of justice has occurred.
	
	
	I do not think that a new trial should be ordered. The applicant was sentenced by the judge to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 10 months, expiring on 17 July 2016 with a balance of term of one year expiring on 17 July 2017. She was released to parole on 17 July 2016 and the whole of her sentence has been served. Furthermore, a new trial would be the third trial that the applicant would stand for the alleged offence. Although serious, a third trial would be disproportionate to the importance of the offence. Another factor is that it is over six years since the offence was said to have been committed.
	
	
	Accordingly, I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Appeal upheld.
	
	
	The applicant’s conviction is quashed.
	



	
	SCHMIDT J:   I agree with Price J.

6267981,Livbuild Pty Ltd v Willoughby City Council [2017] NSWCCA 255,"EX TEMPORE Judgment


	
	WARD CJ in Eq: I will ask Beech-Jones J to deliver his judgment.
	
	
	BEECH-JONES J: Pursuant to s 5AB of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, the appellant, Livbuild Pty Ltd (“Livbuild”), appeals against its conviction in the Land and Environment Court for two offences under s 125(1) of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (the “EPAA”) of carrying on “development” on land that an environmental planning instrument specified could not be carried out without consent in the absence of such a consent, contrary to s 76A(1) of the EPAA. Livbuild required an extension of time to file its notice of appeal under s 10(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act. An extension has already been granted by a Registrar of this Court.
	
	
	Even though Livbuild pleaded guilty to the two offences, it contends that its convictions should be set aside on the basis that the prosecution of the offences was commenced out of time. The prosecutor, the Willoughby City Council (the “Council”), accepts that the prosecutions were commenced out of time and the convictions should be set aside. For the reasons that follow I consider that concession was correctly made.
	


Background


	
	On 19 September 2014 the Council filed two summonses in the Land and Environment Court charging Livbuild with the offences the subject of the appeal. On 21 November 2014 Livbuild entered pleas of guilty to both charges. The sentence proceedings took place on 16 February 2015. On 9 March 2015 Pepper J published reasons and imposed sentence (Willoughy City Council v Livbuild Pty Ltd [2015] NSWLEC 34). Her Honour convicted Livbuild of the two offences, fined it $48,000 for one offence and $19,000 for the other, and ordered it to pay the Council’s costs of the proceedings.
	
	
	The agreed facts placed before Pepper J stated that Livbuild was a building contractor and that in 2009 it was engaged to perform work on a property in Northbridge by its owner. This building work, which included the unauthorised work, commenced “[i]n about March 2010”. The agreed facts record that Livbuild stopped work on the property on 29 March 2012. On this appeal an agreed fact was tendered which restated that Livbuild stopped work at that time. The agreed facts tendered before Pepper J also recorded that on 27 February 2013 Steven Balafas “an officer of the Council, inspected the property and observed that works had been carried out in the rear yard of the property, adjacent and below the pool and spa terrace and adjacent to the foreshore”. Pepper J made findings in accordance with those facts.
	
	
	From the time the proceedings were commenced until they concluded at first instance, s 127 of the EPAA relevantly provided:
	


“127   Proceedings for offences

(1)   Proceedings for an offence against this Act may be taken before the Local Court or before the Court in its summary jurisdiction.

…

(4)   If proceedings in respect of an offence against this Act are brought in the Court in its summary jurisdiction, the Court may impose a penalty not exceeding the maximum penalty provided by this Act in respect of the offence.

(5)   Proceedings for an offence against this Act or the regulations may be commenced not later than 2 years after the offence was alleged to be committed.

(5A)   However proceedings for any offence may also be commenced within, but not later than, 2 years after the date on which evidence of the alleged offence first came to the attention of an authorised officer within the meaning of Division 2C of Part 6.

(5B)   If subsection (5A) is relied on for the purpose of commencing proceedings for an offence, the information or application must contain particulars of the date on which evidence of the offence first came to the attention of an authorised officer and need not contain particulars of the date on which the offence was committed. The date on which the evidence first came to the attention of an authorised officer is the date specified in the information or application, unless the contrary is established.

(5C)   This section applies despite anything in the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 or any other Act.” (emphasis added)


	
	During that period, Division 2C of Part 6 included s 122I(1) of the EPAA which provided that the “Director General may appoint any person (including a class of persons) as an authorised officer for the purposes of this Division”. (Division 2C of Part 6 was repealed and subsection 127(5A) was amended with effect from 31 July 2015 by the Environmental Planning and Assessment Amendment Act 2014: schedule 2[7] and 2[8]. The amended version of s 127(5A) has no relevance to these proceedings.)
	
	
	Given that it was agreed that Livbuild ceased undertaking work on the property in March 2012 it followed that the proceedings against it were not commenced within the two year period provided for in ss 127(5). However, the proceedings had been commenced within two years of Mr Balafas’ inspection in February 2013 and thus former s 127(5A) might have been satisfied if he was “an authorised officer within the meaning of Division 2C of Part 6” of the EPAA.
	
	
	On 10 December 2015 Craig J published reasons for rejecting a plea of guilty proffered by the owner of the property and acquitted him on similar charges to those filed against Livbuild: Willoughby City Council v Screnci [2015] NSWLEC 192. His Honour found that the charges had been commenced out of time with the consequence that the summons should be dismissed and acquittals entered (at [58]). In so far as the Council had sought to rely on Mr Balafas’ inspection in February 2013 and former s 127(5A), Craig J recorded the following (at [22]):
	


“Both the original and the amended summons filed in each proceeding had, in purported compliance with s 127(5B), stated the date upon which evidence of the offence had first come to the attention of Mr Balafas. The statement had also asserted that Mr Balafas was an “authorised officer”. However, it is now acknowledged by the prosecutor that while Mr Balafas was authorised to perform certain functions of the prosecutor, he was not “an authorised officer within the meaning of Division 2C of Part 6”, with the consequence that the provisions of subs (5A) were not engaged. The time within which proceedings were required to be commenced for the charges brought against Mr Screnci was therefore governed by the provisions of subs (5).” (emphasis added)


	
	Craig J then determined that the Council had not proved that the proceedings were brought within the two year period referred to in s 127(5) (at [42]).
	
	
	An affidavit sworn by Livbuild’s solicitor on 1 August 2017 and read on this appeal states that Livbuild became aware of Craig J’s judgment in December 2016. Between December 2016 and June 2017, the solicitor corresponded with the Council and then its solicitors in relation to Mr Balafas’ status as an officer under Division 2C of Part 6 of the EPAA. In June 2017 the Council’s solicitors confirmed the Council’s concession that Mr Balafas was not an authorised officer under former Division 2C of Part 6 of the EPAA at the relevant time. This concession was repeated in a statement of agreed facts tendered on this appeal.
	


The Appeal


	
	The submissions of both parties cite a number of authorities for the proposition that, notwithstanding a plea of guilty, a conviction that results from a prosecution brought in breach of a statutory time period will be liable to set aside on appeal including R v Cooling [1990] 1 Qd R 376; R v Tait [1996] 1 VR 662; [1995] VSC 154 (“Tait”)
	
	
	In Tait Callaway JA, with whom Winneke P and Crockett AJA agreed, explained that an appellate Court would set aside a conviction in such circumstances on the basis that it involved a miscarriage of justice. His Honour held that a plea of guilty that was entered to a prosecution commenced in breach of a statutory bar as to time would be liable to be set aside because it fell it within the category of cases where “upon the admitted facts [the appellant] could not in law have been convicted of the offence charged (at 665 citing R v Forde [1923] 2 KB 400). In such a case “if the applicant could not lawfully be prosecuted … he could not lawfully be convicted”. This approach was entirely consistent with the analysis of Dawson J in Meissner v The Queen (1994-1995) 184 CLR 132; [1995] HCA 41 at 157 concerning the circumstances in which a conviction based on a plea of guilty will be set aside.
	
	
	The proposition that a conviction based on a plea of guilty to a charge that was filed in breach of a statutory bar as to time should be set aside in an appeal under s 5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act was treated as obvious in Faehringer v R [2017] NSWCCA 248 at [40] to [42] per Wilson J (with whom Macfarlan JA and I agreed). There is no reason not to adopt the same approach with an appeal under ss 5AA and 5AB of the Criminal Appeal Act. This position can be contrasted with a collateral challenge to a prosecution on the basis that the proceedings were commenced out of time. Depending on the form of statutory bar, a conviction that results from such a prosecution will usually not be affected by a jurisdictional error (Parisienne Basket Shoes Proprietary Ltd & Ors v Whyte (1938) 59 CLR 369; [1938] HCA 7; Adams v Chas S Watson Pty Ltd (1938) 60 CLR 545; [1938] HCA 37 at 553)).
	
	
	Accordingly, I propose the following orders:
	



	
	The orders made by the Land and Environment Court on 9 March 2015 in proceedings number 50764 and 50767 of 2014 be set aside and, in lieu thereof:

6267988,SafeWork NSW v Freyssinet Australia Pty Ltd [2017] NSWDC 290,"JUDGMENT

The incident


	
	On 10 February 2015 at a worksite at 19-33 Kent Road, Mascot (the site), Mr Oketi Felemi and fellow workers were walking down a stairway (the stairway). The landings of the stairway had timber handrails. When descending the steps close to a landing, Mr Felemi lost his footing. He fell vertically more than three metres from the open side edge of the landing on the stairway onto the bottom landing. Mr Felemi landed on his head and suffered serious brain and other injuries.
	


The charge and the plea


	
	Freyssinet Australia Pty Ltd (Freyssinet) is charged with an offence under s 32 of the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (the Act). It is alleged that on 10 February 2015 Freyssinet was a person conducting a business or undertaking within the meaning of s 19 and that it had a health and safety duty under that section. It is further alleged that the duty was to ensure, so far as was reasonably practicable, the health and safety of workers while the workers were at work in the business or undertaking. It is further alleged that it failed to comply with that duty and that the failure exposed Mr Felemi to a risk of death or serious injury.
	
	
	Freyssinet has pleaded not guilty.
	


The legislation


	
	Section 32 of the Act provides:
	


A person commits a Category 2 offence if:

(a)   the person has a health and safety duty, and

(b)   the person fails to comply with that duty, and

(c)   the failure exposes an individual to a risk of death or serious injury or illness.


	
	Section 19 relevantly provides:
	


(1)   A person conducting a business or undertaking must ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health and safety of:

(a)   workers engaged, or caused to be engaged by the person, and

(b)   workers whose activities in carrying out work are influenced or directed by the person,

while the workers are at work in the business or undertaking.

(2)   ...

(3)   Without limiting subsections (1) and (2), a person conducting a business or undertaking must ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable:

(a)   the provision and maintenance of a work environment without risks to health and safety, and

(b)   the provision and maintenance of safe plant and structures, and

(c)   the provision and maintenance of safe systems of work, and

(d)   the safe use, handling, and storage of plant, structures and substances, and

(e)   the provision of adequate facilities for the welfare at work of workers in carrying out work for the business or undertaking, including ensuring access to those facilities, and

(f)   the provision of any information, training, instruction or supervision that is necessary to protect all persons from risks to their health and safety arising from work carried out as part of the conduct of the business or undertaking, and

(g)   that the health of workers and the conditions at the workplace are monitored for the purpose of preventing illness or injury of workers arising from the conduct of the business or undertaking.

(4)   …

(5)   …


	
	Section 18 provides:
	


In this Act, reasonably practicable, in relation to a duty to ensure health and safety, means that which is, or was at a particular time, reasonably able to be done in relation to ensuring health and safety, taking into account and weighing up all relevant matters including:

(a)   the likelihood of the hazard or the risk concerned occurring, and

(b)   the degree of harm that might result from the hazard or the risk, and

(c)   what the person concerned knows, or ought reasonably to know, about:

(i)  the hazard or the risk, and

(ii)  ways of eliminating or minimising the risk, and

(d)   the availability and suitability of ways to eliminate or minimise the risk, and

(e)   after assessing the extent of the risk and the available ways of eliminating or minimising the risk, the cost associated with available ways of eliminating or minimising the risk, including whether the cost is grossly disproportionate to the risk.

The risk


	
	The risk pleaded was the risk of workers suffering death or serious injury by falling through the unprotected gap between the edge of the stairway and the handrail.
	


The evidence as to the incident


	
	To understand the evidence in its context, it is useful to start by dealing with the evidence as to the incident and the circumstances surrounding that.
	
	
	The stairway was inside a high rise residential tower development under construction. The stairway was inside one of four towers to be constructed on the site. Two of the towers were being constructed at the time of the incident.
	
	
	The stairway was an internal stairway running from the ground level to a basement where there were workers’ lockers, lunch room, toilets and offices. There were two other accesses to that basement [1] , but signs erected by Karimbla Construction Services (NSW) Pty Ltd (Karimbla) directed all workers to use the one where the incident occurred. Karimbla was the head contractor/builder on the site. It was often referred to as Meriton.
	
	
	The stairway comprised a set of 13 steps leading down from the ground level to a landing (the first landing). The steps were about 1.1m wide necessitating negotiating them single file [2] . The first landing was about 1.1m x 1.1m. There was then a set of 8 steps continuing in the same direction leading to another landing (the second landing). The second landing was 2.25m x 1.57m [3] . A left hand turn of 180◦ led to another set of steps which led to another landing (the third landing) being the basement level.
	
	
	The vertical distance from the first landing to the third landing was about 3.2m [4] .
	
	
	The set of 13 steps was flanked by brick walls at the sides. There were no handrails in place on this set of 13 steps [5] . Mr Felemi stumbled at the bottom step or steps of this set. The wall on the left hand side (when descending) finished at the bottom step of this set. The first landing was open on the left side and walled on the right hand side. There was a horizontal timber hand rail across the open side of the first landing. It was attached to the edge of the left hand side wall, near the bottom of the flight of 13 steps leading down to the first landing. The hand rail extended horizontally and parallel to the floor of the first landing. The railing extended the length of the landing to just beyond the start of the descent of the second flight of 8 steps. There it was attached to another railing on the open side of the steps going down to the second landing.
	
	
	That other railing was attached at the top end to a vertical metal pipe which was bolted to the top step below the first landing. The metal pipe had a piece at its top shaped something like a U in which the other railing sat. There are several photographs of what I have described [6] .
	
	
	The horizontal railing at the first landing was 1.2m long. The top surface of the railing was 1.1m above the floor of the first landing and the bottom surface, 1.03m [7] . There was no other railing or structure in place on that side of the first landing [8] .
	
	
	On the day of the incident, Mr Felemi and others had been working on Level 4 [9]  of one of the high rise residential towers. This tower was known as Quadrant 1. Mr Felemi ceased work for the day at about 3.00pm and was heading to the locker room in the basement with three others. They were Mr El Masri, Mr Semi and Mr Lusseni.
	
	
	The four men were walking down the flight of steps to the first landing. They were descending in single file. The order in which they were walking was Mr El Masri first, then Mr Felemi, then Mr Semi and then Mr Lusseni. They were talking. Mr El Masri from time to time turned his head over towards his left shoulder as they were walking down the stairs.
	
	
	Towards the end of the flight of steps leading to the first landing, Mr Felemi lost his footing. It was his left foot that was affected. Whether he twisted, tripped, slipped or suffered some other mishap is not clear. The result was he left the stairway and fell. In the course of falling, his body turned so that he was head down. He landed on his head. Before doing so, he may also have hit his head on the wall or on steps on the way down.
	
	
	This much that I have recited is not in contention or cannot seriously be contentious. To the extent that any of it is in contention, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of those matters.
	
	
	What is in contention is whether Mr Felemi, when he left the first landing, went under or over the horizontal timber railing. At one level this issue does not matter. Even if Mr Felemi went over the railing, the issue remains whether there was a risk of falling under the railing. Where the issue matters is whether the risk existed or could be foreseen. If Mr Felemi went over the railing, that provides a basis for contending that no risk ever materialised and accordingly one did not exist or, if it did, it could not have been foreseen.
	
	
	There is some hearsay evidence that Mr Felemi went over the railing. There is also hearsay evidence he went under the railing. I take no account of it. The source of the hearsay that he went over the railing clearly enough was Mr El Masri and he gave evidence. Mr Semi and Mr Lusseni also gave evidence and it is the evidence of these three I draw on to reach my conclusion. Mr Felemi also gave evidence, but cannot assist on this as, from the moment of losing his footing, he has no memory of anything that assists on this issue. These four were the only eye witnesses capable of giving evidence as to what happened.
	
	
	Mr Semi said he saw Mr Felemi’s foot go through the hole between the top railing and the landing. He saw his body go through the hole [10] . Mr Lusseni saw Mr Felemi fall through the railing under the rail [11] . Mr El Masri’s evidence was changeable [12] .
	
	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that when Mr Felemi fell from the first landing, he went under, rather than over, the rail. Mr reasons for that are as follows.
	



	
	Mr Semi and Mr Lusseni were in a better position to see what happened than was Mr El Masri as they were both behind Mr Felemi and Mr El Masri was in front of him.
	
	
	Mr El Masri commented soon after the event happened that Mr Felemi had gone over the railing. He has not adhered to that.
	
	
	Mr Semi and Mr Lusseni both gave evidence that, as to some details, may be thought to cast doubt on their evidence that Mr Felemi went under the timber rail. Mr Lusseni, for example, agreed in cross-examination that the answer he gave in an interview to SafeWork inspectors on 11 February 2015 and recorded in Q23 was a different account to the evidence he gave.
	


That needs to be understood in its context. It followed cross-examination over a period in which he firmly adhered to his evidence that he saw Mr Felemi lose his footing and he saw him going under the railing. The evidence in which he agreed the accounts were different was as follows [13] :

Q. You agree with me that what you’ve just told his Honour and again I make it very clear I’m not suggesting you’re lying but what you’ve just told his Honour is not what you told the inspectors in relation to question 23 and the answer there. You don’t actually give that version to the inspectors, do you agree with that?

A. I agree with that but there’s - it’s not everything.

Q. I’m not being critical I’m just saying that what you’ve just said to his Honour is different than what appears at question 23 and answer, do you agree with that?

A. Yes.

The answer to Question 23 [14] , as put to Mr Lusseni, was as follows:

“I saw the ending of it so I saw, what I saw was the moment when his whole body just managed to get from underneath the railing.

So he was already out of the railing.

His leg was already down off the landing and legs were coming up.

So he was basically in a horizontal position, sorry, horizontal.

Yeah, horizontal position off the landing so he was in mid-air when my eye caught him.”

To the extent that there is any difference, it is in respect of detail that I do not consider significant. I consider the accounts are essentially consistent. Variations in detail are what one would expect when accounts are given on different occasions, especially two years apart and in different circumstances.

Not only in the evidence leading up to the apparent concession as to the different accounts did Mr Lusseni maintain his evidence that Mr Felemi fell under the handrail, but he also maintained that evidence in further cross-examination after that apparent concession.

Mr Lusseni was a most impressive witness and so was Mr Semi and they were rock solid in their evidence that Mr Felemi went under the rail. I was impressed by them and their evidence and I accept it.


	
	Mr Semi saw Mr Felemi’s foot go through the hole, that is, the hole between the railing and the landing [15] .
	
	
	Accepting, as I do, that Mr Felemi’s left foot went out under the railing, it is almost impossible to conceive of a scenario that would allow him to go over the railing.
	
	
	I am not impressed by “objective” evidence which was thought by some to be blood and foot marks on the wall. Before the incident, this stairway had been used at least six times day, by about 300 workers, for about six months. Inevitably, the walls would be marked.
	
	
	I reject the submission that the SafeWork inspectors had a conversation in which they discussed the improbability of Mr Felemi having gone under the railing. It is not supported by the transcript reference relied on [16] . Nor do I consider it is supported by Exhibit PX16B. The audio on Exhibit PX16B is not clear and is hampered by considerable background noise. I have listened to it dozens of times through different headsets and at different volumes. The best I can make out of is, “Do you want to film me walking down the stairs … and (or am) just seeing if it’s possible”. The highest it got from Inspector Hill on this point was that he could not see how the accident happened [17] .
	
	
	I do not consider that the investigation or the nature of the investigation undertaken by the investigators in any way casts doubt on my finding that Mr Felemi fell under the railing.
	


The particulars of the charge


	
	At this point it is useful to look at the particulars of the charge that have been levelled against Freyssinet. In their final form, they are contained in [6] of the Further Amended Summons as follows:
	


The Defendant failed to ensure the health and safety of workers, in particular, Mr Felemi, in that it failed to take one or more of the following reasonably practicable measures to eliminate (or, alternatively, minimise if not reasonably practicable to eliminate) the risks to health and safety of workers including the risk of falling from height by:

Instructing workers not to access stairways and steps at the site unless they were fitted with adequate edge protection;

and in particular instructing workers, including Mr Felemi, not to use the stairway until an intermediate rail was fitted, or until other suitable guarding was installed that removed or minimised the risk; and/or

Ensuring that all stairways and steps at the site were fitted with guard railing which, if of post and rail construction, either comprised a top rail with one or more intermediate rails spaced such that the maximum clear space between the rails or between the lowest rail and any toe board, where fitted, did not exceed 450mm or, alternatively, fitted with other means such as guard railing of welded mesh construction, which in any case complied with the requirements of Australian Standard AS 1657-2013 “Fixed Platforms, walkways, stairways and ladders – Design, construction and installation”; and/or

Identifying that the stairway was not fitted with adequate guard-railing and requesting Karimbla install adequate guard-railing such as an intermediate rail on the landings, or other suitable guarding that would remove or minimise the risk.

Elements of the offence


	
	There is contention between the parties as to the elements of the offence. It does not matter. Whatever the elements, Freyssinet admits all of them except two. It denies that it failed to comply with its health and safety duty. It also denies that any alleged failure exposed an individual to a risk of death or serious injury. The prosecutor acknowledges that these are elements that must be proved beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	It is useful, nevertheless, to set out the elements of the offence. They are to be derived from a combination of sections 19(1) and 32.
	
	
	The starting point is s 32. Under that section, three elements must be established:
	



	
	Freyssinet must have had a health and safety duty;
	
	
	Freyssinet must have failed to comply with that duty;
	
	
	the failure must have exposed an individual to a risk of death or serious injury.
	



	
	As to the first of those elements, it is necessary to turn to s 19(1) to determine if Freyssinet had a health and safety duty. Freyssinet will have had such a duty if the elements of s 19(1) are satisfied. Those elements are:
	



	
	Freyssinet must have been a person conducting a business or undertaking;
	
	
	Freyssinet must have engaged workers;
	
	
	those workers must have been at work in the business or undertaking of Freyssinet.
	



	
	Combined, the elements of the offence are:
	



	
	Freyssinet must have been a person conducting a business or undertaking;
	
	
	Freyssinet must have engaged workers;
	
	
	those workers must have been at work in the business or undertaking of Freyssinet.
	


If those elements are established, then Freyssinet was under a health and safety duty. It is then necessary to establish the following further elements:


	
	Freyssinet must have failed to comply with that duty;
	
	
	the failure must have exposed an individual to a risk of death or serious injury.
	



	
	It is the last two elements that are in issue in these proceedings.
	
	
	The elements I have set out will not be of universal application. They will not, for example, be the elements where the relationship between the person charged and the person allegedly exposed to risk is different to the relationship in these proceedings.
	
	
	It remains important to bear in mind that the duty is limited by the section to ensuring health and safety so far as that is reasonably practicable. In this regard, Freyssinet’s function on the site limited to post tensioning is relevant. That is a relevant factor, but not a determinative one. All circumstances must be considered to determine what was reasonably practicable. Freyssinet’s task and its contract with Karimbla cannot be determinative of the limit of Freyssinet’s health and safety duty.
	
	
	Under the contract between Karimbla and Freyssinet, and in practice, Karimbla had extensive safety responsibilities in relation to the site. These proceedings are not about Karimbla’s responsibilities. They are about Freyssinet’s health and safety duty and that duty, whatever its extent may be, cannot be limited by agreement with Karimbla or by Karimbla’s assumption of health and safety responsibilities or by Freyssinet’s reliance on Karimbla to provide safe access.
	


Evidence as to the work site


	
	It is now useful to turn to the remaining evidence concerning the work site.
	
	
	At the site, a large residential complex was in the course of construction. It was as large as five to six football fields, with over 1200 units to be built [18] . It was to consist of four high rise towers. Each tower was to be 15 levels when completed [19] . They were identified by quadrant numbers 1, 2, 3, 4. The head contractor and builder on the site was Karimbla. Karimbla was a company within the Meriton group of companies. It was sometimes in the evidence identified as and treated synonymously with Meriton.
	
	
	Karimbla had contracted with a number of trades for the carrying out of different aspects of the construction work. Freyssinet was one of those subcontractors.
	
	
	Freyssinet’s task on the site was post tensioning work. This involved the laying and tensioning of cables preparatory to concrete laying. It was a specialised task and Freyssinet’s work was limited to that.
	
	
	Freyssinet employed Mr Felemi, Mr El Masri, Mr Semi and Mr Lusseni. It also employed Mr Smales, Mr Vieira and others. Mr Smales was employed by Freyssinet as its supervisor. Mr Vieira was employed by Freyssinet as its leading hand.
	
	
	Mr Felemi was employed as a concrete reinforcing stressor. His job involved installing cable stressing before the concrete pour [20] . He had worked at the site from July 2014. Mr El Masri, Mr Semi and Mr Lusseni were doing similar work.
	
	
	At the time of the incident, there were about 300 workers on the site employed by Karimbla or by its various subcontractors [21] .
	
	
	Work was being undertaken on Quadrants 1 and 2.
	
	
	Servicing the site was a basement area which included workers’ lockers, lunch room, toilets and offices. It serviced the whole of the site. The basement was accessed by a stairway by each of the workers several times a day. The stairway was described by Mr Vieira as like a highway, by reason of its frequent use [22] .
	
	
	The basement had at last three accesses. Sometimes one or more of the accesses would not be accessible because work was being done on or in it. Karimbla directed the access that was to be used at any given time. It did so by placing tape and signs on the site indicating the access to be used [23] .
	
	
	I have described earlier at [11] to [15] the stairway. That stairway was the one in use at the time of the incident and had been so for about six months. The other stairways could have been used at the time of the incident. In fact at least one of them was, as the one from which Mr Felemi fell was barricaded very soon after the incident. Over the six months before the incident, the stairway from which Mr Felemi fell remained in the same condition particularly as to the placement and position of handrails. [24] 
	


Evidence as to safety measures

The Karimbla induction


	
	Freyssinet’s safe work system included the Karimbla induction. Every worker who came on to the site was inducted onto the site by Karimbla. Freyssinet maintained a record of its employees having been inducted by Karimbla [25] . The induction included a site safety quiz which Mr Felemi undertook [26] . The induction also included a Safe Work Method Statement (SWMS) for general construction work for the site [27] . A transcript for the induction is at Exhibit PX 10, Tab H.
	
	
	An example of the content of that induction and the one used for Mr Felemi’s induction is in Exhibit PX 1, Vol 1, Tab 11, p 162. Each worker was inducted in relation to the matters in that document. It covered many matters. Significantly, for present purposes, it included the following questions:
	


2. Do you know who to talk to if you have any questions or problems?

…

14. Have you read and understood your Safe Work Method Statements

(original emphasis)


	
	Mr Felemi, and all workers, knew to talk to the leading hand with any questions or problems [28] .
	


The Freyssinet induction


	
	At the outset, I note a summary of steps put forward in Freyssinet’s submissions as to its system for identifying and addressing risks. It is,
	



	
	emphasising to its workers the importance, to its workers, of identifying risks;
	
	
	training its workers to identify risks;
	
	
	empowering workers to refuse to perform work, or to undertake any activity, that the worker considered to be unsafe;
	
	
	implementing a comprehensive system of documented Safe Work Method Procedures for dealing with dangerous equipment or undertaking dangerous work;
	
	
	reiterating directly to employees, on an ongoing basis, the importance of ensuring safety while at work;
	
	
	conducting regular toolbox talks (TBTs) at which safety was a common feature; and
	
	
	relying on an expert principal contractor to provide safe access and egress through common areas of the site used by multiple subcontractors and controlled by the principal contractor. [29] 
	


To that may be added daily pre-start meetings.


	
	The Freyssinet induction followed the Karimbla induction. An example of the content of this induction and the one undertaken by Mr Felemi is in Exhibit PX 1, Vol 1, Tab 16, p266. It included the following.
	


You have been told who the Leading Hand and Safety Representative is for the project?

…

If I have any questions of concerns about my safety, or the safety of those around me, I will stop work and speak to my Supervisor/Leading Hand

Mr Felemi knew who the Leading Hand, Safety Representative and Supervisor were.


	
	The other Freyssinet workers also underwent site induction with Freyssinet [30] . They were taught that if there was a safety concern to report it to the safety representative. The safety representative would raise it with the builder [31] .
	
	
	Instruction as to what to do about safety depended on the situation. An imminent issue would involve blocking off the area and reporting it immediately. If it was minor, it could be dealt with on the spot and reported later [32] .
	
	
	Induction documents for the Freyssinet workers included SWMSs, Exhibits DX 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

	Mr Felemi understood the references in the tables in the previous paragraph to be applying to the working area [34] . He understood that if there was not correct edge protection, he was to report it to his leading hand [35] . An occasion to inform his leading hand about edge protection had occurred. He spoke to the leading hand or builder, Karimbla, and Karimbla fixed it [36] .
	
	
	In the context of SWMSs, Mr Vieira agreed with the proposition that the key point for workers employed by Freyssinet was not to work near areas where there was a fall hazard. [37] 
	
	
	Mr Felemi was also inducted, as were other Freyssinet employees, in respect of numerous other documents involving tools, plant or work processes [38] .
	
	
	There were pre-start safety talks with Freyssinet workers before the commencement of work every day [39] . Mr Lusseni explained that pre-start meetings were thorough about the day’s work and safety if need be.
	
	
	There were TBTs once per week. Safety issues could and would be raised at these talks [40] . TBTs were essentially about safety and in addition to weekly were also held on an as-needs basis [41] . Freyssinet maintained records of TBTs [42] .
	
	
	There was a system in place known to all the Freyssinet workers that if there were any safety issues they were to be drawn to the attention of the leading hand or someone they were working with [43] .
	
	
	Freyssinet employed personnel whose duty it was to attend to matters of safety. At the time of the incident and for some time before, it employed Mr Vieira. It also employed Mr Smales as a supervisor.
	
	
	Mr Vieira had no formal training. His learning was all on the job [44] . His responsibilities included identifying safety issues including working at heights and controls for that [45] . Part of his job before the incident was to check stairways [46] .
	
	
	Mr Smales had done courses for risk management and health and safety representative and numerous other courses. He had training identifying hazards. This included training about risks involved with working at heights and control measures for that [47] .
	
	
	Mr Smales described his duties as including allocation of man power and setting up of work areas. His duties were described in a Freyssinet “Roles and Responsibilities” document [48]  as including,
	


In conjunction with the Leading Hand, arrange pre starts, tool box meetings, safety talks and demonstrations to promote safety and environmental awareness. Recording toolbox meetings on the AF-S-REP-555 Record of Tool Box Meeting form and submitting the report to the QSE Coordinator.


	
	Safety issues could be fixed in a number of ways. Some could be fixed by Freyssinet itself. Some could be fixed by asking the appropriate subcontractor to do it. Some could be fixed through the safety committee and by asking Karimbla to do it. Under this system, if ever there was a safety issue, the majority of times it was fixed [49] .
	
	
	As part of Freyssinet’s safety approach it had a representative on the site’s safety committee. That was Mr Cameron Valentine. Each company on the site had a representative on the safety committee. They did a safety walk each week [50] .
	
	
	Freyssinet completed monthly safety reports and provided them to Karimbla [51] . This was a Karimbla requirement. The report required the subcontractor to provide information on work activity with assessments, changes to SWMSs, training and induction of employees and any non-compliances or reportable matters. Once a month, Mr Vieira would complete one of these forms and supply it to Karimbla [52] . All reports in the months leading up to the incident revealed Freyssinet was compliant.
	
	
	Mr Vieira was also familiar with and used Freyssinet’s Workplace Inspection Checklist [53] . It was to identify any safety issues [54] . That was completed weekly [55] . It was the leading hand’s responsibility [56] . This form required Mr Vieira to have checked over 100 safety items and mark off on them. In the months leading up to the incident there was no item requiring attention. Mr Vieira did a regular inspection and completed such a checklist [57] . If a matter needed fixing, he would go to the person responsible [58] . That may be the Karimbla site supervisor.
	
	
	Mr Vieira did risk assessments including where there was a risk of a person falling two metres or more [59] . Part of his job was to check whether access and work platforms met or exceeded legislative and standard requirements. [60] 
	
	
	At the time of the incident, Mr Benjamin Reyes was the national safety manager for Freyssinet [61] . He gave evidence that once a week, workers undertook a workplace inspection. That included access to and egress from the working areas. It would not be practical to inspect access and egress over the entire work site. In a number of answers, Mr Reyes confined the safety assessment of access to accesses to working platforms. There were, however, two answers where his evidence was not so confined. The first was as follows [62] ,
	


Q.   The hazard identification, does that extend to all areas where workers need to access in order to get to a work site?

A.   Utilising designated pathways is the extent of which we identify further access ways on site. [63] 

The stairway was part of a designated pathway to and from the working deck.


	
	The second answer was as follows,
	


Q.    How about access and egress that the workers actually use from wherever they start in the day to the workplace?

A.   Onto the working deck, yes.

Q.   That's possible--

A.   --That's the intent of this.

Q.   It's possible is it for a check to be done or inspection to be done of the access and egress from the lunch room up to the working deck?

A.   It all depends - this is a workplace inspection that's done once a week. Workplace access and egress being a dynamic construction site can change between the time the workers start to the time that they go to smoko. The stair case that we use or the access we use in one instance might not be the access we use at another. We're given a moments notice so using the designated access that the head contractor provides us is generally what the gentlemen will do going to and from the workplace. This particular workplace inspection check list will identify any access and egress onto the working deck which is designated the workplace for the, the PT workers.  [64] 


	
	There was nothing dynamic about the stairway. It was a fixture. It was used every day for about six months before the incident. Over that six month period, it did not change, and nor did the railing. It remained as I have described in [11] to [15].
	
	
	Freyssinet also had a Workplace Inspection Report [65] . This was also a document prepared weekly by Mr Vieira. It recorded results of inspection where there was a matter of safety, the action to be taken, when the task was to be completed and when it was completed. These reports disclose occasionally an issue relating to hand rails. This appears on 18 occasions between 1 September 2014 and 2 February 2015. In each instance, the place where attention was required was a working site and not a stairwell or access. On all but one occasion the matter was attended to on the day it was raised or the following day.
	
	
	Freyssinet communicated the content of its QSE Common Rules [66]  to all its employees [67] . That content included a direction that all access and work platforms be checked and tagged by a suitably qualified and competent worker before authorising access to Freyssinet workers [68] . Mr Smales considered that applied to working areas [69] . It also included the following:
	


When safety elements (access, work platforms …) are to be contractually provided by a third party, they must be supplied as requested. All access and work platforms must meet or exceed legislative and standards requirements.

In the event of third party not providing the required access, we must not enter the area concerned and refer without delay to the Company Management. [70] 


	
	In the context of checking and tagging, Mr Smales was asked about the stairway. His answer was [71] ,
	


That stairwell or the stairwells to get down to the lunch rooms, again with a changing area, some areas are sometimes closed off, sometimes they were reopened again so they could change from day to day.

Tagging was not a measure appropriate for the stairway, but this was not on the basis that the area was changing. The stairway had not changed for about six months before the incident.


	
	Mr Smales said that if an access or work platform did not meet the required standards, Freyssinet would go to Karimbla, or to whomever was responsible for the task, and ask for it to be fixed [72] . It was also the practice if the required access was not provided not to enter the area and to refer the matter to the Karimbla management. [73] .
	
	
	The QSE Common Rules also required a Project Risk Assessment be available for this project [74] . There was. It was a Karimbla document [75] . It contained some detailed information about working at heights. It did not specifically deal with staircases.
	
	
	The “PROJECT RISK ASSESSMENT” document [76]  also set out the responsibilities of the leading hand [77] . They included responsibility for the health and safety of workers. If Mr Vieira identified a hazardous situation, he could fix it and tell the site supervisor [78] .
	
	
	Freyssinet had a Take Five system [79] . This was an opportunity for a worker to take five (minutes) to look at his work site and raise any matters of concern he might have.
	
	
	Freyssinet’s processes included identifying the risk, assessing it, using the risk matrix, controlling it using the best risk control, documenting it on a template and re-evaluating as new hazards arose [80] . If control measures were not effective, work was to cease [81] . Employees were taught that if there was an access or work platform that did not meet legislative or standards’ requirements, they should not go there [82] . It was part of Mr Vieira’s job to check that accesses and work platforms met legislative and Standards’ requirements. [83] 
	


Documents


	
	In addition to documents already referred to, there were others.
	
	
	The “OUR SAFETY VALUES AND GUIDING BEHAVIOURS” document was a Meriton document being a mission statement document, a document of guiding principles [84] .
	
	
	The “WHS AND E MANAGEMENT PLAN” was a Meriton/Karimbla document prepared for the site [85] . This was at one time called “OHS & E MANAGEMENT PLAN” [86] . It is a general, overall document. The SWMSs are task-specific documents [87] .
	
	
	The “PROJECT QUALITY, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT PLAN” document was a Freyssinet document prepared for the site [88] . The purpose of this document was to set out how work was to be done in a manner ensuring safety as far as that could be ensured [89] .
	
	
	The “PROJECT QUALITY, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT PLAN” document had documents within it. One was entitled “Roles and Responsibilities”. The responsibilities of the National Safety Manager were set out in it [90] . One of the responsibilities was organisation of safety committee meetings. Mr Reyes had responsibility for making sure they were organised as per legislation. The committee met on a monthly basis [91] . His responsibility also included tasks in respect of “high risk projects”. The task in this case was not considered a high risk project [92] .
	
	
	Within the “PROJECT QUALITY, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT PLAN” document also was a “Safety Management Manual”. One of the things it required was a project manager engineer to identify hazards/risks in meeting with the safety manager, quality manager, QSE coordinator, site supervisor and leading hands. Mr Reyes considered this was a reference to Freyssinet employees [93] . One of the hazards to which consideration was given was working access and heights. If there was a risk of a person falling two metres or more, Freyssinet’s approach was to adopt risk control measures. Those measures would include protective barriers and edge protection [94] . The edge protection would be a post and rail barrier with a mid-rail, handrail and possibly toe board [95] . This was a detail Freyssinet included in its tender documents [96] . It applied to the working deck and access to the working deck [97] .
	
	
	Karimbla provided Safety Observation Report forms [98] . Completion of these by subcontractors was part of the process of subcontractors, including Freyssinet, monitoring and reviewing their SWMSs and reporting this to Karimbla.
	
	
	Karimbla had a Workplace Safety Committee [99]  and it maintained a record of safety committee inspections [100] .
	
	
	Freyssinet had a document entitled “Edge Protection Requirements” [101] . This is a post-incident document, but a later iteration of a document that existed prior to the incident. The earlier version did not specifically refer to guardrail, mid-rail or toe board. It mentioned the standards required. This document was prepared for the workers.
	
	
	Under “DISCUSSION POINT” the Edge Protection Requirements document contained the following [102] :
	



	
	No works are to be conducted in an area of 3 meters [sic] around unprotected floor or edge openings;
	
	
	Where there are unprotected floor or edge openings, or permanent structure stairs being used as access ways which do not have supports, a mid and guardrail; notify the client using a hazardous observation notice.
	


Mr Reyes agreed that the “DISCUSSION POINT” was to discuss with workers that things such as unprotected floor, edge openings and permanent structure stairs being used as access ways should have supports, being a mid-rail and guardrail and, if not, the client should be notified. He considered that the reference to permanent structure stairs was a reference to stairs such as the stairway. [103] 


	
	There was in place at the time of the incident a Standard – Australian Standard AS1657-2013 “Fixed platforms, walkways, stairways and ladders – Design, construction and installation” (the Standard) [104] .
	
	
	The Standard applied to the stairway. It required guardrailing and handrails. The Standard required guardrailing to be installed on the exposed side of the stairway and landing being the side from which Mr Felemi fell. It specified the nature of the guardrailing required. In broad terms, it required a top rail, an intermediate rail or welded mesh [105] .
	


After the incident


	
	A steel mesh barrier was put up at the base of the stairs after the incident [106] . Inspectors Hills and Reyes attended the site on 11 February 2015 before 9.00am. Inspector Hill directed the stairway to be barricaded at the lower levels. He conducted some interviews.
	
	
	The inspectors left the site at about 2.20pm. This was earlier than intended. It was because news, incorrect as it turned out, had come through that Mr Felemi had died.
	
	
	Inspectors Hill and Reyes returned on 12 February 2015. Measurements, photos and a video were taken [107] . I have made some observations about one of these videos earlier at [23].
	
	
	Inspector Hill directed Karimbla to undertake remedial steps. He required a minimum of a secure top rail, mid-rail and kickboard. His notebook records “Adequate materials are to be used to ensure structural integrity. To ensure all holes within the vertical members base plates” [108] . A couple of hours later, when he checked the work that had been done, he was not satisfied with it. This time his notebook records “Deemed inadequate due to both integrity + obstructed walkway top landing, meshing stuck out”. The obstruction related to the handrail and meshing stepped out into the walkway [109] . The handrail was not affixed to the wall as it should have been. Karimbla had left a gap between the end of the top rail and the wall. As to integrity, Inspector Hill could not recall if the holes in the base plates had been attended to [110] . Inspector Hill provided further instruction for Karimbla to rectify the problem. The problem was then rectified [111] .
	
	
	A couple of days after the incident, Mr Lusseni raised with Karimbla an issue in respect of a lack of mid-rail. That was at the edge of a building. He got a response that he was going overboard, but after raising the matter with Mr Smales, it was attended to [112] .
	
	
	Freyssinet changed its documentation after the incident to specifically include stairways [113] . After the incident, Karimbla prepared a high risk SWMS for installing handrails and fire stairs [114] .
	


Analysis


	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was a risk, that the risk ought to have been known to Freyssinet and that Freyssinet could and should have taken remedial action to address the risk.
	
	
	The risk is defined in [5] in the Further Amended Summons as:
	


“… the risk to workers, including Mr Felemi, of death or serious injury by falling through the unprotected gap between the edge of the stairway and the temporary handrail …”


	
	It is clear that all elements of the offence are established necessary and sufficient to find that Freyssinet had a health and safety duty within the meaning of s 32(a) of the Act. The duty was to ensure health and safety “as far as (was) reasonably practicable”.
	


There was a risk


	
	Common sense suggests, even dictates, that the configuration of the stairway and handrail at the time of the incident meant that there was a risk. At the first landing, there was a significant gap formed roughly by the floor of the landing and the handrail as the horizontal boundaries and the edge of the wall and the metal pipe as the vertical boundaries. Its dimensions were approximately 1.1m horizontally and 1.03m vertically. That is a gap of dimensions sufficiently large for any person to fall through should he or she slip, trip or fall on the steps or landing. Images of this gap are contained in several photographs [115] . There was a risk of fall, slip or trip over the exposed edge. Such an event could result in a fall to the third or bottom landing of over three metres. Such a fall could result in serious injury or death. The one handrail in place meant that, compared to there being no handrail, the risk of accidentally falling from the exposed edge was lessened. It did not eliminate that risk.
	
	
	I reject the submission that investigators investigating the incident commented that they could not see how the incident occurred. The evidence does not support this. I also reject any submission to the effect that there was any pushing, shoving or horseplay involved in the occurrence of the incident. The evidence does not support this. For reasons given elsewhere, I am satisfied that the evidence given by Mr Semi and Mr Lusseni to the effect that Mr Felemi accidentally fell and went under the handrail is to be accepted.
	


The risk ought to have been known to Freyssinet


	
	The risk ought to have been known to Freyssinet.
	
	
	There was an issue as to whether Freyssinet was aware of the condition of the stairway, in particular, that it had a top rail only and no mid-rail and if it was aware of that whether it was aware of the risk. The evidence as to Freyssinet’s actual knowledge comes from Mr Smales.
	
	
	I was impressed by Mr Smales as a witness, but he did give some evidence that was confusing. In chief he said that he had used the stairway before the incident. I am satisfied that this was so and that it was in the week before the incident as he was on site for about a week before the incident. He then said that he identified that it had no mid-rail [116] . He said that he spoke to someone, probably Mr Valentine, about it. I am satisfied that he did speak to someone about it, that it was probably Mr Valentine, though that is not critical, and that it was in the week before the incident. Mr Valentine was Freyssinet’s representative on the site’s safety committee. Mr Smales thought he probably raised it with Mr Vieira but he could not recall that [117] . The point of raising this with Mr Valentine, or whomever, and maybe Mr Vieira is that if there was no mid-rail, there was a safety issue. In cross-examination he said he had used the stairway and he did not notice it as being unsafe. He would have raised it if he did. Later in cross-examination, it was sought to establish that the earlier evidence had not been directed to the stairway in question, but to staircases generally and Mr Smales agreed with this. The evidence first given in chief by Mr Smales that he identified no mid-rail was so clearly related to the subject matter of the stairway that the answer must be read as directed to that and not to staircases generally. He also gave some evidence in re-examination that confirmed his evidence in-chief, but he later had doubts about that [118] . I think Mr Smales has probably conflated the stairway and stairways at the site generally and had not appreciated any distinction when he gave that answer, and the answer was not intended to refer to the stairway.
	
	
	I am satisfied that Mr Smales did use the stairway before the incident. I am satisfied it was then in the condition it was in at the time of the incident, that is there was no mid-rail. His raising the matter of no mid-rail with Mr Valentine, or whomever, went to stairways generally.
	
	
	I am not satisfied that Freyssinet had actual knowledge of the risk in relation to the stairway.
	
	
	The absence of a mid-rail posed or was capable of posing a safety risk. Mr Smales was aware of that. That was the point of his reporting the absence of mid-rails generally to Mr Valentine, or whomever he reported it to. Mr Smales’s raising of the issue establishes Freyssinet was aware of the risk of injury, including serious injury, by reason of falls from stairways.
	
	
	There were ways other than Mr Smales’s knowledge in which Freyssinet was aware that the absence of a mid-rail or other edge protection on an exposed edge of a staircase posed a risk of falling.
	
	
	One way is demonstrated through Freyssinet’s tendering process where Freyssinet included, as part of its tendering documents, a standard condition that it required head contractors to comply with. That was that where workers were working at height where they could fall two metres or more, edge protection in the form of handrail, mid-rail and, maybe, toe board were required [119] . The purpose of this was to prevent workers and materials falling through the gap [120] . This evidence may be confined to the working platform, but there is no reason why the principle or purpose underlying it would not apply to other surfaces where workers could fall two metres or more. The only difference could be in the degree of risk.
	
	
	Another way in which Freyssinet was aware that the absence of a mid-rail or other edge protection on an exposed edge of a staircase posed a risk of falling lies in other documents of Freyssinet. Several of Freyssinet’s documents support the fact that Freyssinet knew of the risk of serious injury that could result from fall from heights. Any one of these documents alone supports this. The documents are:
	



	
	the plant risk assessments referred to in [53] above. These specifically address “Falls from Heights” and “Falling due to no edge protection”;
	
	
	the Workplace Inspection Checklist referred to in [67] above had a section dealing with prevention of falls which included work platforms and guarding [121] ;
	
	
	the Workplace Inspection Reports referred to in [72] above which record, from 1 September 2014 to 2 February 2015, 18 instances relating to handrails. The purpose of handrails was to prevent falls from exposed edges;
	
	
	Project Quality, Safety and Environment Plan referred to in [85] above which, in several instances, refers to working at heights or fall from heights or using effecting barriers and edge protection [122] ;
	
	
	the precursor of the “Edge Protection Requirements” document referred to in [88] and following above. There were differences between the precursor document and the document in evidence, but not such as to affect this point.
	



	
	Even if these documents did not apply to the stairway because they were confined in their application to high risk construction activities or to working platforms or accesses leading directly to working platforms, they nevertheless establish that Freyssinet was aware of the risk of injury in fall from heights. The circumstances on a working platform may well be different to the circumstances in using a staircase, but a fall from height remains a fall from height with the same potential consequences, whatever the circumstances. The prospects of such a fall from a staircase may be considerably less than from a working platform, but that does not affect the fact under consideration here and that is that Freyssinet knew of the risk of injury involved in a fall from height.
	
	
	Freyssinet’s knowledge of the risk of injury involved in fall from height is also established by the testamentary evidence. That evidence included the following:
	



	
	the evidence of Mr Smales referred to in [62] and [105] above;
	
	
	the evidence of Mr Vieira referred to in [68] above;
	
	
	the evidence of Mr Reyes referred to at [85] and [89] above.
	



	
	Even if the evidence I have referred to above does not establish that Freyssinet was aware that the absence of a mid-rail on an exposed edge of a staircase posed a risk of falling with potentially consequent serious injury, it does establish that Freyssinet ought to have been aware of this. There is other evidence that establishes that Freyssinet ought to have been so aware.
	
	
	I take judicial notice of the fact that in residential and commercial premises, the open side of a staircase has a handrail and an infill between the handrail and the landing or stairs, the infill being balusters or near horizontal parallel rails, or some other form of infill. This is commonplace and notorious [123] . Building sites under construction are different to completed residential and commercial premises. There is accordingly a limit to which that fact can be used. It can be used to demonstrate that those infills are in place to prevent people falling over the edge of such staircases because without those infills that risk exists.
	
	
	Freyssinet ought to have been aware of the risk through the Standard. It is plain the Standard applied to the stairway and that the requirements of the Standard had not been met. For reasons which I give later [126], the prosecutor’s case on particular 6.b. is not made out. The fact that particular 6.b. is not made good does not mean that the Standard did not apply to the stairway. It applied to the stairway by its own force. Nor does the prosecutor have to make good particular 6.b. for the Standard to have relevance. It remains relevant on issues such as whether Freyssinet ought to have known that the stairway was unsafe or posed a risk and whether it ought to have known that there was any reasonably practicable way of addressing any risk.
	
	
	As a prudent and safe employer, Freyssinet ought to have known of the existence of the Standard and its contents relevant to the stairway. Freyssinet had a limited specialised role on the site. That is relevant to what work was expected of Freyssinet in the execution of the works generally and to how it should address any safety issue relating to the stairway. It cannot be used to limit the duty it owed to its own workers. The stairway was a means of access used by Freyssinet workers at the work site. It was also used by about 300 others who were workers of other subcontractors. Again, the extent of use by others cannot be used to limit the duty Freyssinet owed to its own workers. Under the contract, Karimbla assumed significant safety responsibilities. Yet again, that cannot be used to limit the duty Freyssinet owed to its own workers.
	
	
	Freyssinet had no expertise in Standards relating to staircases. It did not need any expertise. Mr Smales, without reference to any Standard, identified that an absent mid-rail on a stairway posed a risk of fall from the stairway with potential resultant injury [124] . Further, Freyssinet’s lack of expertise with respect to Standards is not to the point. The point is it had a duty to its workers. It had a duty to ensure, so far as reasonably practicable, the health and safety of its workers. That duty extended to accesses, including the stairway. Rather than rely on its lack of expertise as to staircases, edge protection and Standards, it should have undertaken a positive exercise in checking the safety of the stairway. Under its own documents, it had a duty to check that accesses and work platforms met or exceeded Standards’ requirements [125]  and this was part of Mr Vieira’s job [126] .
	
	
	The duty of an employer to an employee to provide safe access is a concept well known to and entrenched in law. Freyssinet’s health and safety duty extended to the stairway as an access. Further, Freyssinet’s documents recognise this. Those documents include:
	



	
	Freyssinet’s Workplace Inspection Checklist. It itemises over 100 matters on the checklist. Not all relate to the working platform or its direct access. Obvious examples are the items related to “Amenities” and “Traffic Control” [127] ;
	
	
	the Workplace Inspection Reports before the incident contain instances of safety issues not limited to the working platform and its accesses being attended to. These include “NEED A BETTER WALK WAY FROM Q1 TO Q2”, “Need more water taps in the middle of the site + bubblers”, “Need more taps in middle of site + Bubblers for Grouting” [128] .
	



	
	Testamentary evidence also supports Freyssinet’s recognition of the stairway as an access in respect of which it had a health and safety duty. Mr Reyes’s evidence referred to in [69] and [70] above, supports that. Less directly so does the evidence of Mr Vieira. He said he did not do a risk assessment on the stairways leading from the lunch room. The reason he volunteered was “Why would you do a risk assessment on something that you think is okay?” [129] . The reason offered was not that the stairway did not come within the role and responsibility of Freyssinet.
	
	
	There was nothing difficult or complex about the nature of the duty Freyssinet owed concerning the stairway. Despite all the evidence about the work site being an organic site and constantly changing, even during the day, that evidence does not apply to this stairway. There was no change to this stairway over the six months it was used before the incident. Further, it was used by each worker about six times per day. In very simple terms, Freyssinet had a duty to be aware of the condition of accesses its workers were using and to know whether those accesses were safe.
	
	
	The evidence establishes, and I find, Freyssinet:
	



	
	knew there was a risk of serious injury if a person were to fall from height. That height may be defined as two metres or more;
	
	
	knew that an absent mid-rail on the open edge of a staircase posed a risk of a person falling from the edge of the staircase;
	
	
	ought to have known that the stairway lacked a mid-rail;
	
	
	ought to have known that because there was no mid-rail, there was a risk of Mr Felemi falling from the open edge of the stairway.
	



	
	Freyssinet submitted that it was not reasonably practicable for it to have identified the risk for a number of reasons which are conveniently summarised at [7.26] of its written outline of submissions. That paragraph lists the following reasons:
	



	
	the remoteness of the risk;
	
	
	Freyssinet had no right to control or alter the Basement Stairway;
	
	
	the Basement Stairway was a common access way, that had been designated by the Principal Contractor as a safe means by which to access the lunch sheds;
	
	
	Karimbla had expertise as a principal contractor, including in relation to formwork, and had a process for inspecting risks arising at common areas of the Site, such as the Basement Stairway, but did not itself identify (to use the Prosecutor’s words) “that the stairway was not fitted with adequate guard-railing”;
	
	
	other subcontractors, with expertise in formwork (which Freyssinet did not have) participated in Karimbla’s common area risk identification procedure through membership of the Karimbla Site Safety Committee, but did not themselves identify “that the stairway was not fitted with adequate guard-railing”;
	
	
	the Stairwell was used by a multitude of trades on a regular basis, none of whom raised issue with the guarding at the Basement Stairway;
	
	
	it is unreasonable to require an employer to conduct a risk assessment of an entire Site that is changing on a regular basis throughout any given day, even though its workers are only required to be performing duties in a designated area.
	



	
	I do not accept Freyssinet’s submission in circumstances where:
	



	
	falls from heights at work were identified by Freyssinet as risks;
	
	
	it had identified in fact that absent mid-rails on stairs were a risk;
	
	
	its health and safety duty applied to the work site and accesses used by its workers at the work site;
	
	
	it should have been aware of the condition of the work site and of the accesses;
	
	
	had it been so aware, it would have been aware of the absence of a mid-rail;
	
	
	the absent mid-rail posed a risk of fall with potential serious injury, being a risk of the nature of which Freyssinet was aware;
	
	
	the risk was obvious even though it had not been acted on by anyone before the incident.
	


Freyssinet should have addressed the risk


	
	There was remedial action available to Freyssinet to eliminate or minimise the risk. This calls for a consideration of the particulars that have been levelled against Freyssinet. The particulars are set out at [24] above.
	


Particular 6.b.


	
	The prosecutor must fail in respect of particular 6.b. This is for two reasons. The first is that the particular requires a standard of Freyssinet that the Act does not. The Act requires ensuring health and safety so far as is reasonably practicable. The particular would impose an obligation of ensuring not so limited. The second reason is that the particular seeks to put on Freyssinet an obligation in relation to “all stairways and steps at the site”. There were several stairways and steps at the site, some of which Freyssinet had nothing to do with. There cannot have been any obligation on Freyssinet to do anything about those stairways and steps.
	
	
	Of the remaining two particulars, I find it convenient to deal with them in reverse order.
	
	
	In considering these particulars, it is important to bear in mind that Freyssinet’s obligation extended only to what was reasonably practicable. I accept Freyssinet’s submission that just because a step may be taken, that of itself will not amount to a breach [130] .
	
	
	Breach involves consideration of what was reasonably practicable and that brings matters in s 18, as well as other matters into consideration. I consider these in the discussion below.
	
	
	I start by making some observations specific to the first two items in s 18.
	
	
	There was some debate about the meaning of “the likelihood of the hazard or the risk concerned occurring”. It does not matter. I need to consider two matters. I need to consider whether a risk existed and, if it did, the likelihood of its coming to fruition. I have determined that a risk as particularised existed. That was a risk to Mr Felemi of death or serious injury from falling through the gap between the edge of the stairway and the hand-rail.
	
	
	The next matter to consider is the likelihood that he would so fall and suffer death or serious injury.
	
	
	The likelihood of that occurring was slight. Freyssinet calculated, and it was not challenged, that before the incident there were over 200,000 movements of workers on the stairway without incident. That is a relevant consideration pointing to the unlikelihood of the incident occurring. I do not find the fact that the inspectors investigated the scene without harnesses to be at all persuasive. The circumstances were entirely different.
	
	
	The second item is “the degree of harm that might result from the hazard or the risk”. It cannot be in doubt that fatality was a foreseeable consequence of a person falling from the first landing of the stairway to the third landing.
	


Particular 6.c.


	
	Particular 6.c. states that Freyssinet failed to take the step of:
	


Identifying that the stairway was not fitted with adequate guard-railing and requesting Karimbla install adequate guard-railing such as an intermediate rail on the landings, or other suitable guarding that would remove or minimise the risk.


	
	There are, in effect, two aspects of this particular. One is identifying the condition of the stairway and the other is making a particular request of Karimbla.
	
	
	Freyssinet did not identify that the stairway was not fitted with adequate guardrailing. It should have identified this. Had it identified this, there is a number of things it could have done. The one relied on by the prosecutor here is to have requested Karimbla to “install adequate guard-railing such as an intermediate rail on the landings, or other suitable guarding that would remove or minimise the risk”. That was a simple step to take. It was a step in accordance with practice on the site where if safety issues arose, they were addressed with the appropriate subcontractor or the builder (Karimbla). Mr Smales raised the issue of the absence of mid-rails in relation to staircases generally with Mr Valentine [131]  or some other person. Either of these gentlemen could have raised the matter with Karimbla and made the request identified in the particular.
	
	
	The evidence does establish that where requests were made by Freyssinet of other subcontractors or of Karimbla in relation to safety matters, they were attended to in the majority of instances. There is ample reason to expect that if a request had been made of Karimbla to remedy the stairway, it would have been attended to. Practically every item in the Workplace Inspection Reports from 1 September 2014 to 2 February 2015 was attended to [132] . Furthermore, Mr Vieira said that if a contractor did not respond to a safety request it would be escalated by going to the builder (Karimbla) and then “he has got to do it” [133] . He added that if the issue of mid-rail on the stairway had been raised with Karimbla, “they would have done something about it” [134] . One would think this is especially so considering the extent to which the stairway was being used and the relatively simple task involved in remedying it. Simplicity of the task is demonstrated by the fact that it was remedied, albeit on the second attempt, after the incident and in very quick time. Alternative staircases were available to be used when the remedial work was being done and one was used.
	
	
	I do not think Freyssinet’s submission that staircases did not require mid-rails as a general practice is made good. When considering staircases of the nature of that involved in this case, the Standard required it and so did common sense. The evidence of Mr Smales does not support Freyssinet’s submission. In his evidence, he was talking about instances where work might be undertaken in a staircase area at the time or where the site was “organic” and changing day by day [135] . The stairway was in a static condition and had been for six months before the incident and no work was being done on it or near it.
	
	
	Freyssinet’s submission is that this request would have gone nowhere because it has not been established that had the request been made of Karimbla, it would have acted on it, or if it did, it would have carried out the task properly. As to the former, it was submitted that there were widespread failures before the incident with the absence of mid-rails, that this was an ongoing problem after the incident and that even as late as July 2015, Karimbla allowed stairways at the site without mid-rails. As to the latter, it was submitted that the first attempt by Karimbla to remedy the problem after the incident was an unsatisfactory attempt and it had to be re-done at the direction of Inspector Hill, thereby demonstrating that any request by Freyssinet was likely to be met with a result that was unsatisfactory and one that would not cure the problem.
	
	
	The evidence does not support Freyssinet’s submission.
	
	
	Inspector Hill’s evidence does not support missing mid-rails, except in one instance on 4 March 2015 [136] .
	
	
	Freyssinet’s submission relies in part on evidence of Mr Sykes. The parties debated whether his evidence supported widespread failures and ongoing problems with respect to absent mid-rails. I do not think it did, but it is not a matter of much moment. The critical question here is whether Karimbla would have responded appropriately on a request by Freyssinet to install adequate guardrailing. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it would have.
	
	
	Mr Vieira’s evidence referred to at [138] supports that Karimbla would have acted on a request to fix the problem.
	
	
	The evidence relating to the incident in July 2015, though after the incident, also supports that Karimbla would have acted on a request. What the evidence revealed about the occasion in July 2015 was that it occurred on 23 July 2015. It was an instance of no mid-rail on a stairway. The evidence went further. It was reported and remedied the same day [137] .
	
	
	Further, Exhibit PX 8 has seven Workplace Inspection Reports completed by Freyssinet from 2 March 2015 to 20 November 2015 covering a total of 26 varying items. All but three of them were attended to on the same day. One was attended to the following day [138] . The other two were noted as ‘ONGOING” and related to housekeeping and trip hazards. This supports the position that matters reported were attended to promptly.
	
	
	Freyssinet also relies on the evidence of Mr Reyes to support the submission that Karimbla did not adequately deal with safety issues across the site when matters were reported to them [139] . This evidence supports the fact that the same hazardous conditions could keep cropping up in workplace inspection reports [140] . It does not support the submission that the matters were not attended to by Karimbla when reported to it. His evidence further on was that Karimbla was very good at activating items and that to his knowledge all matters raised were attended to. [141] 
	
	
	Freyssinet also submitted that not all staircases have a mid-rail and whether there was one would depend on the type of posts. It was further submitted that Karimbla would not have installed a mid-rail if requested to do so by Freyssinet because the type of post installed would not support a mid-rail. The reference to the post is a reference to the pipe described in [14] above. There are several answers to that submission:
	



	
	an obligation to install a mid-rail, if such an obligation arises, cannot be overridden by the existence of a post that would not support a mid-rail;
	
	
	the evidence does not support the submission that the post would not support a mid-rail;
	
	
	even if it did, a mid-rail could be installed by installing a proper post;
	
	
	Karimbla, in fact, did install a mid-rail after the incident and did so in very quick time.
	



	
	Freyssinet knew from practice and experience on the site that safety matters could be and were raised with Karimbla and that Karimbla addressed them. It would have cost Freyssinet nothing to request Karimbla install adequate guardrailing. Karimbla could have and would have attended to the request in quick time with no disruption to the work schedule.
	
	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Freyssinet did fail in relation to the matter alleged in particular 6.c.
	


Particular 6.a.


	
	In particular 6.a., the prosecutor alleges Freyssinet failed by not:
	


“Instructing workers not to access stairways and steps at the site unless they were fitted with adequate edge protection;

(i)   and in particular instructing workers, including Mr Felemi, not to use the stairway until an intermediate rail was fitted, or until other suitable guarding was installed that removed or minimised the risk”.


	
	There was debate about the meaning of this particular. I do not consider that, on its proper reading, it required Freyssinet workers to undertake an inspection and examination of stairways and steps. The allegation here, on its proper reading, is that Freyssinet should have inspected and assessed whether stairways and steps had adequate edge protection and should have been aware that the stairway did not and should have instructed Mr Felemi not to use it until an intermediate rail was fitted or other suitable guarding was installed.
	
	
	Further, the particular is not to be read as contended for by Freyssinet as applying to all stairways and steps at the site as particular 6.b. does. It is to be read as applying to stairways and steps used by Freyssinet’s workers. This reading is also supported by particular 6.a.(i).
	
	
	There can have been no undue onus or hardship on Freyssinet in requiring it to determine if the stairway had adequate edge protection. It did not have that protection and, for reasons already given, Freyssinet should have been aware of that. In the circumstances, instructing Mr Felemi not to use the stairway was a step available to it and one that could and should have been taken.
	
	
	There was ample evidence that if a safety matter was not attended to, workers were not to go there, even ceasing work if need be. [142] 
	
	
	In this instance, Freyssinet instructing its workers not to use the stairway would not have resulted in work ceasing as there were other stairways available. Even if work did cease while adequate edge protection was put in place that would have been for a short time.
	
	
	In these circumstances, particularly if the step in particular 6.c. was not available, Freyssinet should have taken the step mentioned in particular 6.a.
	
	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Freyssinet failed in relation to the matter alleged in particular 6.a.
	
	
	For reasons given, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the fourth element of the charge ([29] above), namely that Freyssinet failed to comply with its duty under s 19(1) has been established.
	


Did Freyssinet’s failure expose Mr Felemi to risk of death or serious injury?


	
	The next element for consideration is whether Freyssinet’s failure exposed Mr Felemi to a risk of death or serious injury.
	
	
	There are two failures to consider here. They may be shortly described as the failure to request Karimbla to remedy the problem and the failure to direct its employees not to use the stairway until it was fixed.
	
	
	For reasons given, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that had the request particularised been made of Karimbla, Karimbla would have attended to it and installed adequate guardrailing.
	
	
	The very purpose of adequate edge protection is to stop personnel falling from the exposed edge. Had it been in place at the time of the incident on the stairway, it would have prevented Mr Felemi’s fall to the third or bottom landing. At the very least, it would have minimised the risk of that occurring. A mid-rail was a step Mr Reyes identified as a needed improvement and he thought a mid-rail “wouldn’t have gone astray” and would have addressed the risk [143] .
	
	
	Had the step in particular 6.a. been implemented by Freyssinet, the risk would have been avoided.
	
	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the fifth element of the charge ([29] above) namely that Freyssinet’s failure exposed an individual, Mr Felemi, to a risk of death or serious injury has been established.
	


Conclusion


	
	The elements of the offence have been proved beyond reasonable doubt against Freyssinet Australia Pty Ltd.
	
	
	I find Freyssinet Australia Pty Ltd guilty of the offence.
	
	
	I will list the matter for sentence on a date convenient to the parties.

		27 October 2017",2017-10-26 00:00:00,NSW District Court
6268047,R v Martin (No 9) [2017] NSWSC 1377,"Judgment


	
	On 5 October 2017 (the twenty-second day of the trial) the Crown sought to ventilate the admissibility of certain evidence to which the accused took objection. The evidence comprised of a number of photographs depicting a samurai sword (correctly called a katana) and various rulers demonstrating the dimensions of the weapon. Originally, the accused complained that there was an excessive number of photographs (19). [1]  The Crown then indicated that the exhibit had been culled down to 11 photographs. Having been shown the array of 11 photographs, the accused raised no objection to two photographs (numbered 1 and 2) depicting the length of the sword. The accused raised no objection to one of two photographs depicting the width of the blade at the hilt of the sword (photographs 3 and 4). The position seemed to be that one or other of the photographs was admissible but not both. It is clear that photograph 4 is merely designed to demonstrate where the measurement depicted in photograph 3 was taken. If one of the photographs is admitted, the other is clearly necessary for the jury to understand the location of the measurement. I indicated as much in argument and no further reasons are necessary.
	
	
	The bulk of the argument concerned the photographs numbered 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 16 and 17. These show the width of the blade at its tip and at various points along the blade. One complaint concerned the number of photographs – there were said to be too many. The Crown Prosecutor indicated that he could lead the evidence orally without tendering the photographs themselves. [2]  However, the more fundamental submission seemed to be that the measurements of the width of the tip was not relevant and may invite the jury to draw a connection between the measurements and part of the evidence given by a forensic pathologist that was admitted much earlier in the trial.
	
	
	At the conclusion of the argument I ruled as follows: [3] 
	


“I propose to allow at least some limited evidence of the width of the sword at the point because I think that at the moment the state of the evidence is unsatisfactory and was, or could potentially be, misleading in that there was an assumption made by the doctor which apparently was possibly incorrect. I will leave it to the parties to work out how that evidence is to be elicited and I will also leave it to the parties to see whether or not any witness and in particular Detective West and Dr Vuletic need to be recalled. But I will allow limited amount of evidence on the width of the sword that was purchased by the police.”


	
	The jury had taken an extended (1½ hour) lunch break to allow this issue (and two others) to be ventilated and I indicated that I would deliver fuller reasons in due course. [4]  These are those reasons.
	
	
	It is necessary to understand the context in which the objection was taken and the unsatisfactory way in which this issue arose. In spite of an invitation for any evidentiary issues to be resolved before the jury was empanelled, no such issues were identified. However, on the twelfth day of the trial, that is the day before the forensic pathologist was due to give evidence, objection was taken to her providing an opinion that “some or all of the wounds could have been inflicted by a samurai sword”. [5]  I allowed the evidence and delivered a short ex tempore judgment. [6] 
	
	
	The Crown alleges that the accused killed his father in the early hours of 13 June 2014 to obtain the proceeds of some insurance policies that were taken out earlier that year. The Crown will ask the jury to infer that the murder weapon was a katana. There is evidence that the accused was trained in the use of that weapon and purchased a katana from a martial arts instructor (Mr Friis) some time around 2007 or 2008 although the evidence is unclear on precisely when the katana was purchased. [7]  There is also evidence that in around 2012, the accused showed a neighbour (Ms Steffensen) a “samurai sword”. [8]  The police have been unable to locate the katana and there is evidence (also admitted over objection) from which the jury will be invited to infer that the accused was deliberately untruthful in relation to the whereabouts of the sword. [9] 
	
	
	The post mortem or autopsy report disclosed multiple wounds of two distinct types. First, there were a number of penetrating or stab wounds (where the depth of the wound is greater than its length on the skin surface). Second, there were a number of slashing or incised wounds (where the length of the wound on the skin surface is greater than its depth).
	
	
	Dr Vuletic originally provided a report in which she stated the opinion that the stab wounds “did not show any particular characteristics to indicate the nature of the implement used” and that “the wounds to the head were most likely caused by an axe”. [10]  There was an axe located at the scene with blood on it. It seems that the original police theory was that this axe was the murder weapon or at least one of the weapons used. Detectives later asked Dr Vuletic to amend her report and told her that investigating police had “determined” that the murder weapon was a samurai sword. [11]  The pathologist provided an amended report stating the opinion (referred to above) that “some or all of the wounds could have been inflicted by a samurai type sword”. [12]  The reference to the axe was removed, as was the sentence relating to the absence of “particular characteristics” in the wounds. In spite of these manifest deficiencies in this evidence, it was admitted over objection because the credibility of Dr Vuletic’s evidence, and the weight (if any) that should be given to her opinions, is a matter for the tribunal of fact (the jury) rather than for the trial judge. [13] 
	
	
	In the trial Dr Vuletic gave the following evidence concerning the wound she considered to be fatal: [14] 
	


“Q. Dealing firstly with number 7. Can we see that in photograph 34?

A. Yes.

Q. And 43?

A. Yes.

Q. And is it particularly the one that’s closest to the nipple?

A. That’s right.

Q. Could you describe that wound for us please?

A. This was a 2.2 centimetre long stab wound and by that I mean that was the length of the wound on the skin surface. It was located 3 centimetres lateral away from the left nipple. It was located taking a measurement from the heal, 136 centimetres from the heal, it entered into the left chest cavity between the 4th and 5th ribs creating a wound which was 3.5 centimetres long, then entered into the pericardial sack which is a connective tissue covering that covers the heart, created a 2.5 centimetre wound in the pericardial sack and then entered into the cut slicing right through the anterior wall of the heart.

Q. The anterior is the front?

A. The front yes.

Q. Front wall of the heart. Doctor can you comment that type of injury, whether it was necessarily fatal?

A. If one had immediate medical attention it is, or surgical attention it is possible that that might be survivable but it would need to very very rapid treatment so for practical purposes this was a fatal injury.

Q. Did you attribute that as the fatal injury?

A. I did.” [Emphasis added.]


	
	Later, the pathologist gave the following evidence as to the weapon that might have caused the wounds: [15] 
	


“CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour again I have two photographs that I will ask to be shown to the members of the jury and then marked for identification?

MFI #31 TWO PHOTOGRAPHS OF SAMURAI SWORD (AKA KATANA)

Q. Doctor can a sword of that nature firstly cause the penetrating stab wounds?

A. Yes I think it could.

Q. Are there any particular characteristics that lead you to that conclusion?

A. Well it appears to be sharp but what I don’t have are any measurements of it which is why I’m a little hesitant. I would need to know the width of the

blade.

Q. If you were to assume that the width of the blade is between 2.5 and 3.5 centimetres could that cause the injuries?

A. I think it’s possible but the wound, the fatal wound was 2.2 centimetres, it’s close to this width.

Q. Could a sword like that also be used to cause the incised or slice, slashing type injuries?

A. Yes.” [Emphasis added].


	
	I did not know then, and I do not know now, the basis upon which Dr Vuletic was asked “to assume that the width of the blade is between 2.5 and 3.5 centimetres.”
	
	
	The pathologist’s evidence was subject to a substantial attack in cross-examination as to the appropriateness of amending her report “to suit the police case”. [16]  At the end of the cross-examination, I asked some questions about the fatal wound and the assumed width of the blade of the katana: [17] 
	


“WENDLER: Yes thank you, I don’t have any more questions.

HIS HONOUR: Just bear with me for a moment.

Q. Doctor, you referred to one of the possibly fatal injuries being seven, eight and nine as being 2.2 I think centimetres?

A. Yes.

Q. And you were asked to assume by the Crown that the Samurai sword was 2.5 to 3.5 centimetres?

A. Yes.

Q. Does that not rule out the Samurai sword, at least one of that width as causing those injuries?

A. Well that was my reason for my hesitation.

Q. Well what you said I think was, “It was close”?

A. It was and we have to have to be sure whose measurements are right or accurate. When you are measuring the length of a wound on the skin because there is a degree of stretching of the skin, that is the - measurements on the skin are not totally accurate. I think that this could account for the discrepancy of .3 millimetre which is what it would be really between the knife.

Q. So .3 millimetres?

A. The sword .03 or 3 millimetres, .03 centimetres.

Q. Three millimetres is it?

A. Yes. It’s a small measurement.

Q. Three millimetres?

A. Yeah, but that’s not a lot. However, ultimately as I’m sure you know the pathology cannot confirm what weapon was used. That is science based on you know, DNA technology. The pathology alone can only give a guide as to the type of weapon used.

Q. When you did your first report were you aware that an axe had been found at the scene?

A. That's right, yes I was aware.

HER HONOUR: Mr Wendler, is there anything arising out of that?

WENDLER: No, thank you.”


	
	The pathologist was re-examined as follows: [18] 
	


“RE-EXAMINATION BY CROWN PROSECUTOR

Q. Doctor, I think you’ve just told his Honour that you were aware an axe had been found at the scene. Was there anything from your examination to indicate that the injuries were caused by an axe?

A. I don’t believe it’s possible to be certain looking at wounds they are caused by any particular weapon. I would not state on principle that a wound is caused by any particular weapon. I would only give an opinion, as I did, saying that they may have been consistent or were consistent with.

HIS HONOUR

Q. I thought you said they were most likely caused by an axe?

A. Or most likely were if that was--

Q. Can I be clear, is that what your first report said--

A. Yes.

Q. --that it most likely caused by an axe?

A. Because that was the information given to me.

CROWN PROSECUTOR

Q. Was there anything in the wound themselves that indicated characteristics of an axe?

A. No.

Q. Doctor, you’ve been asked about your second report. Are you suggesting the injuries were caused by a sword?

A. No. I have said they could have been.”


	
	The evidence of the sword’s actual dimensions only came into existence recently. That is, the measurements of the sword were made, and the photographs taken, after the pathologist gave evidence. [19]  No doubt it is calculated to correct the erroneous assumption that Dr Vuletic was asked to make in the course of her evidence in chief – that is, that the width of the katana was between 2.5 and 3.5 centimetres.
	
	
	The katana that was measured was one that was purchased by the police from Mr Friis. Mr Friis gave evidence that the sword sold to police was the same type of sword that was sold to the accused (“a practical katana from Hanwei”) and that “they haven’t changed the model on that practical katana, it’s still the same today”. [20]  It has not been suggested, in cross-examination or submissions, that the dimensions of the katana sold to police were different to the one sold to the accused.
	
	
	I am unable to accept the submission that evidence of the length of the katana and evidence of its width at the hilt is relevant and admissible but evidence of its width close to the tip is not. As I understood the submission, it was suggested that the evidence would create unfairness to the accused. The precise nature of the unfairness was articulated in argument as follows: [21] 
	


“WENDLER: As for the rest, I don’t understand what the relevance of the rest of the photographs are, the balance from there on. Now if it’s to suggest in some way that it can be linked to the evidence of Dr Vuletic, who did not have, other than a couple of photographs of the sword, and gave fairly rubbery evidence in relation to the implement that caused the wounds and the morphology of the wounds, I object to the balance of these photographs.

HIS HONOUR: Well I understand that, but what is the objection?

WENDLER: Well the relevance of them, I mean, alternatively, section 135 of the Evidence Act, or even 137. The evidence of - that’s if my friend is attempting to link the balance of these photographs somehow to the wounds, the depth and length of wounds, when the doctor’s evidence could not possibly come up to any association between these photographs and her evidence.”


	
	The Crown Prosecutor explained the relevance of the evidence as follows: [22] 
	


“Now the doctor’s evidence, as I understand it, was that it could’ve been caused by a blade that was 2.5, but this is a more accurate account of the actual sword that’s the police purchase, and therefore, in my submission, your Honour, and probative.”


	
	It was submitted in response: [23] 
	


“WENDLER: I don’t agree with that analysis because what this will do is invite the jury to look at these measurements and somehow align them or somehow infer from these measurements, particularly where we have got photographs of the tip of the katana, and somehow link up those measurements with the evidence of Dr Vuletic who said at page 715 of her evidence, line 17, well in fact on page 715, I asked her at line 5:

‘Q. Doctor you refer to one of the possible fatal injuries being 7, 8 and 9, as being 2.2, I think, centimetres and you were asked to assume by the Crown that the Samurai sword was 2.5 and 3.5?

A. Yes.

Q. Does that not rule out the Samurai sword at least what - at least one of that width as causing those injuries?

A. Well that was my reason for my hesitation.’

…

And she went on to say it was,

‘We have to be sure whose measurements are right or accurate when you’re measuring the length of a wound on the skin because there is a degree of stretching in the skin, that is, measurements on the skin are not totally accurate. I think that this could account for the discrepancy of point 3 millimetres which is what it would be really between, really between the knife’.

I mean the whole unsatisfactory nature really of her evidence aligned with this document which insinuates or invites the jury to look at these measurements and then, you know, to line them up with any evidence given by Dr Vuletic in relation to the wounds that she identified on the deceased.

I mean it’s, my friend says, ‘Well it is just a document you know for measurements’, well it’s going to have a force greater than that which the accused can’t control because of the way it is presented. I mean I have no objection to the ordinary evidence in relation to the length and the width of the katana but beyond that all these close up shots of the point of the katana and so on is capable of being misused by the jury.”


	
	Following these submissions, I asked counsel whether he might make submissions to the jury based on the erroneous assumption put to the doctor. The exchange was recorded as follows: [24] 
	


“HIS HONOUR: [I]s the accused going to go to the jury on the basis that the Samurai sword couldn’t have done these injuries because of the width and those questions that I asked at 715?

WENDLER: Well the accused case [is] he didn’t inflict any injury.

HIS HONOUR: Sure, that’s not what I asked you though.

WENDLER: No.”


	
	There was no further response to my inquiry as to the possibility of the defence making submissions on the basis of the size of the fatal wound and the erroneous assumption put to the doctor.
	
	
	The way this evidence was investigated and elicited is unfortunate (to say the least) in a number of respects. First, the circumstances in which the doctor came to provide an amended report, and change her opinion. Second, the failure of the investigators to measure the sword prior to the doctor providing an opinion or, at least, before she gave evidence in the trial. Third, the fact that the doctor was asked to give an opinion in evidence based on an erroneous assumption as to the dimensions of the sword. Even so, because of that erroneous assumption, the current state of the evidence is misleading. The Crown has made it clear that the evidence on this issue “goes no higher than that a sword of this nature could cause the injuries … this sword is not excluded as the type of sword that could cause the injuries”. [25]  He went to say:
	


“I would not suggest anything more than that the nature of the injuries are consistent with being caused by the sort of sword that the accused had.”


	
	As to this last submission, the pathologist did not give evidence that the injuries were “consistent with being caused by the sort of sword that the accused had”. [26]  As presently advised, I think that the highest the Crown can properly put any submission on this issue is that the opinion of the pathologist was that the type of sword owned by the accused “could” have caused the injuries and/or that the pathologist “thought” it was “possible”. [27]  However, if I have misunderstood the evidence and the Crown seeks to go further I will hear further submissions on the subject prior to counsel addressing the jury.
	
	
	The evidence was admissible because it corrected an erroneous assumption put to Dr Vuletic and eliminated or reduced the risk that the jury would be misled by evidence given on the basis of that assumption. The only relevant unfairness might arise from the fact that the evidence was tendered after the doctor and the seller of the sword gave their evidence. If there is any unfairness, it might readily have been cured by recalling any relevant witness for further cross-examination. [28]  No application to recall the doctor (or any other witness) was made. This is perhaps unsurprising given the substantial attack made on the credibility of her opinion.
	



	
	After I made the ruling referred to in paragraph [3] the evidence was elicited through Detective Edmonds and, with the exception of the two photographs (1 and 2) showing the length of the sword, [29]  the photographs were not tendered or admitted into evidence. The evidence of the measurements of the width of the sword was given orally. [30]

6268048,R v Nikolovski (No 2) [2017] NSWSC 1451,"EX TEMPORE Judgment


	
	HER HONOUR: At the conclusion of the Crown case in the trial of Jesse Nikolovski and Daniel Petryk, counsel for Mr Nikolovski makes application for a directed verdict with respect to count 1 on the indictment of 18 September 2017, that being the charge alleging that the accused murdered Robert Parry on 7 March 2015 at Wickham.
	
	
	The Crown opened its case against Mr Nikolovski to the jury on two bases, that of extended joint criminal enterprise and constructive murder. With respect to the former, the Crown case is there was a joint criminal enterprise between the accused men and Pheobe Bronner to rob Robert Parry when one of the group was armed with a dangerous weapon; and that during the course of the armed robbery, Mr Petryk discharged the gun, intending to cause really serious injury to Mr Parry, who died; that the discharge of the gun fell within the scope of the joint criminal enterprise; and that Mr Nikolovski contemplated that the gun could be used with that intention.
	
	
	The later, that is constructive murder, was advanced on a similar basis: that there was a joint criminal enterprise to rob Mr Parry whilst armed; that one of the participants, in this case, Mr Petryk, would be armed with a dangerous weapon; that Mr Petryk voluntarily discharged the firearm; and that the discharge of the gun by Mr Petryk was a contingency that Mr Nikolovski had in mind in joining and participating in the criminal enterprise to rob.
	
	
	The impression that I took from the Crown’s opening address was that the evidence would establish that Mr Nikolovski was aware that the .22 calibre rifle used to kill Mr Parry was in working order, and that Daniel Petryk had ammunition for it, from evidence that was to be led of a test firing of the gun and a telephone conversation about how to operate the firearm.
	
	
	The only evidence capable of establishing Mr Nikolovski’s liability for murder on either basis came from Pheobe Bronner. There is some other evidence suggesting his subsequent knowledge of the incident at Wickham, such as Exhibit AK and entries in Exhibit AF which record SMS exchanges between Ms Bronner and Mr Nikolovski on 10 June 2015, after the events recorded in Exhibit AG, but nothing beyond Pheobe Bronner to establish count 1.
	
	
	Ms Bronner’s evidence does not appear, by comparison with the Crown’s opening address, to have been given entirely as anticipated. As to the nature of the enterprise agreed between the accused men and Pheobe Bronner, Ms Bronner said this: she (and by implication, Mr Nikolovski) became aware that Daniel Petryk had a gun soon after he returned to the white sedan after it stopped at Mr Gorman’s back fence line, and after Mr Petryk got out of the car to collect something (T482:25). Daniel Petryk told them that he was aware of a house where his brother used to buy pot and where the door was always open. Daniel Petryk planned to sneak in and grab the pot (T484 – T485). The gun was to be used to “look scary” if an occupant was encountered (T485:22-29). At transcript 497, line 38, Ms Bronner confirmed that the plan agreed between the three was that “Daniel was going to sneak in and if there was no one around he was just going to grab the pot and if there was someone around we were just there to look like scary so he can take it”. She confirmed that they were there to just like look scary. When asked, “what were you going to scare them with” at the bottom of transcript 497, she said, “The weapons, like just to appear that way:” (T497:37 – T498:01).
	
	
	That evidence is capable of establishing a joint criminal enterprise to commit an offence of armed robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon. It may be that that evidence could (inferentially) establish liability on one or both bases if that was as far as it went. However, Ms Bronner went on to give evidence that her knowledge and that of Jesse Nikolovski as to the gun was that it was not loaded and that Daniel Petryk had no ammunition for it by the time they arrived at Wickham.
	
	
	The evidence from Ms Bronner was that Jesse Nikolovski did not want the gun in his car and so, after they were told it was not loaded, the gun was passed to Pheobe Bronner, who put it inside her clothing against her skin (T483:49 – T484:03). En route to Wickham the car stopped on what was referred to as a “really long road” that may have had trees along it. Contrary to the Crown’s opening as I understand it to be, Ms Bronner when asked said she had no recollection of any telephone calls being made by Daniel Petryk or anyone else at this time (T486:14). She said that Daniel Petryk got out of the car whilst she and Mr Nikolovski remained in the car arguing together. Ms Bronner said she heard a bang (T486:44). There was no evidence led about the nature of the sound or its volume. There was no evidence comparing that sound with the sound of the .22 rifle being discharged at Wickham. Ms Bronner said that when Mr Petryk got back into the car after the bang, there was no discussion about it (T487:30; T488:15).
	
	
	After hearing a bang and when all three were in the car, Ms Bronner put the gun inside her clothing next to her skin. She was specifically told that it was not loaded by Mr Petryk (T483:49 – T484:09). This conversation occurred in the confines of a car in circumstances where Jesse Nikolovski was said to be “freaking out” about a gun being in his car (T483:42) and was pacified to some extent by the gun being hidden by Ms Bronner. The inference is that he had heard the conversation about the gun not being loaded.
	
	
	The Crown returned to this issue before Ms Bronner completed her evidence, presumably in an attempt to lead the expected evidence. She repeated that the firearm was to be used just to look scary and (at T560:25), “he [he being Mr Petryk] wouldn’t use it”. When asked about bullets Ms Bronner said that Daniel only had one bullet.
	
	
	She was asked, “Any discussion about the bullets” and she said,
	


“When we were like unsure of like what the bang was, Daniel had said that he had one bullet. Another time I had assumed that that’s what the noise was but it obviously had one more bullet left” (T560:39).


	
	Whilst the transcript makes that comment sound a little confusing, my recollection of that evidence when it was given was a very clear impression that there had only been one bullet and that Ms Bronner at least understood that that bullet had been discharged with no further ammunition in Mr Petryk’s possession.
	
	
	There is however no evidence as to whether Mr Nikolovski had any knowledge of that particular conversation about the one bullet. It may be that, like Pheobe Bronner, he heard the comment about the one bullet and also assumed the bullet had been used, or it may be that he did not hear the conversation. The evidence is silent on that. However the evidence of Ms Bronner about the one bullet is interpreted, there is no evidence Mr Nikolovski knew anything about Daniel Petryk having one bullet or indeed any bullets at all.
	
	
	The matter was not cleared up by the Crown where there was a later attempt to get the missing evidence from Ms Bronner, at T574:14 – 15. She said “there was one bullet”, but again with nothing to link it to anything Mr Nikolovski may have known or understood.
	
	
	There was nothing to suggest Mr Nikolovski heard the conversation, other than the fact that it took place in the car at some unspecified point after the car had stopped on the long road and then continued on its journey.
	
	
	Again, if the evidence had gone no further than that, it may be that the Crown could make out its case on an inferential basis. But Ms Bronner again went further in her evidence. In cross-examination she returned to the subject of the firearm and whether it was loaded.
	
	
	At T592 she said Mr Nikolovski wanted nothing to do with the gun. She said at T592:35 that Daniel Petryk had said the gun was “safe and it wasn’t loaded”. Jesse Nikolovski was a party to this conversation and remained a party when Daniel Petryk said that the gun was not loaded and, further, that there was no ammunition (T593:24 – 27).
	
	
	The clear evidence that Jesse Nikolovski had proceeded with the enterprise to rob on the basis that the gun could not be discharged as a positive state of knowledge, is confirmed to a degree by Pheobe Bronner’s evidence that, after the event, that is the shooting at Wickham, there was an argument between Daniel Petryk and Jesse Nikolovski because “Daniel had said it wasn’t loaded” (T506:18).
	
	
	That last piece of evidence from Ms Bronner that the gun was not loaded and that there was no ammunition for it is the evidence which in my view leaves the Crown without a case for murder against Jesse Nikolovski on either basis.
	
	
	To make out murder on the basis of extended joint criminal enterprise the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that during the course of the armed robbery with the firearm, the gun discharged and that its discharge was both within the scope of the joint criminal enterprise, and that Mr Nikolovski contemplated that, in carrying out the enterprise, the gun might be used with the intention of causing grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	To make out constructive murder, the Crown would have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the discharge of the gun was a contingency or possibility that Jesse Nikolovski had in mind when joining or continuing in the enterprise to rob Mr Parry.
	
	
	The evidence, to the contrary, is that his participation was only after Daniel Petryk had told him and Pheobe Bronner that, not only was the gun not loaded, but there was no ammunition for it.
	
	
	I cannot in those circumstances conclude that there is any evidence upon which Mr Nikolovski could have contemplated that the discharge of the gun was a possibility.
	
	
	The Crown argues that taking the whole of the evidence together, the inference is available to be drawn that Mr Nikolovski did have sufficient information to contemplate the possibility that the gun would be used. The Crown has referred to the circumstances cumulatively including the journey to Mr Petryk’s house to collect him, the journey together to Mr Gorman’s house where something was collected by Mr Petryk, the direction by Mr Petryk of the car to a location at which it stopped and where having gotten out of the car, a bang could be heard, Mr Nikolovski’s knowledge of the presence a gun in the car, the discussion about bullets, and the discussion about what was planned to occur at Wickham.
	
	
	The Crown argues that the only inference that could be drawn on the basis of the whole of that evidence taken together, is an inference that there was a gun in the car to Mr Nikolovski’s knowledge which was in working order. The Crown further argues that in going to the premises of the person who sold drugs, the participants to the enterprise may well have concluded that it was necessary for them to have a weapon.
	
	
	The Crown says all of that evidence goes to establish that the accused Mr Nikolovski would have contemplated the possibility of the use of a gun.
	
	
	This is not a case, however, similar to that of Penza and Di Maria v R [2013] NSWCCA 21, where the robbers understood it was likely they would meet vigorous resistance from the drug dealer occupant and they may need to use a loaded firearm to enforce their will on the occupant or to protect themselves from resistance. Whilst Mr Parry was a supplier of cannabis on the evidence, the Crown was at pains to point out that he was a small time dealer who sold very small amounts to friends and family only. There could be no basis upon which the jury could infer that Jesse Nikolovski believed that resort might need to be had to the use of a firearm to effect the robbery.
	
	
	I have raised with counsel whether either is aware of any authority in which a person holding a positive state of knowledge that a firearm could not be discharged in circumstances such as those here, has nevertheless been held to be properly convicted of murder. Counsel are unaware of such a case and neither have I found any decision along those lines.
	
	
	If the evidence was simply that a firearm was to be taken to a robbery, even without evidence that Mr Nikolovski knew it was operational or knew that there was ammunition available for it, it may be that it would be sufficient for the jury to draw an inference and for the case to go to them for decision.
	
	
	Here, there is clear and uncontradicted evidence led from the Crown’s only relevant witness that Mr Nikolovski’s participation was on the basis of his knowledge that the gun was unloaded, that there was no ammunition for it, and therefore that it could not be discharged.
	
	
	In my view there is no evidence capable of establishing the relevant elements of murder based on either extended joint criminal enterprise or constructive murder. That being the case, the jury must be directed that a verdict of not guilty should be returned with respect to count 1. That is, there is a defect in the evidence such that taken at its highest; it simply will not sustain a verdict of guilty: Doney v R (1990) 171 CLR 207 at 214 to 215.

		25 October 2017",2017-10-08 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
6268049,R v Martin (No 10) [2017] NSWSC 1401,"EX TEMPORE Judgment (REVISED)


	
	Jessica Fallon has been called as a witness by the accused who is charged with attempted murder of his father (count 1) and causing grievous bodily harm to an Ed or Eddie Manning with intent (count 2) in April 2014, and with the murder of his father in June 2014 (count 3).
	
	
	The parties agreed that Ms Fallon should initially give evidence on the voir dire. She is represented by counsel today and her trial counsel has provided written submissions on the issue that arose today.
	
	
	Ms Fallon was called to give evidence on the voir dire, took an oath and, after one or two anodyne introductory questions, raised an objection to giving evidence. This objection had been foreshadowed by her legal team from an early stage of the proceedings. Ms Fallon relies on the privilege against self-incrimination, both at common law and under s 128 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).
	
	
	On the Crown case, Ms Fallon may have been involved in the attempted murder of Michael Martin Senior on 6 and 7 April 2017 and the infliction of grievous bodily harm of Mr Manning on the same date. The defence is running a positive case that Ms Fallon was involved in those offences. The Crown case is that if Ms Fallon was involved, she was involved along with the accused. The defence case is that Ms Fallon was involved, and was involved with other offenders, some of whom she may have nominated to police in the course of the police’s investigation.
	
	
	Both parties have, in the course of the first six weeks of the trial, elicited through various police officers, evidence of statements and admission made by Ms Fallon in which she said that she was involved in the April offences.
	
	
	Initially, the prosecutor objected to the accused adducing the hearsay evidence of Ms Fallon’s admissions on the basis that it had not been established that Ms Fallon was “unavailable” to give evidence. That is, the accused had not established that “all reasonable steps [had] been taken …to find [Ms Fallon] or secure her attendance” or that “all reasonable steps [had] been taken to compel [Ms Fallon] to give the evidence, but without success.” [1] 
	
	
	That prompted the accused to issue a subpoena and to seek short service. The subpoena was served upon Ms Fallon, who dutifully appeared in court, represented by counsel, and indicated that she would object to giving evidence in the trial. She was subsequently arrested for unrelated matters and appeared here today in custody.
	
	
	In any event, after the accused had taken the steps to compel her attendance and [now] to compel her to give evidence, the prosecution withdrew its objection to the hearsay evidence.
	
	
	Ms Fallon stands charged with the two April offences and is due to stand trial in the District Court of New South Wales next year. Having considered the information provided to me, and with the concurrence of counsel appearing in the trial, I formed the view that Ms Fallon’s objection was based on reasonable grounds and so I ruled pursuant to s 128(2) of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	I then heard from each counsel as to whether it was in “the interests of justice” to direct her to give evidence, with or without the benefit of a certificate under s 128 of the Evidence Act. None of the three counsel who made submissions urged a submission that it was in the interests of justice to direct her to give evidence. Nevertheless, it is a matter upon which I must reach a decision and I adjourned very briefly to consider the submissions, the evidence and the importance of Ms Fallon’s evidence in the trial.
	
	
	Ultimately, I accept the joint position put by counsel that it is not in the interests of justice to direct Ms Fallon to give evidence, with or without a certificate that her evidence could not be used against her in future proceedings. I have reached that acceptance, in brief terms, for the following reasons.
	
	
	First and most important, to require her to give evidence would “fundamentally alter the accusatorial judicial process” concerning her trial proceedings. [2]  I agree with the statement made in Odgers Uniform Evidence Law: [3] 
	


“If the witness is a defendant in pending criminal proceedings, it would be most unlikely that the interests of justice would require the witness to give evidence.”


	
	The learned author goes on to cite the now famous passage of Hayne and Bell JJ from X7 v Australian Crime Commission. Mr Odgers statement is not, and cannot be, an absolute proposition and each future case of similar kind will have to be considered on its own facts and merits. [4]  But I think Mr Odgers’ general proposition is a reasonable point from which to commence.
	
	
	Second, extremely experienced counsel for the accused Mr Martin, has expressed concern that if Ms Fallon is called before the jury she may refuse to co-operate and the impression may be gained by the jury that she is attempting to assist the accused in some way. This would, as Mr Wendler submits, have a capacity to prejudice Mr Martin’s right to a fair trial.
	
	
	Third, the Crown has indicated that it will not seek a warning under s 165 that her hearsay evidence or admissions may be unreliable, although no doubt submissions will be made by the Crown that they (or some of them) are unreliable. However, no direction or warning will be sought and this means that the accused will not be disadvantaged forensically in his attempt to rely on the out of court statements of Ms Fallon. (I would indicate that, even if application was made for a s 165 warning, there are “good reasons for not” giving a warning, [5]  those reasons being that the accused has taken steps to require the witness to give evidence, notwithstanding the position it ultimately takes (and takes very responsibly) on the question of the interests of justice.
	
	
	Fourth, the Crown has indicated that there may be steps that could essentially quarantine the evidence given by Ms Fallon, so that the prosecution and investigating police with carriage of her trial would not know the content of her evidence. However, those steps themselves are undesirable and expensive and, even if taken, there is always a risk or, at least, the perception of a risk that those involved in the prosecution or investigation of both Mr Martin and Ms Fallon will be aware of evidence that she has given or that there may have been some derivative use of that evidence. [6]  The situation is that the Crown Prosecutor who appears in the present trial is also briefed to appear in Ms Fallon’s trial. The investigators who have conducted the investigation into the accused’s alleged involvement are also common investigators to the Fallon case. That is why I say that the steps that would need to be taken to attempt to quarantine the evidence are themselves undesirable and tend towards a finding that it is not in the interests of justice.
	
	
	Fifth, there is evidence before me, both in the form of statements made by her Honour Adamson J in granting Ms Fallon bail, and also in the written submissions prepared by Ms Fallon’s trial counsel, in which the opinions of a Dr Olav Nielssen are quoted. His opinions suggest that Ms Fallon has various difficulties, which I will not embarrass her by going into, but they are psychological in nature so as to justify the submission (and my finding) that she is a vulnerable person [7]  and a person who should not be compelled to give evidence when her trial is pending unless there are genuinely compelling reasons.
	
	
	That same body of evidence and material gives rise to the sixth reason, which is that the psychiatric material raises the possibility that any evidence Ms Fallon may give in the trial, particularly if she is compelled to give it over her objection, and even with the benefit of a certificate, may be quite unreliable. Mr Odgers refers to that as a relevant factor. [8]  It is also one of the factors that motivated Judge Norrish QC to refuse to issue a certificate in a trial conducted in the District Court. [9] 
	
	
	The seventh reason is that neither party in the current trial urges me to direct Ms Fallon to give evidence. Neither suggests that they cannot have a fair trial in the absence of her giving evidence. Each has sufficient evidence in the form of the hearsay or admissions that have been elicited through the police sfficers to go to the jury and to put their case fairly and squarely. The accused will rely on her admissions of being involved and the lack of any evidence whatsoever to connect Mr Martin with Ms Fallon, and the Crown will rely on the evidence it suggests that at least some of Ms Fallon’s statements to the police, and in particular statements as to who she was associated with if and when she committed the crimes, are provably and demonstrably and palpably false.
	
	
	The eighth and final matter (which I have added since delivering this judgment ex tempore) is that the terms of the statute provide a relatively high hurdle before a witness should be required to give evidence over a valid objection based on the right against self-incrimination. The test is whether the interest of justices “requires” (“as opposed to a less demanding term like ‘favour’”). [10] 
	
	
	I have, of course, considered the countervailing matters militating in favour of compelling Ms Fallon to give evidence. These include the seriousness of the allegations against Mr Martin, the prominence that Ms Fallon’s admissions have taken in the course of the proceedings, and the consequent potential that her evidence may be of real importance in the trial of the present accused.
	
	
	But even considering those matters, overwhelmingly the relevant factors lead to a conclusion that the interests of justice do not require an order that this young woman be directed or required to give evidence in Mr Martin’s trial.
	
	
	Accordingly, I decline to make an order under s 128(4) of the Evidence Act requiring her to give evidence.

		27 October 2017",2017-10-10 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
6268096,R v Martin (No 7) [2017] NSWSC 1353,"Judgment


	
	The accused is charged with attempted murder of his father on 6-7 April 2014, inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent on his father’s flat mate (Mr Manning) on the same day and with murdering his father on 13 June 2014. The brief facts are set out in other interlocutory judgments and rulings on evidence. [1]  This judgment relates to evidence the Crown seeks to lead in proof of the April offences.
	
	
	The accused objects to the Crown leading evidence of part of a telephone call between the accused and his wife (“Candace”) recorded by police on 1 April 2015. [2]  In that call Candace made reference to “that woman” and the accused said:
	


“But remember I had long hair and now it’s short. She wouldn’t know which, what I looked like. The police have all our bank records and all our phone records, they can’t link us to her, so don’t worry about that.

…

That that if anything goes in our favour. Um, but yeah look, the police really don’t have anything of substantial, you know. All the things that they said to me, they showed me photos of the scene and everything and nothing of it is, you know, so it’ll be interesting to see the brief. But don’t worry about her or anything, ‘cause I don’t know if they’ve heard, but the word coming out of um, Grafton is ha, ha the son’s going down for murder, so obviously she’s opened her mouth. So, but um, yeah.”


	
	The Crown only presses the first paragraph set out above. The second paragraph was tendered on the voir dire to establish the identity of the person referred to as “her” and “that woman” in the conversation.
	
	
	The accused acknowledges the reference to “that woman” and the accused’s comments that follow relate to a co-accused Jessica Honey Fallon who was in custody charged with the attempted murder of the accused’s father. Ms Fallon is to stand trial in the District Court next year. The accused has issued a subpoena requiring her to give evidence in his case in the present trial. She has indicated through her lawyers that she objects to giving evidence and will claim privilege against self-incrimination. The accused was also charged with the attempted murder, as well as with the murder of his father on 13 June 2014. There is no suggestion, at least on the Crown case as I understand it, that Ms Fallon was involved in the murder.
	
	
	The accused submits that the evidence has a capacity to mislead or confuse the jury and that the probative value of the evidence is slight and is outweighed by its potential for unfair prejudice. Further, the accused submits that the Crown is attempting to change its case to one of joint criminal enterprise (between the accused and Ms Fallon) whereas its case has, to this point, been that the accused is liable as a principal present at the scene and directly responsible for the injuries to his father (and a second victim Mr Manning).
	
	
	I am unable to accept either of these submissions. The evidence is admissible.
	
	
	The accused tendered telephone intercepts between himself and his half-brother, Mitchell. [3]  These occurred on 24 February 2015, shortly after Ms Fallon’s arrest. The purpose of this tender was to show that the accused and other members of his family had an obvious, and innocent, interest in the arrest of one of the people that the police believed was responsible for the crimes committed against their father. This innocent interest reduced the probative value of the ‘phone call on 1 April 2015. Accordingly, so the submission went, the things the accused said to his wife could not properly be put to the jury as an admission of guilt or as evidence suggesting that he had a consciousness of guilt.
	
	
	While it was not articulated, it might also be said that the accused knew (or must have known) that the call was being recorded. The first words recorded in the telephone intercept was a warning or notification that the call would be recorded:
	


“You are about to receive a phone call from an inmate at Cessnock Correctional Centre. Your conversation will be recorded and may be monitored. If you do not wish to receive this call, please hang up now. Go ahead please.”


	
	In those circumstances, it might be thought to be unlikely that the accused would be foolish enough to say anything that might constitute an admission or demonstrate a consciousness of guilt. Rather, the more natural inference might be that the accused was merely discussing the evidence the police were gathering in an attempt to prove a false allegation against him.
	
	
	The accused asserts an alibi in respect of the attempted murder of his father. He says that he was at home at Esk in Queensland at the time. He relies on a transaction at a service station in a town near Esk and has cross-examined various witnesses to the effect that he may have been visiting a work site in the early hours of the morning. He also cross-examined into evidence a great deal of material to establish that Ms Fallon was a participant in the attack along with others. He has established, or attempted to establish, that there were other people in the community (including bikies and drug dealers) who had a motive to bring harm to his father. The material he elicited in cross-examination includes extensive admissions by Ms Fallon in which she nominates herself and two others as being responsible for the attempted murder.
	
	
	I accept that there are innocent inferences available to the jury and that the jury might find that the conversation with his wife was an entirely innocent one. However, what inferences should be drawn from the direct evidence of what the accused said to his wife is a matter for the tribunal of fact to determine. It is a not a matter that would ordinarily lead to the exclusion of the evidence.
	
	
	In light of the manner in which the case is being run – that is, the accused is running a positive case that Ms Fallon and some of her associates committed the April attack – the evidence of the accused’s conversation with his wife, particularly his reference to his change of appearance and the absence of any provable link between him and Ms Fallon, is capable of affecting the jury’s assessment of a fact in issue. I can see no unfair prejudice in the admission of the evidence. Nor is the evidence is misleading or confusing. The jury will be directed that it can only draw a guilty inference if it is the only reasonable inference to draw in the circumstances.
	
	
	There is no real substance to the submission that the prosecution is changing its case. Mr Wendler took me to a number of passages in the Crown’s opening in order to substantiate this submission. It is clear that the Crown case was, and remains, that the accused was present at the scene and participated in the attack on his father and Mr Manning. The Crown in its opening, and in answer to a question from me in the course of the trial, has eschewed any reliance on joint criminal enterprise in respect of the attempt murder. [4]  Unless it disproves the accused’s alibi beyond reasonable doubt, the prosecution case must fail. Further, it must prove that the accused was present and participated in the attack. However, the Crown has never asserted that the accused acted alone and specifically referred to Ms Fallon as a person he may have enlisted to assist him. In his opening, the Crown Prosecutor said this: [5] 
	


“…it may well be that in the end you come to the conclusion that there were other people involved. In that context you may hear reference to a young woman called Jessica Fallon. But in this trial, the Crown is setting out to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that this accused was involved in the attack. It may be in the end that you think that the accused enlisted others to help him, but, as I say, in this trial the Crown sets out to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that this accused was involved.”


	
	Contrary to the accused’s submission, there is no unfairness in the prosecution attempting to lead this evidence arising from the way it has run its case to this point. Mr Wendler submitted:
	


“…it’s never been, certainly not openly suggested that he had recruited and formed a plan with Jessica Fallon in relation to the activity on 7 April.

…

What my friend’s seeking to do now is suggest that Fallon was one of those people actively involved, when that, I don’t think, is the centrepiece of his case”. [6] 


	
	Contrary to this submission, what the Crown is doing – and what it did in opening the case – is to leave open the possibility that Ms Fallon was involved and that the accused recruited her to be involved, without seeking to prove its case by means of a joint criminal enterprise between the two or by reference to accessorial liability. The Crown asserts, and the Crown must prove, that the accused was present and participated in the violent events of 7 April 2014. Whether somebody else was present, and whether that somebody else was Ms Fallon, is not something the Crown seeks to, or needs to, establish.
	



	
	For those reasons, the evidence in the impugned passage of the telephone intercept of 1 April 2015 is admissible.

		27 October 2017",2017-10-02 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
6268098,R v Martin (No 8) [2017] NSWSC 1355,"Judgment


	
	The accused objects to the prosecution adducing evidence of certain answers he gave to investigating police in the course of a lengthy interview with police on 23 April 2015. The Crown says that the answers constitute lies capable of demonstrating a consciousness of guilt. The accused submits that the evidence is unfairly prejudicial because it will either disclose that he committed (or was alleged to have committed) another, unrelated, offence or that the evidence will invite speculation on the part of the jury. The Crown says that the evidence can be elicited in such a way that will minimise the possible prejudice and that any potential for prejudice can be cured by direction.
	
	
	The Crown case is that the accused murdered his father in the early morning of Friday 13 June 2014. The Crown will invite the jury to infer that he did so by using a samurai sword (“katana”). There is evidence that the accused purchased such a sword from an instructor, Mr Friis, although the evidence is not clear as to precisely when the sword was purchased. There is also evidence that the accused was trained in martial arts including in the use of the weapon and that he was proficient in the use of the weapon. [1]  One of his neighbours gave evidence that he showed her a samurai sword in 2012. As I understand it, the evidence will be that the police were unable to locate the sword in the course of their investigations in 2014 and 2015.
	
	
	The impugned evidence concerns answers the accused gave as to the whereabouts of the katana. He told the investigators that Queensland police took the sword from him in the course of investigating an allegation that he used the sword to threaten somebody “in about 2007” (“the Queensland incident”). The Crown is in a position to call evidence from a Queensland police officer who will assert that he investigated the Queensland incident and did not seize the sword.
	
	
	The accused’s case in the present trial is that he was a victim of a home invasion during which unknown assailants tied him up with tape and killed his father. A neighbour found the accused tied up and crying for help. He had a number of injuries. He was interviewed at the scene (as a victim) and shortly thereafter provided a statement to police (as a victim). He became a suspect some time later. He was interviewed as a person of interest on 14 March 2015 [2]  and again, after his arrest, on 23 April 2015. [3] 
	
	
	The Crown referred to a very small portion of the first interview in which the accused was asked about an incident “in about 2007” when the accused allegedly “threatened someone with a Samurai sword”. He told police that he did “lose it then” and threatened a person who was “aggravating us constantly” and “starting problems”. He said that “it went through court” but there was “no conviction” and that he then “got rid of all me weapons”. [4]  The Crown does not intend to lead any details of the incident or these answers except to put into context answers given in the later interview. The passage of the later interview is at QQ 563-564:
	


Q 563   OK. She also said in recordings, which we made about her, that a sword was used to murder your father on the 13th June, 2014. What can you tell me about that.

A.   I don’t have a sword.

Q 564.   Michael, we had an interview prior to your arrest where we spoke about an incident where you were charged in Queensland in relation to using a Samurai Sword on someone?

A.   Police had that, they took it.


	
	The Crown does not propose to lead the question in Q 563 (or the whole of 564) but seeks to rely on the answer “I don’t have a sword” and the explanation “Police had that, they took it.” The Crown submits that the jury would be entitled to find that those answers constituted lies in relation to a material issue and that the jury would be entitled to infer that the lies demonstrated a consciousness of guilt. The Crown says that any prejudice could be reduced by the manner in which the evidence is elicited and by a direction to the jury as to the limited use to which the evidence can properly be put.
	
	
	Mr Wendler submits that the evidence is unfairly prejudicial and that the degree of prejudice is high. The accused will be placed in a position in which he will be required to disclose the fact of a previous offence in circumstances where he has not raised character and where such evidence would not otherwise be admissible. The evidence would invite tendency reasoning even though the Crown specifically eschews reliance on the Queensland incident as demonstrating any relevant tendency. Alternatively, Mr Wendler says that the state of the evidence would be so vague or opaque that the jury would inevitably speculate as to what happened in the Queensland incident. As counsel put the submission: [5] 
	


“I mean it just becomes completely artificial. The accused cannot

explain in his case the existence of this sword otherwise than by explaining the incident in Queensland that is a previous criminal prosecution in 2008. And the whole exercise just becomes contrived and invites, and has potential to invite the jury to reason in a propensity way. In other words because he’s had some association, or been interviewed about a sword some years earlier therefore he’s someone who - they would just speculate, it opens for speculation as to what his involvement with this sword was.”


	
	As to the answer to Q 564 (“Police had that, they took it”), Mr Wendler submitted (on instructions) that this was a reference to a different weapon. Asked whether the answer at Q 564 was conceded to be a lie, Mr Wendler said: [6] 
	


“No. No, I’m instructed that he answered that question on his best memory that he did take it and I’m instructed that he in fact had two swords and the one that he remembers he thought the police took, as a memory, was the sword that was purchased from Mr Friis.

HIS HONOUR: Is it capable of being categorised by the Crown as a lie?

WENDLER: Well it’s, on the Crown case, it’s suggested it’s a lie that they took it, I mean it an issue really solely going only to credit.”


	
	One difficulty in determining this objection is that not all of the material concerning the Queensland incident is available because it was not tendered on the voir dire. (This is not to suggest that it should have been.) For example, the police asked the accused about an incident in “about 2007” whereas the argument proceeded on the basis that the incident occurred in 2008. [7]  This has some significance because the evidence is that the accused stopped training in Zen Do Kai in 2008. [8]  I assume he purchased the katana before that, but there is no evidence as to precisely when the sword was acquired. Another area where the information before the Court is a little vague (or, perhaps, unlikely) is that the accused told police that no conviction was recorded in relation to the Queensland incident. [9]  This was confirmed in the course of submissions, although it was put in argument (on instructions) that he “was fined but no conviction was recorded.” [10]  The Crown did not gainsay this assertion although, in New South Wales at least, it is an unlikely outcome. That is, there is no power in a sentencing court (in New South Wales) to impose a fine if no conviction is recorded. (After publishing a draft of this judgment, I was advised by the Crown Prosecutor that such an outcome is possible in Queensland.) A further area of uncertainty is that the accused told police that the “victim” of the Queensland incident was “aggravating us.” In argument, it was put that the victim was bullying another person and the accused intervened. [11]  The basis (or facts) upon which the matter proceeded in Queensland is not known but the Crown did not contradict the matters put by the accused in argument (or in the interview).
	
	
	Each of the matters referred to in the last paragraph has some capacity to impact on the degree of prejudice that would be suffered if the evidence is admitted. If the accused was defending somebody who was being bullied and if no conviction was recorded against him, the degree of prejudice would be reduced. The evidence could be elicited, and cross-examined upon, in such a way that would not cause very much prejudice at all. Any prejudice could be cured by direction. On the other hand, if there was some factual dispute as to the basis of the sentencing hearing or if the prosecution sought to refute the assertion that no conviction was recorded, there is a risk that there would be a “trial within the trial” and the jury would be confronted with the possibility of (or a suggestion that) the Crown is asserting that the accused told a lie upon the original (alleged) lie.
	
	
	The objection was based on s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). In the alternative, reliance was placed on s 135. Those sections provide:
	


135 General discretion to exclude evidence

The court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might:

(a) be unfairly prejudicial to a party, or

(b) be misleading or confusing, or

(c) cause or result in undue waste of time.

…

137 Exclusion of prejudicial evidence in criminal proceedings 

In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.


	
	There is clearly a risk of prejudice in admitting evidence that the police investigated the accused in relation to a previous criminal use of a katana or similar weapon. However, evidence that an accused person has previously been charged or convicted for a crime is not per se inadmissible. The question has always been and – subject to the provision in s 97 of the Evidence Act (tendency evidence) upon which the Crown does not here rely – the question remains whether the evidence is probative beyond the suggestion that the accused has a propensity to commit crime, or the type of crime under consideration. This was said as long ago as Makin’s case [12]  where Lord Herschell made the following observation at 65:
	


“It is undoubtedly not competent for the prosecution to adduce evidence tending to shew that the accused has been guilty of criminal acts other than those covered by the indictment for the purpose of leading to the conclusion that the accused is a person likely from his criminal conduct or character to have committed the offence for which he is being tried. On the other hand, the mere fact that the evidence adduced tends to shew the commission of other crimes does not render it inadmissible if it be relevant to an issue before the jury…”


	
	This passage has stood the test of time. [13]  Even so, it is always incumbent on the trial judge to determine whether the evidence should be excluded (previously at common law, and now under ss 135 and 137 Evidence Act) following an assessment of the probative value and prejudicial impact of the evidence.
	
	
	In each case, it is necessary to make an assessment of the probative value of the evidence. In the context of the allegations, including the suggestion that the accused killed his father by using a katana, a false denial by the accused that he owned such a weapon, or a false assertion that the police took it from him some years before the offence, is evidence capable of establishing a consciousness of guilt. Whether there is another explanation – that he made a mistake due to the passage of time or that he was talking about a different sword – is a matter for the jury to determine. While clear directions must be provided to the jury as to the use of the evidence and the possible danger in its use, I assess the probative value of the evidence to be reasonably high.
	
	
	As I have acknowledged, there is always potential for prejudice in the admission of such evidence. However, I doubt that the jury would reason to guilt in the present case on the basis of the relatively minor allegation that the accused faced in Queensland. Further, based on the conduct of the voir dire, there are a number of measures that can be taken to reduce the danger of unfair prejudice.
	
	
	First, the evidence can be elicited in such a way to make it clear to the jury that there was no allegation or suggestion that the accused physically used the weapon to strike, or attempt to strike, any person. Second, the jury can be informed that the accused was provoked, or that he came to the aid of a third party who was being bullied (assuming that is the fact). Third, the evidence adduced may include the fact that no conviction was recorded against the accused or, if that is not the case, that the accusation was a minor one and that the accused was fined with no other penalty. In view of the absence of any contest as to those issues on the voir dire, it is assumed such material will be adduced in chief, or in cross-examination, or by means of an agreed fact. If these matters were elicited in cross-examination or if evidence was led in the accused’s case, considerations of fairness would disentitle the Crown from rebutting those assertions unless the matter is raised prior to the evidence subject of the present objection being adduced before the jury.
	
	
	Finally, the jury can be directed as to the limited use to which the evidence can be put. Specifically, the jury could receive a firm warning against reasoning that the accused is more likely to be guilty merely because he was the subject of a police investigation (or a charge) concerning a relatively minor incident several years ago. The jury would be directed that the evidence is only relevant to the Crown’s allegation that the accused used a katana to carry out the murder offence, attempts by police to locate that weapon and the accused’s response to that part of the investigation. Such directions can be given when the evidence is adduced and repeated in the summing up.
	
	
	The summing up would also include directions as to the way in which lies can be used and the caution with which such evidence must be approached. If the accused requested it, some direction on this subject could be provided when the evidence is elicited but my inclination, in the absence of such a request, would be to provide all directions as to lies in the course of the summing up.
	
	
	I should say that, as the matter currently stands, I am unable to accept the submission that the lie (assuming the jury found it to be a deliberate untruth) would only be relevant to an assessment of the accused’s credibility. In my view, on the evidence currently before me in the trial and on the voir dire, the answers related to a material issue and it would be open to the jury to find that the accused attempted to distance himself from the weapon in an attempt to exculpate himself from the crime. Whether the jury draws that conclusion will be a matter for it, and its members, in the light of all of the evidence and the directions it receives as to the caution with which such evidence must be approached. Even if it were only relevant to the credibility of the accused, the probative value of the evidence remains high because the accused’s account to police must be disproved beyond reasonable doubt for the Crown to have any hope in establishing the charge of murder.
	
	
	Having considered these matters I have concluded that the probative value of the evidence is not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice (s 137). Similarly, I am not persuaded that the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial, misleading or confusing or result in an undue waste of time (s 135).
	
	
	Subject to the concessions made by the Crown as to the manner in which the evidence will be adduced, and to the contents of this judgment, the evidence is admissible.

		27 October 2017",2017-10-02 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
6268100,R v Martin (No 6) [2017] NSWSC 1344,"Judgment


	
	The Crown sought to elicit certain evidence, and to invite the jury to do certain things, that are said to be relevant to the question of the credibility of the accused’s version of the events surrounding his father’s murder. Mr Wendler, who appears for the accused, raised objection to each aspect of the Crown’s proposed presentation. The argument took place on 25 September 2017 and, to enable the parties to prepare for the final week of the prosecution case, I announced my orders and rulings on 29 September 2017. I upheld the objection in respect of each piece of evidence and each part of the prosecution’s proposed presentation and indicated that I would provide reasons later. These are my reasons.
	
	
	The Crown case is that the accused attempted to murder his father in April 2014 in the father’s flat in Murwillumbah. His father was left with serious injuries but survived. The accused has, or asserts, an alibi for the date and time of that offence.
	
	
	After the April incident, the deceased was in a hospital for a period and was then cared for by a former girlfriend in the area of the Glasshouse Mountains. Once that situation became untenable the accused undertook to look after his father. A couple of days later, on 12 June 2014, the pair travelled together from the accused’s home in Esk to the flat in Murwillumbah where the offence occurred in April. The Crown case is that the accused murdered his father in the early hours of the following morning. The Crown relies on a number of pieces of circumstantial evidence including (but not limited to) the accused taking out insurance policies on his father’s life in February 2014, the accused’s expressing hatred of his father, the accused’s geographical proximity to the events, a letter containing what the Crown asserts is an admission, the accused’s training in martial arts and ownership of a sword capable of inflicting the types of injuries that killed the deceased.
	
	
	The accused’s case is that he was the victim of the same crime that resulted in his father’s death. He says that unknown criminals, perhaps the same people who committed the April offence, invaded his father’s home while he was sleeping. The intruders hit him in the head, threatened to kill him, bound him with tape and left him in the bathroom of the premises. They then murdered his father. There is evidence in the trial that the deceased was involved in some way with outlaw motorcycle gangs and drug dealing and evidence from which an inference might be drawn that certain unsavoury characters may have had a motive to do him harm.
	
	
	A local resident (Mr Collingwood) found the accused, making muffled cries for help, at about 5am on Friday 13 June 2014. He was at the foot of the stairs that lead up to the flat where the crimes were committed. He was bound with black tape. Mr Collingwood unbound him. After discovering the dead body of the accused’s father, emergency services were called. An ambulance arrived first and police arrived a short time later. A crime scene was established and police collected the lengths of black tape with which the accused was bound.
	
	
	The current evidentiary and forensic controversy concerns the nature and properties of that black tape. The Crown case is that the accused staged his own assault. It seeks to establish that the accused’s account lacks credibility. One aspect of that concerns the nature of the black tape. The Crown will attempt to prove that the kind of tape in which the accused was discovered bound up was easy to tear and that the accused could easily have broken free of his bindings soon after the intruders left the premises.
	
	
	The Crown seeks to do three things, identified in argument as follows: [1] 
	


“Your Honour I am happy to indicate that what I’m proposing to do in relation to that evidence is in essence threefold. There are three things that I would be asking the Court to do in relation to the gaffer tape, your Honour understanding that a roll of the tape has been tendered to the court.

Your Honour firstly is to admit into evidence oral evidence of Detective Edmonds being bound with the tape, and his description of that experience, and the ease with which he was able to burst free of the tape. As a part of that I would ask the Court to accept into evidence a video of that process.

The second thing I would be asking to do is that during the evidence of Detective Edmonds I would ask that tape be applied to his hands and wrists and ask him to demonstrate if it can be torn.

The third is to invite the jury to examine lengths of tape in court, so that would involve peeling off a length of tape for each member of the jury if they wished, so that they can examine the tape in terms of its, if there’s a more technical term, stickiness, adhesive ability I suppose, and invite them to see how easily it tears.”


	
	Counsel for the accused submits that the proposed evidence and presentation has the capacity to be misleading and unfairly prejudicial. In particular, the video demonstration of Detective Edmonds escaping from his binds is artificial and fails to replicate the circumstances in which the accused found himself on the morning of his father’s murder. Based on the evidence available to the Court, it cannot be determined how closely the accused was bound or the number of times the tape was wrapped around itself. Further, the demonstration fails to take account of the particular circumstances in which the accused found himself and, specifically, the fact that he had been struck in the head and was in a state of distress and panic after hearing his father assaulted (possibly murdered) by the intruders. At its high point, counsel submitted that the demonstration was so far removed from the true circumstances as described by the accused (and Mr Collingwood) that the evidence was not relevant. That is, it had no capacity rationally to affect an assessment of a fact in issue. As to the proposed invitation to the jury to conduct experiments with the tape in the jury box, Mr Wendler submitted that there was a risk that there would be a tacit invitation for the jury to take on the role of investigators or detectives rather than fact finders. An initial submission that the failure to obtain an order under s 53 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) rendered the recording of Detective Edmonds “bursting free from the tape” was not pressed.
	
	
	The Crown submits the evidence is relevant. A critical fact in issue is the credibility of the accused’s account to police, an account upon which he continues to rely on in his defence to the charge of murder. If the tape was of such a nature that the accused could easily have broken free, the suggestion that he staged his own assault gains force. Accordingly, evidence going to the ease with which the tape might be torn or broken has a capacity rationally to affect a fact in issue. I accepted this submission.
	
	
	The Crown went on to submit that the evidence and demonstrations are not misleading and the jury can be directed as to any deficiencies in the evidence.
	
	
	A deal of evidence adduced in the trial prior to the voir dire on this issue is relevant to the question currently under consideration. Without attempting to be exhaustive, this includes:
	



	
	Documents showing a transaction on 12 June 2014 at Bunnings Booval by which one of the accused’s credit cards was used to purchase of a number of items, including a role of tape described as “CLOTH TAPE NORTON, 50MM 25M BLACK 6613”. [2] 
	
	
	Evidence that investigating police purchased two rolls of the same (or similar) tape from “the exact same Bunnings store”. [3] 
	
	
	A roll of the tape purchased by police. [4]  It is described on the label as “General purpose” “Bear” tape and it boasts a “Specialty” as “Strong and versatile yet easy to tear by hand”.
	
	
	A recorded interview with the accused immediately after the incident in which he provided a version of events. [5] 
	
	
	A statement to police made by the accused on 13 June 2014. [6] 
	
	
	The evidence of Mr Collingwood in which he described the way in which the accused was bound when he found him. [7]  Mr Collingwood agreed that he told the police that he tried to break the tape that bound the accused wrists but was unable to do so. [8] 
	
	
	Photographs of the tape located at the scene and later when it was analysed by police. [9] 
	



	
	The evidence tendered on the voir dire included the statement of Detective Edmonds in which he set out the steps he took before conducting the experiment. [10]  This included the purchase of tape that the investigation suggested was of the same or similar type to that with which the accused was found as well as a summary of things the accused and Mr Collingwood told police as to the manner in which the accused was bound. The statement included production of the DVD showing the demonstration and this was also tendered on the voir dire. [11] 
	
	
	Extracts of the accused’s interviews with police were tendered on the voir dire, [12]  as was an expert report of Dr Joanna Bunford, an expert in forensic chemistry who carried out tests on the tape purchased by police. [13]  Since reserving my decision on the present issue, Dr Bunford gave evidence in the trial. [14]  Dr Bunford found the tape purchased by the police to be essentially of the same kind that was found at the scene of the murder. The only difference between the two items (higher levels of zinc in the tape found at the crime scene) was explicable on three bases and, in any event, did not appear to impact the relevant properties of the tape. In the course of her evidence, the jury was shown pieces of the tape and Dr Bunford demonstrated the ease with which a piece of tape could be torn. Dr Bunford also demonstrated the tape being torn after it had been folded over on itself. Her evidence included the opinion provided in her report that “the tape could be torn easily between the scrim threads that ran perpendicular to the long edges”. The “scrim” is a kind of hatched cloth binding that provides the tape with its strength. She also gave evidence of the details of her examination and experiments relating to the qualities, including the strength and “tearability”, of the tape. [15] 
	
	
	The parties agreed that the decision of the High Court in Evans v the Queen is binding authority for the proposition that s 53 Evidence Act “does not apply to what happens in the courtroom at the trial”. [16]  However, it appeared to be common ground that some of the matters referred to in s 53 are relevant to the resolution of the current controversy. The section provides:
	


53 Views

(1) A judge may, on application, order that a demonstration, experiment or inspection be held.

(2) A judge is not to make an order unless he or she is satisfied that:

(a) the parties will be given a reasonable opportunity to be present, and

(b) the judge and, if there is a jury, the jury will be present.

(3) Without limiting the matters that the judge may take into account in deciding whether to make an order, the judge is to take into account the following:

(a) whether the parties will be present,

(b) whether the demonstration, experiment or inspection will, in the court's opinion, assist the court in resolving issues of fact or understanding the evidence,

(c) the danger that the demonstration, experiment or inspection might be unfairly prejudicial, might be misleading or confusing or might cause or result in undue waste of time,

(d) in the case of a demonstration--the extent to which the demonstration will properly reproduce the conduct or event to be demonstrated,

(e) in the case of an inspection--the extent to which the place or thing to be inspected has materially altered.

(4) The court (including, if there is a jury, the jury) is not to conduct an experiment in the course of its deliberations.

(5) This section does not apply in relation to the inspection of an exhibit by the court or, if there is a jury, by the jury.


	
	The parties agreed that sub-s (4) prohibited the jury from undertaking its own tests or experiments on the tape in the course of its deliberations.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that, in the light of the decision in Evans v The Queen, the position is governed by the common law. The Crown placed some reliance on the decision in Kozul v The Queen [17]  where the High Court approved of a procedure where a jury was directed “to examine and handle” a revolver “so as to better understand the oral evidence”. [18]  There was an issue in that case as to whether the gun in question had been accidentally discharged. On the other hand, Gibbs CJ held:
	


“When the experiments conducted by the jury go beyond a mere examination and testing of the evidence, and become a means of supplying new evidence, they become impermissible”. [19] 


	
	As can be seen there is already evidence in the trial that will assist the jury in determining the issue concerning the credibility of the accused’s account in relation to the tape. The evidence goes both ways. For example, Mr Collingwood’s evidence suggests that the tape was difficult to tear or, at least, that he was unable to tear it in the circumstances in which he found himself. Against that, Dr Bunford’s analysis and opinion, along with her demonstration, suggest that the tape was easy enough to tear and this accorded with the labelling of the tape itself. There is a good deal of other evidence going to the credibility of his account more generally. That does not render irrelevant the evidence the Crown seeks to lead, and the demonstration or experiment it seeks to carry out, but it does reduce the importance of the evidence and demonstration.
	
	
	I have considered the recording of the demonstration undertaken by police. I have concluded that it lacks scientific rigour. I am not convinced that it replicates to a satisfactory degree any of the versions of the taping up of the accused provided by Mr Collingwood or by the accused. I am conscious of the difficulties confronting the investigating police that arose as a result of the different accounts given by the two witnesses and I proceed (in the absence of cross-examination) on the basis that the attempt to replicate events was a genuine one.
	
	
	Nevertheless, the demonstration may be misleading if the binding is different to that which actually prevailed prior to Mr Collingwood removing the tape on the morning of the murder. There are at least three aspects to this. The first relates to the precise areas on the body where the accused was bound. The difficulty (or ease) in breaking the binds may vary considerably if the tape were over the hands or closer to the hands that is portrayed in the demonstration. The same applies to the binds on the legs. A more scientific approach to the experiment (which is, I suspect, more of a demonstration of what the detectives believed) would have involved applying the binding in varying positions to reflect the variations in the versions provided by the witnesses. The second aspect is the number of areas of binding. On Mr Collingwood’s version in evidence, there may have been four areas of binding (the knees, the ankles and/or feet, the wrists and/or hands and the face). [20]  Most versions (of both Mr Collingwood and the accused) suggest only three areas of binding and it was on this basis that the police demonstration or experiment proceeded. A third area of possible variation between the reality of events on 13 June 2014 and the simulation undertaken by police concerns the tightness of the binding, both in terms of the number of times the tape was wrapped around and also the closeness of those binds. Detective West, who wrapped the tape around Detective Edmonds, did so hurriedly and there appeared to be no real attempt to make the bindings as tight and disabling as possible. The real perpetrators, if they existed, are likely to have done their best to make the binding as tight as possible.
	
	
	Apart from the nature of the binding, the simulation, experiment or demonstration could not replicate two essential features of the incident asserted by the accused. First, the fact that he was hit in the head. Second, the stress and panic resulting from the killing of his father.
	
	
	The evidence is also of a graphic nature and the jury, in spite of directions to treat it cautiously, may afford more weight to the evidence than it is entitled to.
	
	
	For those reasons, the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence may mislead the jury or cause unfair prejudice to the accused. Accordingly, I propose to exercise the discretion in s 135 Evidence Act and refuse to admit the evidence. Similarly, unless the accused wishes it to be adduced, I would rule to be inadmissible the questions asked of the accused in his recorded interview and the description and opinions concerning the simulation provided by Detective Edmonds in his statement.
	
	
	I turn to the second aspect of the evidence or demonstration referred to by the Crown Prosecutor. This concerns an application to have Detective Edmonds bound with the tape in the witness box and then demonstrate whether (or how) he would tear it off. This suffers potentially from the same flaws as the recorded simulation. That is, it is not possible to recreate the circumstances confronting the accused at the relevant time. It would be naïve to think that Detective Edmonds had not previously undertaken this exercise. The accused, if his story is to be believed, was a novice.
	
	
	Further, at the first adjournment after the evidence in chief of Dr Bunford, I raised with the Crown Prosecutor the possibility that any demonstration could be undertaken in the course of her evidence. [21]  As it turned out, Mr Wendler invited her to tear some of the tape in two different forms. In re-examination, it was open to the Crown to follow this up with further demonstrations and, to a degree, the matter was further explored and the nature of the tape and its properties communicated to the jury. As I said at the time, an independent expert such as Dr Bunford seemed to be a more appropriate person through whom to conduct such experiments.
	
	
	One way or another, I am not satisfied that the proposed demonstration by Detective Edmonds would advance the jury’s understanding of the issues to any significant degree. I ruled that the Crown would not be permitted to undertake a demonstration wherein Detective Edmonds would be bound by the tape in the witness box and invited to try to remove the tape.
	
	
	The final aspects of the Crown’s application is to have the jury handle the tape in various ways and be invited to try to tear it. It was submitted that this was analogous to the jury handling the gun in the case of Kozul v The Queen. I accept there are some similarities but the cases are far from being truly analogous. The ease with which a particular revolver might accidentally discharge is a relatively straightforward and direct issue that might readily be illuminated by inspection of the weapon in question. It is quite another thing to ask a jury to make an assessment of the ease with which a piece of tape might be torn and then to extrapolate from that the ease with which the accused could have escaped in the circumstance he claims prevailed shortly after his father’s murder. Those circumstances include – on his account – his being struck in the head and his exposure (audibly) to the extreme violence visited upon his father. Again, the problem exists as to the number of times the tape was wrapped around itself and the tightness of those binds.
	
	
	In Tootle v R [22]  the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal emphasised the dangers of inviting a jury in a criminal trial to become investigators. The jury’s role is to “maintain a position of impartial arbiter” and the “structure of the trial is undermined if the jury is permitted to take on an inquisitorial role”. [23]  The Court referred approvingly to the decision of the Minnesota Supreme Court in State of Minnesota v Gerard J Costello [24]  where it was said that “passive detachment” increases the probability that jurors will “remain open minded until the presentation of all of the evidence”. These cases concerned the jury being permitted (or encouraged) to ask questions of witnesses and, again, are not truly analogous. Even so, I have real concerns that undertaking the demonstration or experiment contemplated by the prosecution is apt to place the jury in the role of inquisitor or investigator and to do violence to their function of remaining impartial and passive observers and arbiters of the whole of the evidence.
	
	
	For those reason, I refused to permit the prosecution to undertake this third form of demonstration or experiment.
	
	
	Accordingly and in summary, I made the following rulings:
	



	
	Evidence of the simulation, experiment or demonstration carried out and recorded by investigating police on 10 December 2014 (and the opinions proffered as result) is not admissible.
	
	
	The proposed demonstration whereby Detective Edmonds would be bound with tape in the witness box and asked to attempt to extricate himself is not allowed.
	
	
	The proposed invitation to the jury to handle the tape and to tear it is not permitted.

6268116,R v Martin (No 4) [2017] NSWSC 1291,"EX TEMPORE Judgment (REVISED)


	
	Objection was taken to a number of photographs that the prosecution seeks to tender in the course of adducing the evidence of the pathologist who conducted the autopsy of the deceased. The accused is charged with murder, as well as two other offences directed towards the same victim (who was his father) and his father’s flatmate a couple of months earlier. The central issue in the trial is whether the accused was responsible for the crimes.
	
	
	The Crown case is that the accused attempted to secure the proceeds of two insurance policies taken out on his father’s life and that he attempted to kill his father on 6 or 7 April 2014 and then successfully did kill him on 12 or 13 June the same year. The Crown will invite the jury to infer that the murder weapon was a samurai sword owned by the accused. The accused raises an alibi in respect of the April incident. He says that he was at home in Esk in Queensland. He relies on a credit card payment at a service station in a town around 30 kilometres from Esk. In respect of the murder, the accused says that he was a victim, along with his father, of a home invasion perpetrated by unknown criminals. There is some evidence capable of supporting this including the evidence of a Mr Collingwood who found the accused at the foot of the stairs outside of the deceased’s flat bound with tape. The accused made a statement shortly after the killing in which he described the circumstances in which he was assaulted and in which his father was killed.
	
	
	I understand there will be further evidence of interviews in which the accused maintains this account. In addition to the accused’s accounts to police and the evidence of Mr Collingwood, there will also be evidence of injuries suffered by the accused. There is also evidence that the deceased mixed with bikies and had some enemies who may have been motivated to harm him.
	
	
	The objection was raised yesterday at the very end of the twelfth day of the trial in anticipation that the pathologist would give evidence at 10:00am today. The parties tendered the photographs on the voir dire, [1]  and stated their positions with admirable economy. This morning the Crown revised its position in respect of one of the photographs.
	
	
	Counsel for the accused objected to all of the photographs. There are 13 photographs in total. Each depicts the deceased, or parts of his body. One was taken at the scene of the crime and the other 12 were taken in the course of the post-mortem examination. As a fall back or alternative position, Mr Wendler took particular objection to two photographs. The first is the photograph that was taken of the deceased in situ (photograph number 65). The second is a particularly graphic photograph taken in the course of the post-mortem examination (photograph number 29). Photograph 29 is a close-up of a wound to the victim’s throat.
	
	
	In short, the parties agreed that the issue came down to an assessment of the probative value of the evidence and balancing that against the capacity of the evidence to cause prejudice to the accused. The prejudice arises from the graphic nature of the photographs, and the possibility or likelihood that they will evoke an emotional response from the jury or from individual members of the jury. Neither counsel troubled me with any authorities of which there are many. This is perhaps understandable. The legal issue is clear and the decision must in each case turn on its own facts. In particular, consideration must be given to the nature of the photographs and the issues in the trial. However, in the limited time available, I have considered the decisions of Beech-Jones J in R v Phanekham (No 1) [2013] NSWSC 1695 and R v Meyn  (No 3) [2012] NSWSC 1467, as well as the Court of Criminal Appeal’s decision in R v Zammit [1999] NSWCCA 65. In the latter case, Wood CJ at CL referred to the type of graphic post-mortem photographs:
	


“…in respect of which a discretion commonly needs to be exercised to ensure that they do have a probative value which exceeds the prejudicial effect of any emotional reaction they might engender.”


	
	However, his Honour went on to say at 156:
	


“The sensitivity of jurors to photographs can too easily be overstated. I can see no reason why a degree of robustness should not be extended in this regard. Nor can I see why the tender of selected photographs, so long as they have a probative value, should be regarded as other than another step in the course of a trial in which the fact of violent death is patent for all.”


	
	In the case of each photograph sought to be tendered in the present trial, the question turns on the probative value of the evidence. That question must be addressed by reference both to the cumulative impact of the photographs, and also the individual photographs. Different considerations arise in respect of the post-mortem photograph as distinct from the photograph of the deceased in situ. I will deal with that first, .although I note that when I came on to the bench about to deliver this judgment, the learned Crown Prosecutor indicated that he no longer pressed the admission of photograph 65. That concession or position is well justified in the following circumstances and, as I indicated when the Crown Prosecutor announced his change of position, I had intended to exclude that photograph in any event.
	
	
	The photograph is an image of the deceased in the position that he was found when emergency officers, paramedics and police, attended the scene. The Crown originally submitted that the relevance and probative value of the photograph lay in the fact that the accused claimed to have seen various injuries, whereas photograph 65 may tend to establish that he could not have made the observations he claims to have made. The Crown referred to the fact that an earlier witness (Mr Collingwood) said that he could not see any injuries. However, photograph 65 does not add much, if anything, to the evidence of Mr Collingwood on that issue.
	
	
	Further, Mr Collingwood gave evidence that the accused was moving about the room, and, at least by inference, removed a cushion or pillow that was laying over his deceased father. There is no evidence that could give rise to the inference that the accused was standing stationary, let alone standing and looking at the deceased from the point of view of the photographer of photograph 65. Even allowing that the evidence may have some probative value, I was satisfied that the danger of unfair prejudice outweighed that probative value and would have excluded the evidence under s 137, although that decision now becomes otiose because the Crown has properly decided not to adduce the evidence.
	
	
	There are then the 12 photographs taken during the post-mortem. Looked at globally, they have relevance. The Crown will ask the jury to infer that the accused used a samurai sword to inflict the injuries inflicted on the deceased. The injuries depicted in the photographs are of two kinds. First, there are injuries suggesting a slashing use of a bladed weapon, second, there are injuries consistent with a stabbing motion. The Crown tells me that he is in a position to call evidence that a samurai sword is capable of inflicting both types of injury, although as I understand it there will be an objection to some parts of the pathologist’s evidence in this regard.
	
	
	The Crown will also call a witness who trained the accused in the use of such a sword. There is already evidence that the accused owned a samurai sword albeit that this was some time ago, and the suggestion is that it was a ceremonial sword.
	
	
	There will also be evidence in the form of a letter written by the accused to his then wife that may suggest the accused lost control in the course of the attack on his father. The number and nature of wounds depicted in the photographs may also be relevant to that issue, or that alleged admission.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the evidence of the post-mortem photographs is relevant, and looked at globally, has a reasonably high degree of probative value as that expression is defined in the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). I am satisfied that any potential for prejudice can be overcome by direction.
	
	
	However photograph 29, to which a specific objection was taken, is a particularly graphic one. It depicts a wound to the victim’s throat, the photograph being taken at extremely close range. The same injury is depicted in photograph number 35, although it is not as clear a photograph of the specific injury. In any event, the learned Crown Prosecutor conceded in argument that he could use photograph 35 for much the same purpose as he would use photograph 29. I accept Mr Wendler’s submission that photograph 29 may arouse unnecessary emotion. It adds very little to the array of photographs. While it has some distinct and individual probative value, that value is outweighed by the prejudicial effect that may arise from the emotional response it is likely to elicit.
	
	
	However, the remaining photographs taken at post-mortem examination are admissible. While the photographs are likely to arouse some emotion, the jury will be directed as to the proper use that can be made of the photographs and reminded that the real issue in the case is whether it was the accused who inflicted these injuries.
	
	
	Accordingly, photograph 65 and 29 are excluded, and the remaining 11 photographs (although it may be ten given the duplication raised by the Crown this morning) may be admitted.

		27 October 2017",2017-09-19 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
6268131,R v Martin (No 5) [2017] NSWSC 1297,"EX TEMPORE Judgment (revised)


	
	An objection is taken to part of the evidence contained in an amended autopsy report created by a pathologist Dr Vuletic. [1]  The evidence is an assertion by the expert that:
	


“Some or all of the wounds could have been inflicted by a Samurai type sword.”


	
	That opinion comes in the context of a case in which the Crown alleges that the accused murdered his father for the proceeds of some insurance policies and will invite the jury to infer that he did so by using a Samurai sword.
	
	
	The evidence is that the accused owned such a sword, although the details of that are scant at this stage. I have been told that no Samurai sword was ever located. In any event, the Crown will rely on the fact that the accused did own such a sword and had some training in the use of one, to invite the jury to infer that that was the murder weapon. In that regard it relies on some post mortem photographs and will also seek to rely on the opinion of Dr Vuletic that I have just quoted.
	
	
	The objection is under s 135 of the Evidence Act, that the evidence maybe misleading or confusing, or may give rise to unfair prejudice. Towards the end of the submission it was also suggested also that it may raise an “expertise issue”. The basis of that latter submission was that the doctor had not actually seen the sword, but had simply been shown some photographs.
	
	
	The background to the amended report to which I have referred and the opinion it contains is extremely troubling. I have not been provided on the voir dire with the hard copies of email correspondence referred to by Mr Wendler in making his submissions on the objection. However, I accept that the emails that he read out are precisely those which passed between a police officer (Mr West) and the forensic pathologist who conducted the autopsy.
	
	
	The autopsy report in which the stated opinion that the wounds could have been inflicted by a Samurai type sword, was an amended report. The original autopsy report (also tendered on the voir dire) [2]  said that the wounds, at least the head wounds, were “most likely caused by an axe”. That opinion was provided at a time it seems when Dr Vuletic thought that the police theory of the case was that an axe was used because an axe was found at the murder scene.
	
	
	The second part of the original report which is relevant to the objection is that the wounds “did not show any particular characteristics to indicate the nature of the implement used”.
	
	
	That was the report provided by the doctor when she originally conducted the autopsy on the basis of the material that she had.
	
	
	There was then an exchange of emails between the police and the doctor, in which the police told the doctor that they had determined the wounds to the deceased were caused by a Samurai sword. It seems to have been put as plainly and bluntly as that. [3]  As I observed in argument, one wonders what the point is of having a forensic pathologist provide an opinion when the police purport to make such a determination based on their own suspicions.
	
	
	The fact of the matter is that exhibit VD-G (the amended report) seems to reflect the fact that the police gave the doctor further information upon which she acted, and upon which she changed her opinion from the fact that the wound to the head was “most likely caused by an axe”, or that the wounds did not show any particular characteristics sufficient to enable the nature of the implement to be determined, to an opinion that wounds could have been caused by a Samurai sword.
	
	
	Those are matters that are extremely relevant to an assessment of the credibility of the investigation and also to the credibility of any opinions provided by the doctor. However, issues of credibility do not generally result in the exclusion of relevant evidence. [4] 
	
	
	Given the issues in the trial, the doctor’s opinion that a samurai type sword could have caused the injuries is plainly relevant. I am unable to conclude that there is any unfair prejudice to the accused – the deficiencies in the evidence to which I have just referred will no doubt be clearly exposed in front of the jury and the weight that the jury would then afford to the opinion, whilst it will remain a matter for the jury, will also be subject of firm direction and warning.
	
	
	However, the evidence is not rendered inadmissible as a result of the matters referred to by Mr Wendler, although those matters are troubling, bordering on outrageous. Nevertheless the evidence may be admitted.

		27 October 2017",2017-09-19 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
6268137,R v Nikolovski (No 1) [2017] NSWSC 1450,"EX TEMPORE Judgment


	
	HER HONOUR: The Crown seeks to lead evidence in the trial of Jesse Nikolovski to establish that he had a tendency to commit armed robberies. On 21 August 2017, it served notice on the accused of its intent to do so. On 12 September 2017, a further updated notice was served. The accused, by notice of motion dated 8 September 2017, objects to the admission of the tendency evidence.
	


The Allegation Against the Accused


	
	On 15 September 2017, the accused was arraigned before me on indictment charging that he did on 7 March 2015, at Wickham in the State of New South Wales, murder Robert Parry. He is further charged that on the same date and at the same place, whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, he robbed Mr Parry of a small quantity of property.
	
	
	The Crown’s case is summarised by a Crown case statement which is in evidence on the motion. In brief, it is alleged that the accused was one of three individuals involved in an armed robbery, during the course of which Mr Parry was shot and killed. The Crown relies significantly on the evidence of Pheobe Bronner, who has been given the benefit of an indemnity from prosecution with respect to her role in the alleged murder. Ms Bronner is expected to tell the jury that she and the two accused men drove to Wickham in the early hours of 7 March 2015, in a car used by Mr Nikolovski. Mr Petryk had a gun and an axe. When Mr Nikolovski would not take the axe from him, Ms Bronner armed herself with it. Mr Petryk retained the gun. All three wore gloves and covered their faces. When the three arrived at the deceased’s home the front door was open. Mr Petryk is said to have urged Mr Nikolovski to enter the house with him but he stayed outside with Ms Bronner. When Ms Bronner went into the house from she says, curiosity, Mr Nikolovski followed her up the front steps and may have stepped inside the doorway of the premises.
	
	
	The deceased came out of his bedroom and saw Mr Petryk. He told him to “fuck off” and made a move as if to “whack” him. At that stage there was only a metre and a half or so between the two men. Mr Petryk may have demanded money and drugs from Mr Parry. The gun discharged and Mr Parry dropped to the floor. Mr Petryk went into another room and emerged soon after with some cannabis and cigarettes. The deceased’s father came out of his bedroom. He saw a man in the front doorway wearing dark clothes and a face covering. As I understand the Crown case, this man was the accused Mr Nikolovski. Mr Parry then saw another man emerge from the deceased’s bedroom. This is alleged to have been Mr Petryk. Mr Parry thought the man was holding a gun and a knife. He demanded money and drugs and said, “You’re next.” Ms Bronner and the accused Mr Nikolovski ran from the premises. The accused Mr Petryk followed soon after.
	
	
	Mr Parry was pronounced dead at 3.55am from a gunshot wound to the abdomen. There is evidence that a car broadly consistent with that driven by the accused, Mr Nikolovski was seen in the area at the relevant time. There is some other evidence of what could be construed as admissions made by Mr Nikolovski in conversations which were lawfully recorded. There is evidence against the accused Mr Petryk that he had possession of a gun at the material time, the gun being later matched to the bullet that killed the deceased.
	
	
	The Crown casts its case against the accused on the basis either that,
	



	
	he was a participant in a joint criminal enterprise to commit armed robbery with a dangerous weapon during which Mr Petryk shot Mr Parry with an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm or to kill. The accused foresaw the possibility that grievous bodily harm could be inflicted and continued nevertheless to participate in the enterprise; or
	
	
	that the accused participated in a joint criminal enterprise to carry out a robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, during which Mr Petryk shot and killed Mr Parry.
	


The Tendency Evidence


	
	The tendency the Crown seeks to prove is a tendency to act in a particular way, namely to commit robberies with other people whilst armed with weapons. The substance of the tendency is to be found in three documents, being an undated 9 page statement of agreed facts which bears the signature of the accused Mr Nikolovski, and a 4 page statement of facts under the hand of a solicitor from the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, and finally, a statement of facts from the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. The 9 page statement sets of the facts of three offences of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon, contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and one count of conspiring to commit such an offence, these being offences of which the accused has previously been convicted. The facts set out other offences that were dealt with by the sentencing court pursuant to s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) including a further s 97(1) offence.
	
	
	Briefly, the facts establish the following:
	
	
	In the early hours of 21 April 2015, the accused Mr Nikolovski and another male, went armed with a baseball bat, a metal pole, and a knife to the Royal Hotel in Leichhardt. They were wearing dark hooded clothing, gloves and black material across their faces. The accused and his then co-offender waited at the rear of the hotel for staff to leave prior to locking the hotel for the night. As the staff emerged from the hotel, the offenders took hold of one man and forced him back into the building. Money was demanded of him and an amount of cash was taken. The offenders ran off. The robbery had been planned by Mr Nikolovski and his then co-offender.
	
	
	Late on the evening of 11 May 2015, the accused and another three men confronted staff leaving the Red Lion Hotel in Rozelle at closing time. The offenders were armed with a meat cleaver and knives. One offender forced a staff member back inside the hotel whilst the others stood guard over remaining staff. An amount of cash was taken whereupon the offenders fled.
	
	
	At about 1am on 19 May 2015, the accused and others waited outside the Henson Hotel in Marrickville for staff to leave at closing time. When they came out, the offenders, who were armed with knives, forced the staff back into the hotel. A sum of cash was stolen by the offenders, who then fled.
	
	
	At closing time on the evening of 28 May 2015, the accused and others waited outside the Belfield Bowling Club. When a staff member came out he was tackled to the ground and forced to return to the club. The victim was assaulted and threatened with meat cleavers and forced to hand over cash. The offenders then fled. This robbery had been planned.
	
	
	Between 5 June 2015 and 16 June 2015, the accused’s mobile telephone was lawfully intercepted. He participated in a number of conversations in which he discussed the commission of an armed robbery. Late on the evening of 16 June 2015 the offender and others went armed with meat cleavers and a machete and with faces disguised, to the near vicinity of the Victoria Hotel at Annandale. Police approached them and some offenders were arrested immediately. The accused who fled was arrested on 17 June 2015.
	
	
	The facts of 9 July 2012, deal with two offences of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon. The Crown relies upon the document to prove the accused’s role in a robbery at the Fire Station Hotel and another robbery at the Blackbutt Hotel. It refers to the following offences:
	
	
	On 4 May 2011, the manager of the Fire Station Hotel Wallsend locked up for the night and then sat down to count the nights takings. The door of the office he was in was kicked open and the accused, who was armed with what appeared to be a pistol and another man who was armed with a knife, entered. Both were dressed in dark clothes and wore gloves. The accused pushed the pistol against the manager’s head and warned him that he had a gun. Money was demanded. The manager gave the robbers the money that he had been counting and the offenders fled.
	
	
	In the early hours of 17 May 2011, the accused and two others entered the Blackbutt Hotel at New Lambton which was closed, with only a cleaner on the premises. The offenders were armed with a pool cue, a stick and a knife. Using keys they found at the scene, the offenders opened the safe and a sum of money was taken. The robbers then left.
	
	
	The third document is a statement of facts from the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. It refers to the commission by the accused of an offence in that Territory of aggravated robbery which was committed on 28 May 2011 with other men on the Gungahlin Lakes Golf Club.
	
	
	Briefly the facts are that the offenders forced entry to the club before opening time and at a time when only a cleaner was present on the premises. The accused was said to be armed with what was described as a “long cylindrical object” held in the same manner as a long armed firearm. The facts speculates that it is possible the object was a broom handle or a shovel handle. A co-accused was armed with what is described as a black hand gun. During the robbery a quantity of cash was stolen from the golf club.
	
	
	The charges that reflect each of these offences proceeded upon the accused’s pleas of guilty and he was subsequently sentenced.
	


The Submissions of the Parties


	
	The Crown argues that the evidence of the accused’s participation in these robberies has significant probative value, because it is based upon conduct admitted by the accused and it establishes that he had a tendency to commit such offences, a tendency which existed both before and after the alleged murder.
	
	
	It is argued that the offences are factually similar to the present matter in that all were committed at night or in the very early morning, when the accused was both armed and disguised, and at the time when he was in the company of others. This is said to be factually identical to count 2 on the indictment in circumstances where count 2 is the foundational crime for constructive murder.
	
	
	The Crown contends that the target of the robberies the subject of the tendency notice is unimportant.
	
	
	The Crown submits that any prejudice that might be occasioned to the accused by the admission of this evidence can be addressed by appropriate directions and that any prejudice which may be occasioned is not unfair prejudice.
	
	
	The accused disputes the admissibility of the evidence. He impugns both the form of the evidence and the validity of the s 97 notice. The s 97 notice itself is challenged on the basis that it does not comply with the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), in that persons who saw the relevant conduct are not named on the notice. The form of the evidence is impugned because the documents before the Court, with the exception of one document, are statements of fact not adopted by the accused.
	
	
	Setting aside the issue of the validity of the notice and the form of the evidence, the accused contends that the asserted tendency the Crown seeks to prove is so general as to be meaningless. It is submitted that whilst the evidence may reach the level of being held to be relevant, its probative value is limited because of the very general nature of the tendency sought to be proved and such probative value as the evidence may have is outweighed by the prejudicial effect of adducing the evidence.
	


Consideration


	
	The starting point to consider the Crown’s application to lead this evidence and the accused’s dispute with it is to consider whether the evidence is relevant pursuant to s 55 of the Evidence Act since only evidence which is relevant is admissible. Evidence which if, it were accepted could rationally affect directly or indirectly the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceedings is relevant evidence. As Mr Massey for the accused has conceded, the tendency evidence is relevant in that it could bear upon the issues to be decided in the trial.
	
	
	The next step is to consider whether the evidence is admissible as tendency evidence. Section 97(1) of the Evidence Act relevantly provides:
	


“97    The Tendency Rule

(1)    Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person's character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind unless:

   (a)    the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party's intention to adduce the evidence, and

   (b)    the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.”


	
	There is no issue about the reasonableness of the notice to the accused of the intention to adduce tendency evidence.
	
	
	In Hughes v Queen [2017] HCA 20, the majority (Kiefel CJ, Bell, Keane and Edelman JJ), said at [16]:
	


“The probative value of evidence is the extent to which evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue. Tendency evidence will have significant probative value if it could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue to a significant extent. The trier of fact reasons from satisfaction that a person has a tendency to have a particular state of mind or to act in a particular way to the likelihood that the person had the particular state of mind or acted in a particular way on the occasion in issue. The starting point requires identifying the tendency and the fact or facts in issue which it is adduced to prove. The facts in issue in a criminal proceeding are those which establish the elements of the offence.”


	
	The Court must consider whether the evidence has significant probative value, that is whether the tendency evidence should make more likely to a significant extent the facts that make up the elements of the charged offence. R v Ford (2009) 201 A Crim R 451 at [125]. The evidence need not have this effect by itself, it is sufficient if the disputed evidence together with any other evidence to be placed before the jury has this effect.
	
	
	In Hughes the majority said that:
	


“The assessment of whether the evidence has significant probative value involves consideration of two interrelated, but separate matters. The first is the extent to which the evidence supports the asserted tendency. The second is the extent to which the tendency makes more likely the facts making up the charged offence. There need not be any similarity of conduct between the tendency incident and the charged offence.”


	
	From Hughes,
	


“…in summary there is likely to be a high degree of probative value where one the evidence by itself or together with other evidence strongly supports proof of a tendency and two, the tendency strongly supports the proof of a fact that makes up the offence charged” (at [41]).


	
	Here I have little difficulty in concluding that evidence of the accused’s participation in seven armed robberies and a conspiracy to commit a further such offence in the periods May 2011 and April to June 2015, supports a conclusion that the accused is a person with a tendency to commit armed robberies.
	
	
	The crimes for which the accused has been sentenced were committed, excluding the time the accused spent serving a custodial sentence, immediately before Mr Parry was killed and immediately after. Each offence involved the accused participating in a joint criminal enterprise with others to rob when armed with an offensive weapon.
	
	
	The crimes were all committed in the hours of darkness or the very early morning and on all but one occasion, the accused wore some sort of facial covering to disguise his face. I am satisfied that the evidence of the accused’s participation in these crimes taken by itself strongly supports proof of a tendency to commit robberies when armed and in company.
	
	
	I am not persuaded however that the tendency evidence strongly supports the proof of a fact that makes up the offence charged, whether considering count 1 or count 2 on the indictment, and even having regard to other evidence.
	
	
	The tendency which the Crown seeks to adduce evidence of is a tendency to commit robberies with other people whilst armed with weapons. The tendency as particularised is very general. It could apply to any person with criminal history that includes the commission of offences contrary to s 97(1) and would establish precisely the same thing, that the individual has committed armed robberies.
	
	
	In my assessment such evidence says little or nothing about the facts that go to make up the elements of the charged offences. It does not strongly support proof of any relevant fact. That is so, even when regard is had to the other evidence available to the Crown against this accused. The Crown’s case rests on Ms Bronner and her evidence will fall to be assessed in the context of the indemnity which she has been granted and her participation in the charged offences, to an apparently greater extent than that alleged against Mr Nikolovski.
	
	
	The only other evidence is the circumstantial evidence of the car seen in the area and that of the intercepted conversations. The tendency evidence does not materially add to that evidence in my view.
	
	
	The tendency evidence is capable of establishing that the accused has a tendency to commit armed robberies and more particularly armed robberies carried out using a particular method upon victims who fall within a particular category of person. But it is not capable of establishing anything of greater relevance to the charged offence.
	
	
	It is perhaps not inapposite to observe that the sort of armed robbery charged against the accused here falls within a category of armed robberies which are sufficiently distinctive from other examples of the crime as to have attracted a colloquial name, being “home invasion”.
	
	
	That an individual has a tendency to carry out armed robberies on commercial licensed premises using a distinctive methodology does not of itself go to make it more likely that the same individual would carry out a home invasion on a domestic residence. Indeed, it could arguably suggest the opposite proposition.
	
	
	For the evidence to be admissible as tendency evidence there is no need that it show that the accused used a consistent modus operandi or that there was a similar pattern of conduct, but it does need to say something about the facts in issue. Here the dissimilarities arguably render the evidence incapable of supporting the proof of any element of either count 1 or count 2.
	
	
	In Hughes the majority said at [64],
	


“…the assessment of the significant probative value of the proposed evidence does not conclude by assessing its strength in establishing a tendency. The second matter to consider is that the probative value of the evidence will also depend on the extent to which the tendency makes more likely the elements of the offence charged. This will necessarily involve a comparison between the tendency and the facts in issue. A tendency expressed at a high level of generality might mean that all the tendency evidence provides significant support for that tendency, but it will also mean the tendency cannot establish anything more than relevance. In contrast a tendency expressed at a level of particularity will be more likely to be significant.”


	
	That the evidence is only capable of establishing that the accused is someone who has a tendency to commit armed robberies in a general sense limits its probative value. That is particularly so in circumstances where the armed robberies particularised in the tendency notice show many marked dissimilarities to the charged offences, including the venues targeted for robbery (the tendency incidents relating to licensed public bars as opposed to a private domestic residence), and the weapons used (always an offensive weapon in the tendency incidents but a dangerous weapon in the charged offences).
	
	
	Even if I am wrong in this assessment I would not regard the evidence as satisfying the second barrier to the admission of tendency evidence, that posed by s 101 of the Evidence Act, which provides:
	


“101   Further Restrictions on Tendency Evidence and Coincidence Evidence Adduced by Prosecution

(1)   This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sections 97 and 98.

(2)   Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.

(3)   This section does not apply to tendency evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by the defendant.

(4)    This section does not apply to coincidence evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict coincidence evidence adduced by the defendant.”


	
	The probative value of the tendency evidence is limited in that it can do no more than establish that the accused is a person with a tendency to commit armed robberies of a very distinctive character, a character wholly dissimilar to the charged offences. The prejudicial effect of the evidence is, by contrast, likely to be considerable.
	
	
	One can readily foresee how such evidence could be misused by a jury, even a jury to which strong directions have been given. The jury may consider that its enquiry stops with the receipt of the tendency evidence as jurors may reason that because the accused has committed armed robberies on other occasions he must have committed the robbery of Mr Parry in which Mr Parry was shot. Or the jury might reason that the accused must be one of the two men seen by Alan Parry in his home that night, because he is an armed robber, without considering how many offenders share the tendency imputed to the accused. Or, the jury may reason that the accused is a bad person because of his many convictions for serious armed robbery offences and give that conclusion undue weight in considering the evidence and the question of whether the Crown has proved the offences beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	The potential for substantial prejudice is high and I am not satisfied that there is any direction I could craft which could overcome that prejudice.
	
	
	The disputed evidence amounts to little more than evidence of bad character without any of the probative significance that would make it admissible as tendency evidence. It could not be said that the probative value outweighs the prejudicial effect to any extent, let alone substantially.
	
	
	On that basis I excluded earlier this morning the evidence set out in the tendency notices of 21 August 2017 and 12 September 2017.

		25 October 2017",2017-09-17 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
6268146,R v Martin (No 2) [2017] NSWSC 1250,"Judgment


	
	On Wednesday 6 September 2017, the third day of what was estimated to be a six week trial for attempted murder, infliction of grievous bodily harm and murder, I made an order discharging a juror pursuant to s 53B of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW) and an order under s 53C of that Act that the trial would continue with 11 jurors. These are my reasons for those decisions.
	


Discharge of juror


	
	A jury was empanelled on Monday 4 September 2017. A jury had been empanelled earlier that day but was discharged before the accused was placed in its charge (but after the jury was sworn or affirmed) for reasons of no present relevance. Following the second empanelment, the Crown Prosecutor commenced his detailed opening statement. The opening continued into the second day and five witnesses were called to give evidence. Towards the end of the second day, three sheriffs or court officers were sworn or affirmed to attend to the jury on a view, which was scheduled to take place on Wednesday 6 September 2017. [1]  At the end of the second day, the trial was adjourned to a location in Murwillumbah at 11-30am the following day. The jury was directed to attend at the Lismore Court House at the usual time whereupon they were to be transported by bus to the scene. The parties, a court reporter, my staff and I were to travel separately to the location of the view.
	
	
	Shortly before 10am on the morning of the view, my Associate received a telephone call from the Senior Sheriff at Lismore. He advised that there was a problem with a juror who had attended Court with a medical certificate indicating that she was unfit to serve as a juror. My Associate contacted the parties and arrangements were made for the Court to reassemble in the Courtroom in Lismore as soon as possible. The Court was reconstituted at around 10:45am.
	
	
	Very little detail was provided in the medical certificate, which was redacted (to obscure the identity of the juror) and marked as MFI 7. The original document was placed in a sealed envelope to maintain the anonymity of the juror. The Sheriff informed me, and I informed the parties, that the information provided to him was that the juror’s daughter was in the advanced stages of pregnancy and that, overnight, the baby (or mother) had gone into “foetal distress”. The juror had suffered similar symptoms in an earlier pregnancy and was greatly distressed and wanted to be with her daughter.
	
	
	The parties each submitted and agreed that the information was sufficient to satisfy the requirements for the discharge of the juror under s 53B(d) which allows for the discretionary discharge of a juror if:
	


“…it appears to the court or coroner that, for any other reason affecting the juror's ability to perform the functions of a juror, the juror should not continue to act as a juror.”


	
	I agreed with the parties’ joint position. It was clear from the information provided by the Sheriff, and from his description of the juror’s state of distress, that the juror would be unable to focus on the evidence and that she would be preoccupied by the condition of her daughter and the unborn child. This would affect her ability to perform the functions of a juror and satisfied me that she should not continue to act as a juror.
	
	
	Accordingly, pursuant to s 53B(d), juror number 395-90 was discharged.
	


Decision to continue with a jury of 11


	
	Initially, counsel for the accused foreshadowed an application that the balance of the juror be discharged pursuant to s 53C(1) of the Jury Act. [2]  That section provides:
	


(1) If a juror dies, or the court or coroner discharges a juror in the course of a trial or coronial inquest, the court or coroner must:

(a) discharge the jury if the court or coroner is of the opinion that to continue the trial or coronial inquest with the remaining jurors would give rise to the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice, or

(b) if of the opinion that there is no such risk and subject to section 22, order that the trial or coronial inquest continue with a reduced number of jurors.


	
	It was not surprising that counsel took that initial approach given the observations of various members of the High Court in Wu v The Queen (1999) 199 CLR 99; [1999] HCA 52, an important case in which Mr Wendler (representing the accused in the present trial) appeared nearly 20 years ago. I adjourned briefly to consider the terms of the Jury Act and any cases decided on the issue, and to allow the parties to formulate their positions. With the consent of the parties, I also obtained information as to when it would be possible for the Sheriff to arrange for jury panels to attend so that the trial could be relisted quickly.
	
	
	When I returned, Mr Wendler indicated that his instructions were that the accused wished to the proceed with 11 jurors: [3] 
	


“During the adjournment I made telephone contact with the AVL room at Grafton. I put my phone on speaker so my instructing solicitor could hear that conversation between myself and the accused. I explained his legal rights under the Jury Act and we discussed generally his legal position as it stands and other permutations concerning the future of the trial. He instructed me unequivocally that he wishes to retain this jury and agrees to the trial proceeding with 11 jurors as constituting the trial jury.”


	
	I indicated that this was an important consideration but that the accused’s consent did not relieve me from performing the task under s 53C, a proposition with which counsel agreed.
	
	
	As the judgments in Wu v The Queen make clear, the parties in a criminal trial are prima facie entitled to a decision made by a jury consisting of twelve members of the community randomly selected. McHugh J at [27] noted that “[f]or hundreds of years, the common law has insisted that no person be convicted of serious crime without the unanimous verdict of twelve jurors”. The common law required the whole jury to be discharged if an individual juror was discharged. Even allowing for legislative amendment McHugh J stressed at [28]:
	


“But no-one should think that, once a juror dies or is discharged, the trial should automatically continue with the remaining jurors. Conviction by a jury of less than twelve is a denial of a long-standing right of those tried for serious crime under the common law system”.


	
	Kirby J referred to the historical significance of the “magic” number of twelve jurors. [4] 
	
	
	I considered the considerable force in the statements of the High Court in Wu v The Queen. I also took into account the provision in s 22 of the Jury Act, allowing for a trial to continue with a jury of less than twelve. I considered the fact that the reasons for the juror’s discharge did not concern any matter relevant to the facts of the trial itself and, accordingly, there was no chance that the juror’s discharge had a capacity to affect the ability of the remaining eleven jurors properly to perform their function. I considered the estimated length of the trial and the risk that if another juror is discharged, the jury would be reduced to ten, the number below which the trial cannot continued in the absence of the written consent of the parties. [5]  I also gave significant weight to the seriousness of the charges faced by Mr Martin and his clearly stated position that, with the benefit of his lawyers’ advice, he wished to continue with the remaining eleven jurors.
	
	
	Having considered all relevant matters I formed the opinion that there was no risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice as a result of the discharge of the individual juror and the continuation of the trial with the remaining eleven jurors.
	
	
	Accordingly, pursuant to s 53C(b) of the Jury Act, I ordered that the trial continue with the remaining eleven jurors.

		27 October 2017",2017-09-05 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
6268153,R v Martin (No 3) [2017] NSWSC 1251,"Judgment


	
	Prior to the jury being empanelled in the trial, counsel for the accused made an application that the jury be taken on a view of five or six locations in the vicinity of premises at 18-20 Quarry Road, South Murwillumbah. The Crown did not oppose the conduct of a view of those scenes and suggested that the jury also be shown a couple of other locations in the same vicinity. The parties generally agreed as to the places and things that the jury should be shown but disagreed whether the jury should be invited or directed to ascend and descend a particular set of stairs located at those premises.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 53 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) I ordered that a view (“inspection”) be conducted of the agreed locations and things. However, I declined the Crown’s application that the jury be invited to ascend and descend the staircase. These are my reasons for those rulings.
	
	
	Section 53 of the Evidence Act provides:
	


53   Views

(1) A judge may, on application, order that a demonstration, experiment or inspection be held.

(2) A judge is not to make an order unless he or she is satisfied that:

(a) the parties will be given a reasonable opportunity to be present, and

(b) the judge and, if there is a jury, the jury will be present.

(3) Without limiting the matters that the judge may take into account in deciding whether to make an order, the judge is to take into account the following:

(a) whether the parties will be present,

(b) whether the demonstration, experiment or inspection will, in the court's opinion, assist the court in resolving issues of fact or understanding the evidence,

(c) the danger that the demonstration, experiment or inspection might be unfairly prejudicial, might be misleading or confusing or might cause or result in undue waste of time,

(d) in the case of a demonstration--the extent to which the demonstration will properly reproduce the conduct or event to be demonstrated,

(e) in the case of an inspection--the extent to which the place or thing to be inspected has materially altered.

(4) The court (including, if there is a jury, the jury) is not to conduct an experiment in the course of its deliberations.

(5) This section does not apply in relation to the inspection of an exhibit by the court or, if there is a jury, by the jury.


	
	As to the prohibition in subs (2), the accused elected not to be present on the view but indicated that both his extremely experienced counsel and his solicitor would be present. Even though the accused is in custody, there was no suggestion that it was not possible for suitable arrangements to be made to allow him to attend on the view.
	
	
	The accused is charged with serious crimes arising out of two separate incidents. Both incidents occurred within the same premises at 18-20 Quarry Road, South Murwillumbah. There are a number of eye-witnesses to the movement of people and things in and around those premises. There is also CCTV footage obtained from premises diagonally across the road from the premises. Further, the parties will invite the jury to draw certain inferences from the direct evidence and from the surroundings in which the events giving rise to both counts unfolded.
	
	
	I formed the opinion that the jury would obtain a greater understanding of the reliability and significance of the eye-witness evidence if they were able to see precisely where the witnesses were when they made their observations, where they said the things were which they observed, and the distances and point of view from which the CCTV footage was taken. While there is a body of photographic evidence, this is no substitute (in the circumstances of the present case) to actually seeing the site, and understanding the distances and perspectives of the witnesses and video footage.
	
	
	The criteria in sub-s (3) militated in favour of a view being conducted. There was evidence (given after the inspection was ordered) that there was no material alteration to the scene. Neither party suggested the jury needed to enter the premises where, it is assumed, there have been significant changes made by the new occupants to what is, in essence, a single room apartment with a small adjacent kitchen and bathroom. Where changes had occurred in the vicinity of the proposed inspection (for example, the erection of temporary building behind the premises), those were easily identified for the benefit of the jury. The alterations were not “material” and would not result in the inspection being confusing or misleading.
	
	
	For those reasons, I acceded to what was a joint application for a view (inspection) of various locations identified by the parties.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the jury should also be invited or directed to ascend and descend the staircase outside of the flat in which the murder (and the earlier offence) took place. The significance of this was identified as follows: [1] 
	


“Your Honour, having walked the stairs, the descent gives an entirely different impression from the view up and as part of the Crown case is that the injuries the accused had are inconsistent with his description that he rolled down the stairs. For that reason, I was asking the jury to examine the nature of the stairs themselves, including their steepness and length.”


	
	The reference to the injuries suffered by the accused is a reference to the fact that the accused asserted that he fell down the stairs (or tumbled or rolled down them as he escaped the premises), while he was tied up with “gaffer” tape. This occurred, on the accused’s account, after he was a joint victim of the home invasion which led to the death of his father. The Crown case is that the accused was the perpetrator of the home invasion and that he staged his own injuries.
	
	
	A particular problem with conducting this inspection in the present case is that at least one member of the jury raised with the sheriff a difficulty in using the stairs in the Lismore Court House (which are not particularly steep or onerous to ascend). Special arrangements were made to allow that juror (and, now, the rest of the jury) to depart via an exit that involves less stairs. When this was raised in argument, the Crown suggested that the jury could be “invited” to ascend and descend the stairs if they chose. Assuming not all of the jury accepted that invitation, the result would be that some but not all of the jury would have the benefit (if it be a benefit) of looking down the staircase.
	
	
	Further, and more importantly, I was not persuaded that looking down the staircase would provide the jury with a better understanding of the evidence and the inferences it may be invited to draw. On the contrary, undertaking that inspection (or experiment) may be misleading. The perspective from above may – for any member of the jury who suffers from vertigo or had any fear of heights or falling – provide an erroneous or exaggerated impression of the likelihood of injury, or the nature and extent of the likely injury, that would arise if a person fell or tumbled down the subject staircase. The view from the side and below would (and did) allow the jury to gauge the height and width of the staircase as well as see the material of which it is constructed. That is sufficient for the purpose of drawing any rational inference (assuming there is not to be any expert evidence on this subject).
	
	
	The fact that the view from above provided an “entirely different impression” does not mean that it provided a more accurate impression or basis upon which to draw rational inferences.
	
	
	For those reasons, I determined that the jury would not be requested or directed to ascend the staircase.
	
	
	[The view was conducted on 7 September 2017 and the jury was most attentive and engaged throughout the inspection. The conduct of the view confirmed my decision that it was desirable to conduct the view and that what the jury saw of the staircase was sufficient for the purposes of the trial.]

6268222,Robinson v State of New South Wales [2017] NSWDC 289,"Judgment

A. Introduction


	
	Bradford Robinson walked into the Day Street Sydney City Police Station at 5pm on 22 December 2013 and was arrested by Constable Adam Smith in connection with a breach of an apprehended personal violence order. Mr Robinson was offered and accepted the opportunity to participate in a record of interview. An interview was conducted. At 6.18pm, after the interview had concluded, Mr Robinson was released without charge. He sues the State of New South Wales for unlawful imprisonment. The vicarious liability of the State for any tort of Constable Smith is not disputed.
	


B. Power of Arrest


	
	Section 99 of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 (“LEPRA”) deals with a police officer's power of arrest. It was amended a few days before the arrest. At the time of the arrest, it relevantly provided:
	


“99 Power of police officers to arrest without warrant

(1) A police officer may, without a warrant, arrest a person if:

(a) the police officer suspects on reasonable grounds that the person is committing or has committed an offence, and

(b) the police officer is satisfied that the arrest is reasonably necessary for any one or more of the following reasons:

(i) to stop the person committing or repeating the offence or committing another offence,

…

(iv) to ensure that the person appears before a court in relation to the offence,

…

(vii) to prevent the harassment of, or interference with, any person who may give evidence in relation to the offence,

…

(ix) because of the nature and seriousness of the offence.

…

(3) A police officer who arrests a person under this section must, as soon as is reasonably practicable, take the person before an authorised officer to be dealt with according to law.

Note. The police officer may discontinue the arrest at any time and without taking the arrested person before an authorised officer—see section 105.

(4) A person who has been lawfully arrested under this section may be detained by any police officer under Part 9 for the purpose of investigating whether the person committed the offence for which the person has been arrested and for any other purpose authorised by that Part.

…”


	
	Subparagraph (ix), referring to the nature and seriousness of the offence, was, unlike the other provisions quoted, not in the previous form of s 99 of LEPRA. The form quoted was enacted on 16 December 2013, just before the arrest of Mr Robinson.
	
	
	Section 105 of LEPRA provided:
	


“105 Arrest may be discontinued

(1) A police officer may discontinue an arrest at any time.

(2) Without limiting subsection (1), a police officer may discontinue an arrest in any of the following circumstances:

(a) if the arrested person is no longer a suspect or the reason for the arrest no longer exists for any other reason,

(b) if it is more appropriate to deal with the matter in some other manner, including, for example, by issuing a warning or caution or a penalty notice or court attendance notice or, in the case of a child, dealing with the matter under the Young Offenders Act 1997.

(3) A police officer may discontinue an arrest despite any obligation under this Part to take the arrested person before an authorised officer to be dealt with according to law.”

C. Issues


	
	Mr Robinson did not give evidence. He does not claim any personal injury damages and although compensatory, aggravated and exemplary damages are sought, no evidence of matters of aggravation personal to him is in evidence. For example, he relied upon a lack of apology by the police in his statement of claim as a matter of aggravation but it was not in dispute that he bore the onus on that matter and that there was no evidence about it. In submissions, Mr Robinson expressly conceded that not much could be awarded for aggravated damages because Mr Robinson had given no evidence, including no evidence of humiliation or of the presence of other persons at Mr Robinson’s arrest.
	
	
	Apart from the issue of damages and its components, issues arise from s 99. Constable Smith relies on s 99(1)(a) and (i), (iv) and (ix) of s 99(1)(b). Thus, the issues on liability are:
	



	
	Did Constable Smith suspect that Mr Robinson had committed an offence?
	
	
	Did Constable Smith have reasonable grounds for suspecting that Mr Robinson had committed an offence?
	
	
	Was Constable Smith satisfied that the arrest was reasonably necessary to stop Mr Robinson repeating the offence?
	
	
	Was Constable Smith satisfied that the arrest was reasonably necessary to ensure that Mr Robinson appeared before the Court in relation to the offence?
	
	
	Was Constable Smith satisfied that the arrest was reasonably necessary because of the nature and seriousness of the offence?
	



	
	Mr Robinson also raised two further issues. First, the need for the arrest to be made in good faith for the purpose of conducting the prosecution, not for some extraneous purpose such as investigation. Secondly, that the continued detention after the arrest was, in any event, unlawful.
	


D. The matters informing the belief of Constable Smith


	
	The belief of Constable Smith is relevant to several of the issues. At the time of the arrest, that belief was informed by the following matters, recorded in a file which Constable Smith had read earlier on the day of arrest:
	



	
	On 8 October 2013 Roselyn Singh reported threatening phone calls and blackmail by Mr Robinson.
	
	
	On 9 October 2013 an apprehended personal violence order was made against Mr Robinson for the protection of Ms Singh. The order restrained Mr Robinson, among other things, from harassing Ms Singh, from engaging in conduct that intimidates Ms Singh, from contacting Ms Singh ""by any means whatsoever"" except by his lawyer, and from deliberately damaging or interfering with the property of Ms Singh.
	
	
	On 16 October 2013 the Local Court of New South Wales made an apprehended violence order interim until future order in terms equivalent to the earlier order.
	
	
	Mr Robinson ran a website with associated email addresses including “brad@datatheft.com.au”. Those email addresses had been used to contact Ms Singh. She had blocked the email address, brad@datatheft.com.au.
	
	
	On 18 December 2013 an employee of Ms Singh informed her that he had received an email from Mr Robinson. Ms Singh checked her computer and found the email in her junk box sent from brad@datatheft.com.au. Ms Singh read the email, became very frightened, began crying and felt unable to control her fear. Ms Singh was worried about Mr Robinson's future actions as he had previously attended her home addresses pretending to be police in an attempt to get her to answer the door. Because of this and previous incidents, Ms Singh was feeling paranoid that Mr Robinson was following her.
	
	
	On 20 December 2013 Ms Singh attended Town Hall Police Station and reported some of the matters above, including (d) and (e) above. A statement was prepared, which Ms Singh signed, attesting to these matters. The statement also recorded that Mr Robinson had attempted to contact Ms Singh, her employees, colleagues, business partners and others to, in the words of Ms Singh, ""inform them I have been defrauding people and am under police investigation"" and that she has, ""since blocked this email address"" . Ms Singh named the employee who contacted her about having received the email from Mr Robinson.
	
	
	In her statement, Ms Singh said the email received by her employee was also found in her junk box, that it was from brad@datatheft.com.au and that she opened it and it said:
	


“Hi, Everybody,

Hope you are all well. Thought you might like to know Ms Singh and her company UTSG Consortium Pty Ltd (Sydney City Medical) are being wound up.

She finally tried to rip off somebody who had the financial clout to fight back.

You will notice in the article, Singh registered my blog name ‘Data Theft Australian’ as a business names [sic]. This is another scam Singh uses to convince victims she owns certain businesses or organisations. She did the same with City Clinic and other competitor businesses in the Sydney CBD.

Kind regards

Brad"".


	
	Ms Singh said in her statement at [10]:
	


“As soon as I read the email I felt really frightened and my heart started beating really fast. I began crying as I could not control the fear I was feeling. I am worried about Brad's future actions as I believe he has an unstable state of mind. Brad has previously attended my home addresses and I am afraid he will go to my home again and this has caused me to be in a permanent state of anxiousness and stress which is causing me to become paranoid that he is following me.”


	
	The email in the file was apparently forwarded to Ms Singh by the employee. The email contained what might be described as a rational and unemotive reply by Ms Singh to the employee stating that she would ""forward to detective - this is a breach of his Bail conditions"". So far as appears from the email, the employee received his email from ""'Brad Robinson’ "" and it was presumably sent to other unidentified email addresses, including the employee’s email address.
	



	
	Constable Smith’s belief at the time of arrest was also informed by two further matters:
	



	
	At 11.15am on Sunday, 22 December 2013 police, including Constable Smith, attended ""the residence"" of Mr Robinson and ascertained from neighbours that Mr Robinson no longer resided at the address. Enquiries of the real estate agency for a forwarding address were unsuccessful as it was closed on the Sunday.
	
	
	At noon on Sunday, 22 December 2013 Mr Robinson called the police, stating to a Constable Colakides that he was made aware by the police at North Sydney that the Sydney City Police wanted to speak with him regarding a breach of an Apprehended Violence Order (“AVO”). Mr Robinson said he was homeless, currently interstate and would be in Sydney tomorrow. He refused to provide the police with an address of where he would be the next day and stated that he would not attend any police station before seeking legal representation. The police advised him to attend Sydney City Police Station tomorrow regarding breaching an AVO. Mr Robinson was argumentative and did not agree to attend the police station. The police proposed to follow up on the next day, 23 December 2013. Constable Colakides made a note on the COPS record in the terms indicated above, and informed Constable Smith of the conversation, including that Mr Robinson had said that he was interstate and would not be coming to the police station.
	



	
	At 5pm that same day, Sunday, 22 December 2013 Mr Robinson entered the police station. Constable Smith immediately arrested him in connection with the breach of the AVO, and thereafter the interview with Mr Robinson was conducted. No details of the substance of that interview were in evidence.
	
	
	Constable Smith, after reading the documents in the folder on the morning of 22 December 2013, formed the opinion that a breach of the AVO had occurred and that he would go to Mr Robinson’s address to arrest him. He said that the basis of the arrest was the seriousness of breaching a court order, the AVO, and ""to stop any further offences occurring, or breaches of that, that order."" He was asked ""Did you have any reason to suspect that another breach may occur?"" And he answered, ""Not at that time, but from what the information I'd been given, I believed that a breach had occurred and that it should have been dealt with.""
	
	
	Constable Smith also gave evidence that he did not believe Mr Robinson would turn up to court. The foundation for this belief was presumably the unsuccessful visit to Mr Robinson’s noted address, that Mr Robinson was not residing at his last listed address (T48/5), and the information from Constable Colakides, including that Mr Robinson was interstate (T38/24) and “[h]e wouldn't tell us where he was living over the telephone” (T48/6).
	
	
	Constable Smith also gave evidence that he believed it was necessary to arrest Mr Robinson for the alleged breach of the AVO. Constable Smith subsequently repeated in evidence the reasons for the arrest being the seriousness of the offence, to prevent a repetition of the offence and to ensure an appearance in court. Generally, I accepted Constable Smith’s evidence.
	


E. Did Constable Smith suspect that Mr Robinson had committed an offence?


	
	In submissions, Mr Robinson accepted that Constable Smith had suspected a breach of the AVO. Constable Smith gave evidence of a belief that he had sufficient evidence to arrest Mr Robinson, and the contrary to that belief was not put to him. I accept that Constable Smith suspected the commission of the offence.
	


F. Did Constable Smith have reasonable grounds for that suspicion?


	
	In order to establish reasonable grounds for a suspicion, the objective circumstances need not establish, on the balance of probabilities, that the fact exists, for the assent of belief is given on more slender evidence than proof (see George v Rockett (1990) 170 CLR 104 at 116; [1990] HCA 26, Hyder v Commonwealth of Australia [2012] NSWCA 336 at [15(5)]). Suspicion is something less than belief (see R v Rondo [2001] NSWCCA 540 at [53]).
	
	
	Mr Robinson did not dispute that he sending the quoted email to Ms Singh would be sufficient to provide reasonable grounds for the suspicion of Constable Smith. Whether there was sufficient evidence to provide reasonable grounds for the suspicion was disputed principally on two bases:
	



	
	Constable Smith had not been provided with a copy of the email allegedly found in Ms Singh’s junk email folder (and presumably that created a doubt about whether the email was sent to her); and
	
	
	Constable Smith had not determined whether to charge Mr Robinson at the time of the arrest, and ultimately did not charge Mr Robinson.
	



	
	As to (a), it is correct that the email from Ms Singh’s junk folder had not been provided to the police. And despite requests for it, it appears never to have been provided to the police. The relevance of the requests for the junked email is limited and insofar as those requests are recorded on the COPS record, they occurred after the arrest and so do not constitute information available to Constable Smith at the time of the arrest. Constable Lance Carson made enquiries to obtain the original junked email, but there is no evidence that those attempts occurred before Mr Robinson was arrested, or, even if they did, that Constable Smith was informed of them.
	
	
	Although reasonable grounds for a suspicion might be judged against ""what was known or reasonably capable of being known at the relevant time"" (Ruddock v Taylor (2005) 222 CLR 612 at [40]; [2005] HCA 48, see also Hyder at [15(7)]), I do not accept that it was reasonably capable of being known by Constable Smith that Ms Singh would not, and would be unable to, produce the directly received email from her junk folder despite repeated requests, since those repeated requests and a reasonable time for a response had not occurred at the time of the arrest.
	
	
	However, there was information from Ms Singh, in her statement and on the COPS record, that she had received the email. In my view, that is enough to provide reasonable grounds for a suspicion that she did. Her failure to provide the email from her junk folder when she visited the police station on 20 December 2013 is not sufficient, in my mind, to displace the reasonable basis for the suspicion constituted by her provision of the copy email of her employee and the repeated notations on the file of her claim that she had directly received the same email.
	
	
	I note that Ms Singh’s statement refers to her receiving an email from the email address “brad@datatheft.com.au” whereas the email received by the employee appears to have been sent from “datatheft.au@gmail.com” and received by “brad@datatheft.com.au”. The explanation for this may lie in the email Ms Singh found in her junk folder having come from a different address associated with Mr Robinson than the address used to send the email to her employee, and there are other possible explanations. It does not displace the evidence of Ms Singh recorded in the COPS record and in her signed statement that she received the same email (in substance) directly, having found it in her junk folder.
	
	
	Mr Robinson also referred to the evidence that Ms Singh had ""blocked"" that sender, brad@datatheft.com.au. Of itself, this evidence does not clarify whether the method of ""blocking"" was effective only to direct an email to the junk email folder, or whether the blocking occurred only after the subject email had been received by Ms Singh. Again, it does not displace Ms Singh’s account that she received the email.
	
	
	I accept that a copy of the email received directly by Ms Singh might be required at a criminal trial to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the email was in fact received. I do not accept that at 5pm on 22 December 2013, Constable Smith needed a copy of the email received directly by Ms Singh in her junk folder before he could hold a suspicion on reasonable grounds that the email had been received by Ms Singh.
	
	
	The second challenge to the finding of reasonable grounds, item (b) above, was that Constable Smith had not determined to charge Mr Robinson at the time of the arrest. I think that matter might lead to an inference that Constable Smith may have had doubts as to whether the offence had occurred, and that he may have wanted to give Mr Robinson an opportunity to explain the matter before charging him. That does not address the question of whether he had reasonable grounds for a suspicion. As noted above, reasonable suspicion involves less than a reasonable belief and more than a possibility: Rondo at [53].
	
	
	For these reasons, I accept that Constable Smith had reasonable grounds for his suspicion that an offence had been committed.
	
	
	Although the principal challenge to the existence of reasonable grounds focused on whether there was a reasonable basis to conclude that Ms Singh had received the email directly, there seems to be another separate basis potentially available to establish reasonable grounds for a suspicion of an offence. The AVO prohibited Mr Robinson from harassing, engaging in conduct that intimidates, or deliberately interfering with the property of Ms Singh. It is not at all clear why an email of the kind sent by Mr Robinson to Ms Singh’s employee, such as appears to have been accepted here, with the consequent impact on Ms Singh as she described, does not constitute conduct that intimidates Ms Singh, harasses her or deliberately damages or interferes with her property, namely her company, in contravention of the AVO. But as this matter was not argued before me by either party, I prefer not to rely upon it to determine the matter.
	


G. Was Constable Smith satisfied that the arrest was reasonably necessary to stop a repetition of the offence?


	
	Although Constable Smith gave this as one of his reasons for the arrest, when asked in examination-in‑chief, “Did you have any reason to suspect that another breach may occur?” He said, “Not at that time, but from what the information I’d been given, I believed that a breach had occurred and that it should have been dealt with.”
	
	
	The context of this evidence indicates that “that time” to which Constable Smith made reference was a time during the morning of 22 December 2013, after he had read the documents in the folder and formed the opinion about an arrest at Mr Robinson’s supposed residence. That was several hours prior to the arrest of Mr Robinson at the police station.
	
	
	Subsequent to giving this evidence, Constable Smith was asked in cross‑examination about having given the evidence and he answered, “I don’t know if there’s going to be another breach or not.”
	
	
	There is no evidence that in the hours after Constable Smith had read the documents in the folder that he became aware of any further matters pertaining to the likelihood of Mr Robinson repeating the offence.
	
	
	Constable Smith was aware of the conduct of Mr Robinson that had led to the AVO and he was aware from Ms Singh that similar conduct, in the sending of the email that went to Ms Singh’s junk folder, had occurred after the AVO. These matters led Constable Smith to suspect a breach of the AVO. The similarity of the conduct which led to the AVO and the conduct thought to be in breach (contacting Ms Singh with intimidating material) might itself have led to a belief in Constable Smith of the likelihood of repetition of the offence.
	
	
	It was not disputed that Mr Robinson had in fact prior to 21 December 2013 breached the AVO and been charged (see State of New South Wales v Robinson [2016] NSWCA 334). Constable Smith did not claim to be aware of that breach at the time of the arrest although the email received by the employee that Constable Smith saw prior to the arrest spoke of a “breach of his Bail conditions” which, if correct, could only have been a reference to the bail conditions imposed in respect to the earlier alleged offence.
	
	
	Whether the information of the earlier alleged offence was “reasonably capable of being known” is not a question that arises under s 99(1)(b).
	
	
	Some consideration should be given to the meaning of “reasonably necessary” in s 99(1)(b). The expression was considered in Thomas v Mowbray [2007] HCA 33. In some contexts, “reasonably necessary” may refer to what is required for reasonable protection (see Thomas at [21]-[25]). In Thomas at [490], reference was made to the judgment of Gleeson CJ in Mulholland v Australian Electoral Commission (2004) 220 CLR 181 at 199-200 [39] where “necessary” meant not “essential or indispensable” but “reasonably appropriate and adapted”. The adjective “reasonably” in the phrase “reasonably necessary” tends to buttress such a construction.
	
	
	Although the term “reasonable” often imports some level of objectivity, in this context “reasonably” moderates the meaning of “necessary” and makes clear that something less than what is essential is required. Here “reasonably necessary” concerns the satisfaction of the police officer: whether the police officer is satisfied that the arrest is “reasonably necessary” or “reasonably appropriate and adapted” to stop the repetition of the offence. Thus, “reasonable” in this context does not import an objective element. It is “not what the judge thought, but what the officer thought was reasonably necessary in the circumstances” (see State of New South Wales v Randall [2017] NSWCA 88 at [38] and also [142]). The challenge to such a suspicion can only be available where the suspicion was manifestly unreasonable or “arbitrary, capricious, irrational, or not bona fide” (see Randall at [113] and [142], Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu (1999) 197 CLR 611; [1999] HCA 21 at [131]-[137]).
	
	
	Is it “rational” for Constable Smith to say he had no reason to suspect that another breach may occur and yet be satisfied that arrest was necessary for the reason of stopping another breach? It may be. There is also a possibility that Constable Smith did not have the required satisfaction. A reason to believe or reason to suspect literally concerns the basis for the belief or suspicion rather than its actuality, although that distinction was not apparent in the answer given by Constable Smith. But the two concepts – the existence of a suspicion and a simultaneous acknowledgement of having no reasons to suspect - do not sit comfortably together, at least not without further explanation from Constable Smith, and no explanation was given. This suggests that Constable Smith did not on the Sunday morning or at the time of the arrest have a belief of a possible repetition of the offence.
	
	
	The State bore the onus on this issue but gave no persuasive explanation of why the reasonable necessity of preventing a repeat of the offence became part of the belief of Constable Smith.
	
	
	All of these matters leave me unpersuaded, on the balance of probabilities, that Constable Smith was satisfied that an arrest was reasonably necessary to prevent a repetition of the offence.
	


H. Was Constable Smith satisfied that arrest was reasonably necessary to ensure that Mr Robinson appeared before the Court?


	
	The primary challenge to this asserted reason of Constable Smith was that Constable Smith had conceded that he had not determined at the time of the arrest whether he would charge Mr Robinson. Mr Robinson submitted that if, in the belief of Constable Smith, Mr Robinson might not be charged, Constable Smith could then not be satisfied that an arrest was necessary to ensure that Mr Robinson appeared in court since his appearance in court might never be necessary. Mr Robinson referred to Zaravinos v State of New South Wales [2014] NSWCA 320, where Bryson JA, with whom the other members of the Court of Appeal agreed, stated at [37]:
	


“In the present case the burden of proof that the arrest and detention were lawful fell on the defendants under the defence of justification which was attributed to them. Even if the circumstances mentioned in subs.352(2)(a) exist, the lawfulness of the arrests of Mr Zaravinos are examinable, and the arrests were not lawful unless each decision to arrest was made in good faith and for the purposes for which the power to arrest exists, that is, the purposes of bringing the person arrested before a Justice and conducting a prosecution; and not for some extraneous purpose. Arresting a person for the purpose of questioning him and investigating the circumstances of the suspected offence or of any other offence is arrest for an extraneous purpose. It is even more clearly an extraneous purpose to arrest a person as a piece of unnecessary highhanded and humiliating behaviour in circumstances in which arrest is not reasonably necessary for the effective conduct of a prosecution. The availability of Information and Summons as an alternative course, and the considerations favouring and adverse to taking that alternative course, are relevant where the validity of the exercise of the power to arrest is in question.”


	
	However, Zaravinos concerned the common law power of arrest, or at least an earlier formulation of when a police officer is empowered to arrest and concerns not at all the powers of a police officer under s 99 of LEPRA.
	
	
	Further, s 99 contemplated that an arrest may occur and may be discontinued before any appearance before a court (see s 105 and the notes to s 99(3)).
	
	
	I was also referred by Mr Robinson to Konneh v State of New South Wales (No.3) [2013] NSWSC 1424 as to when a common law right is to be found to have been abrogated by statute. I accept that clear words or necessary intendment must be apparent for the common law right of liberty to be abrogated by a statute, but it is also the case that LEPRA, s 99, most clearly regulates that common law right and creates a statutory entitlement in an officer to arrest on compliance with certain conditions.
	
	
	If Mr Robinson's construction of s 99(1)(b)(iv) were adopted, a person who was a known flight risk could not be arrested in reliance upon s 99(1)(b)(iv) unless the police officer was already persuaded that the person should be charged (or that the arrest would not be withdrawn under s 105). But a charge requires reasonable and probable cause, namely a positive belief and a sufficient (or reasonable) basis for the belief (see A v New South Wales [2007] HCA 10 at [77]), a higher obligation on the police officer to that imposed by s 99(1)(a), which requires only a suspicion on reasonable grounds.
	
	
	Consistency is an important matter in statutory construction: Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) 194 CLR 355; [1998] HCA 28 at [69], Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Zammitt [2014] NSWCA 104 at [67], Certain Lloyd's Underwriters Subscribing to Contract No IH00AAQS v Thelander (2012) 248 CLR 378 at [24]; [2012] HCA 56. It seems unlikely that s 99(1)(b)(iv) alone among the subparagraphs in s 99(1)(b), would be inoperative when s 105 was applicable. “[T]he process of construction commences with the construction of the ordinary and grammatical meaning of the words in question, having regard to their context and legislative purpose”: Rail Corporation New South Wales v Brown (2012) 82 NSWLR 318 at [39]; [2012] NSWCA 296, Zammitt at [68]. As arrest does not produce an immediate and perpetual appearance before the court the word ""appears"" in s 99(1)(b)(iv) must be read as ""appears as required"". On that construction, the application of that subparagraph is not negatived in circumstances where an appearance before a court might ultimately not be required.
	
	
	Mr Robinson submitted that it is not lawful to arrest for the purpose of investigation. I accept that this is so, not so much because that was the rule as stated in Zaravinos, but because it is not a permissible reason under s 99. It is a different question whether a person properly arrested may nevertheless be detained for the purpose of investigation, as s 109(4) permits. Here, Constable Smith was informed that Mr Robinson would not agree to attend the police station as requested, had refused to provide his place of residence, had indicated that he was homeless and that he was no longer at his noted residence. These matters all support a belief in Constable Smith of a concern about whether the person, Mr Robinson, would attend court and whether arrest was necessary for that purpose. I accept that this belief of Constable Smith was not displaced by the circumstance that Mr Robinson voluntarily attended the police station.
	


I. Was Constable Smith reasonably satisfied that an arrest was reasonable necessary because of the nature and seriousness of the offence


	
	In the earlier Robinson decision at [69], the Court of Appeal held that a breach of an AVO is a serious offence and that “social media harassment is not to be lightly dismissed”. Given the content of the email and the content of the AVO, these observations have application to a consideration of Constable Smith’s belief at the time of arrest. It may be that email contact is a lower level of contact than by personal attendance. But the content of the email, and the breach of a court order show that the sending of the email was not at the “very lowest of the criminal spectrum” as was put to Constable Smith. In any event, I do not regard Constable Smith's answer to that question, that it was ""[s]till a breaching of a court order though"", as a concession that the breach was minor.
	
	
	The primary argument on this ground advanced by Mr Robinson was that reliance upon this ground only appeared when the proposed amended defence was served in the weeks before the trial. That may be a reason to challenge Constable Smith’s evidence on the point, but the challenge was faint. At no point was it put to him that he had no belief in the seriousness of the offence at the time of arrest, nor that the reasons for arrest appearing in the initial defence (relying upon the earlier, obsolete version of s 99) represented Constable Smith’s belief at the time of the arrest. Nor does the evidence that Constable Smith thought (presumably at the time of giving evidence) that LEPRA had been amended after, rather than shortly before, the arrest have any real impact on the evidence of his belief.
	
	
	I accept that Constable Smith was satisfied at the time of the arrest that arrest was necessary because of the nature and seriousness of the offence.
	
	
	Mr Robinson also argued more generally that there were options other than arrest available and again referred to the passage in Zaravinos quoted earlier. Of course there are other options, possibilities, and it may be that, with the benefit of hindsight, another option to arrest might be seen as preferable. That view, if it existed in the Court, does not displace the test of lawfulness of the arrest contained in s 99. I accept that the requirements of s 99(1)(b)(ix) were satisfied.
	


J. Good faith and extraneous purpose of investigation


	
	Mr Robinson also argued that the State has not established that the purpose of arrest was in good faith and not for the extraneous purpose of investigation, relying upon Zaravinos. I am not persuaded that, under s 99, the State bears the onus of disproving every possible extraneous purpose. In any event, I accept that the reasons under subparas (iv) and (ix) of s 99(1)(b) were matters of which Constable Smith was satisfied at the time of the arrest as set out above.
	
	
	Constable Smith gave his reasons for the arrest, exhaustively, and a purpose of investigation was not one of them. It was not put to him that the purpose of the arrest was to investigate the offence or question Mr Robinson. While such a purpose would be improper there was nevertheless no evidence to support it. I am not persuaded that it was a purpose of Constable Smith.
	


K. Continued detention


	
	The period of detention from the time of the arrest until release was about 1 hour and 18 minutes. Mr Robinson submitted that even if the arrest was lawful, the detention was excessive. But s 99(4) and s 114 both recognise that an arrested person can be detained for the purpose of investigation. In this case, an interview was conducted with Mr Robinson’s consent, a matter which must fall within the ambit of ""investigation"" and ""investigating whether the person committed the offence"".
	
	
	Section 115 of LEPRA limits the period of detention for investigation to six hours, a much longer period than occurred here. Mr Robinson submitted that it was not established that the entire period of the detention was needed for the interview or, I infer, for other investigations, if there were any. Constable Smith did not give evidence of how long the interview took, or what were his activities during the period of detention, but he was available to be asked that by either counsel. Neither took that opportunity.
	
	
	Further, Mr Robinson could have given evidence about the period of the interview but did not.
	
	
	In these circumstances, I am not persuaded that a Jones v Dunkel inference should be drawn in favour of the defendant or in favour of the plaintiff. In my view, the period of 1 hour and 18 minutes does not seem an excessive period to prepare for and conduct an interview with Mr Robinson about the matter and potentially do other investigations. On the basis of the limited evidence available, I am satisfied that it was a reasonable period in all the circumstances and that there was not an unlawful detention of Mr Robinson during that period.
	
	
	Accordingly, for these reasons, I dismiss the claim for wrongful imprisonment.
	


L. Damages


	
	I propose to make some brief comments about damages. Mr Robinson, as indicated above, accepted that little should be awarded in respect of aggravated damages and also accepted that the period of detention for which damages should be given should not include the period of the uncertain duration of the interview (see Peter Michael Travers v The State of New South Wales [2016] NSWDC 297 and Tilse v NSW [2013] NSWDC 265).
	
	
	In Travers there was evidence of humiliation and a total period of detention somewhat longer than the present, although perhaps the period apart from the interview was not longer. In that case, an award of $2,000 plus $1,000 for aggravated and exemplary damages was made. In Tilse, an award of $2,500 was made for detention of one hour, although, in that case, the arrest was found to be lawful.
	
	
	Of course the damages in this case would vary if there was an unlawful arrest or merely if there was a period after arrest of unlawful detention. Even assuming the former, I would not award any aggravated damages. So far as exemplary damages are concerned, Mr Robinson accepted that there was no deliberate, outrageous, heavy-handed or aggressive conduct. But deprivation of liberty is not a minor matter. It would justify an award, in this case, if unlawful arrest and wrongful imprisonment were established, of $2,000 exemplary damages and $3,000 compensatory damages.
	


M. Costs


	
	Costs should follow the event.
	


N. Orders


	
	The orders of the Court are therefore:
	



	
	Judgment for the defendant.
	
	
	Plaintiff to pay the defendant's costs.

Note:    Entry of orders is dealt with in Rule 39.32 of the Federal Court Rules 2011.REASONS FOR JUDGMENTGRIFFITHS J:1    The applicant seeks judicial review of a decision of the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection.  The decision is dated 2 May 2017.  The Assistant Minister decided to cancel the applicant’s visa under s 501(2) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the Act).  The Assistant Minister stated that he reasonably suspected that the applicant did not pass the character test and that his discretion should be exercised to cancel the visa.  Summary of Minister’s reasons for visa cancellation2    The Assistant Minister provided a statement of reasons dated 2 May 2017 in support of the visa cancellation decision.  Mr Toa did not dispute the Minister’s finding that he did not pass the character test because, on 15 October 2015, Mr Toa was convicted in the local court of New South Wales of two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment for each count.  3    The Assistant Minister also set out at some length the various matters he had taken into account in determining whether to exercise his discretion to cancel Mr Toa’s visa.  In assessing the relevant consideration of protecting the Australian community and the nature of Mr Toa’s criminal conduct, the Assistant Minister noted that violent offences are viewed very seriously.  The Assistant Minister made reference to the sentencing Magistrate’s observations that Mr Toa’s conduct which gave rise to the convictions on 15 October 2015 involved “quite significant” violence, which involved both Mr Toa and his young son attacking a shopkeeper.  Mr Toa used a 1.5m length of wood and metal in attacking this victim and also punched another person, causing their lip to split and bleed.  The Assistant Minister also referred to earlier offences for which Mr Toa was convicted on 16 October 2003, relating to detaining a person in company with intent to get advantage and occasioning actual bodily harm, for which he was sentenced to four years imprisonment.  The Assistant Minister noted the District Court Judge’s sentencing remarks on that occasion that the offending was “very serious” and must objectively be viewed as “very great criminality” by members of society.  4    On the issue of risk to the Australian community, the Assistant Minister explained why he did not accept Mr Toa’s submission that he was highly unlikely to offend.  Although the Assistant Minister accepted that Mr Toa was remorseful for his past conduct, the Assistant Minister took into account that Mr Toa’s history revealed that he continued to offend after his earlier convictions, notwithstanding that there was a 13 year gap.  The Assistant Minister also noted that Mr Toa had been directed to engage in alcohol and other drugs counselling which he had been reluctant to pursue and that his parole officer had said that Mr Toa’s response to a February 2016 intensive corrections order (ICO) “has been poor”.  For these and other reasons the Assistant Minister found that there was an ongoing likelihood that Mr Toa will reoffend.  5    The Assistant Minister said that he treated the best interests of Mr Toa’s five minor children as a primary consideration.  After summarising their circumstances, the Assistant Minister concluded that it was in the best interests of those children not to cancel their father’s visa, particularly in the case of his two children who resided with him at the time of the visa cancellation decision.  6    The Assistant Minister also set out in his statement of reasons his consideration and findings in respect of expectations of the Australian community, Mr Toa’s ties to Australia and the impediments which he would face if he was removed from Australia to New Zealand.  The essence of the Assistant Minister’s ultimate decision to exercise his discretion to cancel Mr Toa’s visa are reflected in [64] to [71] of the statement of reasons:64.    I considered all relevant matters including (1) an assessment against the character test as defined by s 501(6) of the Migration Act and (2) all other information available to me, including information provided by, or on behalf of Mr TOA.65.    In considering whether or not to cancel Mr TOA's visa, I gave primary consideration to the best interests of Mr TOA's five minor children and have found that their best interests would be best served by not cancelling the visa.66.    Mr TOA has committed very serious crimes involving violence and Mr TOA and non-citizens who commit such offences should not generally expect to be permitted to remain in Australia.67.    I find that the Australian community could be exposed to great harm should Mr TOA re-offend in a similar fashion. I could not rule out the possibility of further offending by Mr TOA.  The Australian community should not tolerate any further risk of harm.68.    I found the above consideration outweighed the countervailing considerations in Mr TOA's case, including the best interests of his five minor children, impact on family members, his length of residence in Australia and the hardship he will face in resettling in New Zealand. I have also considered the length of time Mr TOA has made a positive contribution to the Australian community through his past employment and involvement with the Cook Island community and or the consequences of my decision for minor children and other family members.69.    I am cognisant that where great harm could be inflicted on the Australian community even strong countervailing considerations are generally insufficient for me not to cancel the visa. This is the case even applying a higher tolerance of criminal conduct by Mr TOA, than I otherwise would, because he has lived in Australia from aged three and made some measure of positive contribution to the community.70.    In reaching my decision I concluded that Mr TOA represents an unacceptable risk of harm to the Australian community and that the protection of the Australian community outweighed any countervailing considerations above.71.    Having given full consideration to all of these matters, I decided to exercise my discretion to cancel Mr TOA's Class TY, Subclass 444 Special Category (Temporary) visa under s 501(2) of the Migration Act.  Mr Toa’s judicial review application7    Mr Toa relied on an originating application for review which contained the following grounds (without alteration):The assistant minister has failed to give correct weight in judging my case.My first coviction in 2003 the judge was satisfied that my motives were not to harm the victim but to help her and her son [para 25] and that the assault was a resualt due to her ‘spirited resistance’ and injury being ‘not substantial’.[para 29] states that he accepts the 13 year gap between convictions suggest the ability to refrain from criminal conduct. [para 27] The judge was satisfied that i was of good character and unlikely to re-offend and had good prospect of rehabilitation.[para 28] It was accepted that i am remorseful for my past offending.[para 30] Assistant Minister states that he is ‘uncritically accepting my more recent submissions”. Obviously he has failed to give correct weight in his judgement.[para 51] Says that he holds the view of ‘higher tolerance’ yet failed to reckonise that my last charge was out of charater due to unstable accomodation and being intoxicated which was in my ‘recent submissions’ that he failed to reckonise.  8    The paragraph references in the proposed grounds of appeal are references to the Assistant Minister’s statement of reasons for the visa cancellation decision.  9    Mr Toa failed to provide any written submissions in support of his case.  At the hearing, he was invited to make oral submissions in support of his application, after the Court explained to him the difference between judicial review for jurisdictional error and a review or appeal against the merits of the Assistant Minister’s decision. 10    In his oral submissions, Mr Toa contended that the Assistant Minister’s reasons were contradictory and confusing.  Essentially, this was because Mr Toa considered that if the Assistant Minister took into account the various matters in favour of not cancelling his visa as set out in the Assistant Minister’s statement of reasons, he should not have cancelled the visa.  He referred in particular to the Assistant Minister’s findings in respect of the best interests of his children, his more recent attempts at rehabilitation and his remorse for what had occurred.  From the bar table, Mr Toa explained why he had had difficulties complying with the ICO, which largely related to the practical problems he said he experienced in fulfilling his obligations to his young children and also complying the with ICO, particularly, when the children were ill or at school.  Disposition of the application11    It is desirable to set out the relevant terms of s 501 of the Act.  Section 501(2) provided:(2)    The Minister may cancel a visa that has been granted to a person if: (a)    the Minister reasonably suspects that the person does not pass the character test; and (b)    the person does not satisfy the Minister that the person passes the character test. 12    Relevantly, the “character test” is set out in ss 501(6) and (7) (emphasis in original):Character test (6)    For the purposes of this section, a person does not pass the character test if: (a)    the person has a substantial criminal record (as defined by subsection (7)); or…Substantial criminal record (7)    For the purposes of the character test, a person has a substantial criminal record if: …(c)    the person has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 months or more; or…13    In their very terms, the grounds of review in the originating application raise issues which go to the merits of the Assistant Minister’s decision and not to its legality.  This is reflected in Mr Toa’s overarching proposition that the Assistant Minister “failed to give correct weight in judging [his] case”.  Each of the particulars to that proposition confirm that he is dissatisfied with the merits of the Assistant Minister’s decision.  None of the particulars raises any claim of jurisdictional error, nor was he able to identify any arguable jurisdictional error in his oral submissions.  The Assistant Minister had referred to each of the matters particularised in the originating application, but found that they were outweighed by other relevant matters.  Such an evaluation was within the Assistant Minister’s legal authority.  14    To the extent that Mr Toa contended that the visa cancellation decision is unreasonable in the legal sense (see Minister for Immigration and Border Protection v Li [2013] HCA 18; 249 CLR 332), having read the Assistant Minister’s reasons and taking into account Mr Toa’s oral submissions, any such claim must be rejected.  Bearing in mind that the primary focus must be on the statement of reasons provided in respect of the decision (see Minister for Immigration and Border Protection v Singh [2014] FCAFC 1; 231 FCR 437), I am not persuaded that there is no evident and intelligible justification for the relevant matters which underpin the Assistant Minister’s decision.  As the reasons disclose, the Assistant Minister engaged in a balancing exercise, which took into account various competing considerations, some of which favoured not cancelling Mr Toa’s visa while others pointed in the opposite direction.  It was ultimately a matter for evaluative judgment by the Assistant Minister, properly directed in law, to weigh these competing considerations.  I see no reviewable error in the approach which was taken by the Assistant Minister.  Conclusion15    For these reasons, the originating application must be dismissed and the applicant ordered to pay the Assistant Minister’s costs, as agreed or assessed.  I certify that the preceding fifteen (15) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Griffiths.Associate: Dated:    26 October 2017",2017-10-26 00:00:00,Federal Court of Australia
6269567,R v Bloodsworth; R v Errington (No 3) [2017] NSWSC 1484,"Judgment – EX TEMPORE


	
	An application has been made by Mr Price, who appears on behalf of the accused Bloodsworth, for a discharge of the jury on the basis of a portion of the Crown's address to the jury which has only recently been concluded.
	
	
	The Crown, towards the end of his address, reminded the jury of my direction that they were only to take into account evidence in the accused Errington's record of interview against the accused Errington and it could not be taken into account against the accused Bloodsworth.
	
	
	Notwithstanding those prefatory remarks, Mr Crown - for reasons which are not apparent - then highlighted certain passages of the recorded interview in which Mr Errington had attributed certain acts to the accused Bloodsworth. Those acts included her suggestion, according to Mr Errington, that they burn down the house after they discovered that the deceased was dead; that they lied about the allegation that the attack had occurred because the deceased had attempted to rape the accused Bloodsworth; that she held a knife to the deceased throat; and that the bleach had been used in order to protect the accused Bloodsworth and to remove any trace of her DNA as a result of having allegedly been bitten by the deceased who was trying to defend himself.
	
	
	I accept that these are matters which ought not to have been put to the jury since they were plainly inadmissible in the case against the accused Bloodsworth: s 83 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). However, I am of the view that any unfairness occasioned to the accused Bloodsworth, from the Crown's apparently ill-advised statements, can be remedied by the course which was originally proposed by Mr Price before he obtained instructions to apply for a discharge. The proposal was that the Crown be required to withdraw any suggestion from his submission that anything Mr Errington said in his recorded interview about what Ms Bloodsworth did or didn't do; say or didn't say; can be used against Ms Bloodsworth. It was also proposed that, after that explanation was given by the Crown to the jury, which should include a specific withdrawal of any such suggestion, I would reinforce the direction that the jury is not to take into account anything in that recorded interview against Ms Bloodsworth.
	
	
	While I accept that it is highly unfortunate, to say the least, that the Crown included these matters in his address, I am satisfied that they can be sufficiently remedied by the course I have just identified in order to preserve the right to a fair trial which, of course, each accused enjoys.
	
	
	In these circumstances, the application for a discharge of the jury is refused.

6269668,R v Bloodsworth; R v Errington (No 1) [2017] NSWSC 1482,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	The accused Trent Errington presently stands charged with murder by an indictment presented on 16 October 2017, which also charges the accused Rhiannon Bloodsworth with the murder of Jay Cerin between 28 August 2015 and 30 August 2015. The Crown case was that the two accused, as parties to a joint criminal enterprise to cause grievous bodily harm to Jay Cerin (the accused Errington’s half-brother), punched and hit him and hogtied him and left him, as a result of which he died. The cause of death was said to be either hogtying (which caused positional asphyxia or restraint-related stress) or hogtying in combination with blunt force head injury.
	
	
	Mr Carroll, who appeared on behalf of the accused, applied for a separate trial of the accused Errington. The application was made for the first time on 19 October 2017, the fourth day of the trial of both accused which commenced on 16 October 2017. I rejected the application after hearing argument and indicated that I would give reasons for my decision. What follows are my reasons for this decision.
	
	
	I note that, although the application was framed in terms of an application for a separate trial, it was, in substance, an application for the discharge of the jury, coupled with an application for a separate trial, since, had I been persuaded that separate trials were warranted, it would have been necessary to discharge the jury for the joint trial which commenced on 16 October 2017.
	


The basis for the application for separate trials


	
	The application for a separate trial was apparently precipitated by the Crown adducing evidence from a friend of the accused Bloodsworth, Alexander Petrovski. Mr Petrovski saw a news report to the effect that Rhiannon Bloodsworth had been charged with murder. The following exchange is taken from his examination-in-chief:
	


“Q. At this stage, what was your reaction?

A. I didn't believe it. To me, that's not the person that she is. She always very quiet, polite. She sits there with my parents and my grandparents. We sit there and have - sometimes when the kids come around on the weekends, and that fortnight, we would sit down, have pizzas, watch movies, normal time.

Q. Did they indicate online on Google how the person was killed?

A. Yeah, it did have a mini, sort of, account of what happened. I still didn't believe it. That's why I booked a visit and came and visited her at Silverwater.

Q. So you go and visit her when she was at Silverwater?

A. Yeah, straight away.

Q. First of all, did you get a call from Silverwater gaol and you accepted the call and you thought it must be Rhiannon?

A. Yep.

Q. What did she say when she first spoke to you?

A. About how she missed me, how she was innocent, and she wanted to know if I believed her.

Q. What did you say?

A. That I do.”


	
	According to Mr Petrovski the accused Bloodsworth wrote to him and told him that she loved him. He visited her in gaol at some time prior to 13 November 2015 (which was the date of his statement) and pressed her to tell him what happened. She told him that she was watching television and that whatever happened, happened in a closed room away from where she was. She also told him that she had been threatened by the accused Errington and was told that if she did not clean up and help that she would be next and her child was under threat. Rhiannon told Mr Petrovksi that she had washed clothes and tried to clean up. Mr Petrovski asked her whether there was anything which tied her to the murder to which she gave no response. Mr Petrovski’s evidence was that he also asked her whether she was “in the taxi on the way to my place to fucking rob me with that faggot” (which was a reference to a phone call she had made to him on Saturday 29 August 2015). She responded, “Hell, no, I love you.” According to Mr Petrovski she also said, “When I took off in the taxi to come to you I was alone. He happened to be on the same train.”
	
	
	Mr Carroll submitted that the evidence of Mr Petrovski had no forensic value in the Crown case against the accused Bloodsworth but was highly prejudicial to the accused Errington’s case, since it portrayed him as a violent, threatening man who had the accused Bloodsworth in his thrall and who had made a threat to harm the accused Bloodsworth and her child, if she did not assist him to wash clothes after the killing of the deceased was highly prejudicial. He submitted that matters affecting the credibility of Mr Petrovski which were contained in his statement were not led as part of his evidence in chief, including that he had been charged with manufacturing methylamphetamine. Mr Carroll submitted that the Crown “needs to engage with Mr Petrovski at least in terms of the inconsistencies in his statement”.
	
	
	Mr Carroll also instanced, as another source of prejudice arising from the trials being heard together, the evidence of Luke Duncan. Mr Carroll submitted that, although the Crown had adduced evidence from Mr Duncan’s statement to police dated 3 September 2015, it had not adduced the contents of the following paragraphs:
	


“10.   Rhiannon started getting heavy into drugs. She was shooting up ice and using almost every day. When she was on ice she would be uncontrollable. She would start fights and arguments with me and people who were around her. She would get violent. I have seen her punch other people when she was on ice and would also attack me sometimes.

. . .

18.   We drove back to my place. Over the next couple of weeks Rhiannon stayed on and off with me. She started to tell me about the two brothers. She said, ‘They're my two bitches’. ‘They do what I tell them to do’.”


	
	Mr Carroll submitted that the Crown appeared, on the basis of Mr Petrovski’s evidence, to be making a positive case of the accused Bloodsworth’s good character. Mr Carroll also referred to an allegation in a further statement made by Mr Duncan that he was being pressured to change his statement as a result of a threat which was alleged to have been made on behalf of the accused Bloodsworth. That further statement was not tendered on the application and I understand that some material relating to the application has been the subject of a claim for public interest immunity. I have not been asked to adjudicate on the claim.
	
	
	Mr Carroll said that the prejudice to his client could not be cured by a direction because there was, in effect, no contradictor to expose the unreliability of Mr Petrovski’s evidence as he could not cross-examine Mr Petrovski, as what Mr Petrovski said (about what the accused Bloodsworth said to Mr Petrovski) was not admissible against the accused Errington. Mr Carroll argued that, were he to cross-examine Mr Petrovski, the jury might get the incorrect impression that his evidence was admissible against the accused Errington.
	
	
	Mr Crown confirmed that it was no part of the Crown’s case that the accused Bloodsworth was of good character and noted the evidence which established that she was a regular illicit drug user. The Crown confirmed that it relied on the statement made by the accused Bloodsworth to Mr Petrovski as an admission (as to her presence in the unit at the time of the acts which led to the deceased’s death). It also relied on her statement to Mr Petrovski (as to her alleged absence from the room where the acts were committed and her involvement in cleaning up as a result of the threats alleged to have been made to her) as a lie amounting to a consciousness of guilt. I note that there was evidence of her telling others prior to her arrest on 31 August 2015 that the deceased had been attacked as he had tried to rape her, which was accepted by her counsel to be a “story” which was not true.
	


Consideration


	
	The starting point is the presumption that where co-offenders are alleged to be engaged in a joint criminal enterprise, they should be tried jointly: see the authorities cited in R v Fernando [1999] NSWCCA 66 at [199]–[212].  In Webb & Hay v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 41; [1994] HCA 30, Toohey J, with whom Mason CJ and McHugh J agreed, said at 89 (citations omitted):
	


“There are of course dangers for an accused in a joint trial by reason of the admission of evidence which would not be admitted at the trial of one accused. That risk must be obviated by express and careful directions to the jury as to the use they may make of the evidence so far as it concerns each accused.

In the end the critical question before an appellate court in these circumstances is whether, by reason of the joint trial, there has been a substantial miscarriage of justice or, put another way, whether improper prejudice has been created against an accused.

In the present case adequate directions were given by the trial judge. It is true that Webb did not give evidence and was therefore not subject to cross-examination, though the jury heard his statements to the police implicating Hay. But, as King CJ observed: ‘That is a common feature of a joint trial and does not of itself render separate trials necessary.’”


	
	I was satisfied, on the basis of the Crown’s assurance and in light of the considerable unchallenged evidence adduced at the trial of the accused Bloodsworth’s illicit drug use, that it is no part of the Crown case that the accused Bloodsworth was of good character. The evidence of Mr Petrovski, which was only admissible against the accused Bloodsworth, was led by the Crown to prove a statement made by her to him, which the Crown will contend was a lie amounting to a consciousness of guilt. Thus, although the statement was self-serving and sought to attribute the whole of the blame for the killing of the deceased on the co-accused Errington, the Crown led it for the purpose of establishing the guilt of the accused Bloodsworth.
	
	
	The potential for prejudice to the co-accused Errington can, in my view, adequately be dealt with by a direction to the jury that the evidence of Mr Petrovski is admissible only against the accused Bloodsworth and not against the co-accused. The need for such a direction has arisen in respect of various pieces of evidence, including the recorded interview given by the accused Errington and statements made by each accused to various third parties, to which the co-accused was not privy.
	
	
	The omission from the Crown case of certain paragraphs in the statement of Mr Duncan is a separate issue. In one sense, the grievance raised by Mr Carroll is dealt with by the Crown’s assurance that it is no part of the Crown case that the accused Bloodsworth is of good character. However, there is a further reason why this omission (if it be such) does not constitute a reason for ordering separate trials.
	
	
	Evidence to be led by the Crown from a witness statement can be the subject of discussion between counsel before the witness is called. If there is a disagreement about what evidence is to be led, this can be raised with the trial judge in the absence of the jury. It was plain to Mr Carroll at the end of Mr Duncan’s examination in chief that the Crown did not propose to lead paragraphs [10] and [18] from Mr Duncan’s statement. In those circumstances it was open to Mr Carroll to signal that he wished to raise something in the absence of the jury. Had he done so, I could have heard argument as to why the Crown had decided not to lead that evidence as well as any objection to that evidence from Mr Price, who appeared for the accused Bloodsworth. The omission could have been remedied by the Crown leading the evidence or, if an objection by Mr Price had been upheld, at least the point would have been ventilated. While I appreciate that Mr Carroll did not want, as he put it, to give the jury a “mixed message” by objecting to the material led from Mr Duncan in circumstances where the evidence led was not, in any event, admissible against his client, he was obliged to take what course would protect his client’s interests at the time but raising it with me so that I could have dealt with it in the absence of the jury.
	
	
	It is not necessary to express a view as to the admissibility of these paragraphs, and inappropriate that I do so in the absence of argument. It is sufficient to say that they were arguably admissible as background evidence to counter any inference that the co-accused Bloodsworth was, by reason of her age and size, incapable of asserting herself against men with whom she was, or had been, in an intimate relationship.
	
	
	By remaining silent and objecting after Mr Duncan had come and gone from the witness box, Mr Carroll acquiesced in the forensic decision made by the Crown not to adduce the contents of [10] and [18]. An accused is, generally speaking, bound by the conduct of his or her counsel:  R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 at 684–685 (Gleeson CJ, McInerney J agreeing).
	
	
	I was not satisfied that the accused Errington could not have a fair trial if his trial is heard jointly with that of the co-accused Bloodsworth. Indeed, I regard it as very much in the interests of justice that the two accused be tried together in light of the way the Crown put its case against each of them. Accordingly the application for the accused Errington to be tried separately was refused.

6269669,R v Bloodsworth; R v Errington (No 4) [2017] NSWSC 1485,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	On 25 October 2016, after all counsel had addressed but before I had commenced my summing up, Mr Price, who appeared on behalf of the accused Bloodsworth, sought the following direction:
	


“If you find that there was no agreement between Ms Bloodsworth and Mr Errington to commit the crime as charged, you must acquit the accused, Ms Bloodsworth, of murder and manslaughter.”


	
	The giving of the direction in those terms was not opposed by the Crown but it was opposed by Mr Carroll, who appeared on behalf of the accused Errington.
	
	
	The basis of Mr Price’s request was that the Crown had put its case against both accused on the basis of joint criminal enterprise and that there was no evidence that the accused Bloodsworth had actually done any physical acts that caused the death of the deceased.
	
	
	Mr Carroll opposed the giving of the direction and contended it had a tendency to cause an imbalance between the two accused which was both unwarranted and prejudicial to the accused Errington. He submitted that the only basis on which it could be concluded that the accused Errington was the one who had done the physical acts, or at least some of them, that had caused the death of the deceased, was the admissions he made in his recorded interview and to Mr Barbara. He submitted that as this evidence was not admissible against (or in favour of) the accused Bloodsworth, it would be wrong to insinuate that she could obtain the benefit of those admissions by giving such a direction.
	
	
	At the conclusion of argument I refused to give the direction but indicated that I would revisit the question at the conclusion of my summing up, if it was still pressed. Before I invited the jury to commence its deliberations, I asked counsel if there was any matter in my summing up that they wished to correct or anything further which they wished me to add. Mr Price reiterated his request for a direction in the form set out above. Mr Carroll continued to oppose the direction being given and the Crown also indicated that it opposed the direction being given (which was a change from its earlier lack of opposition, which I take to have been brought about by Mr Carroll’s submissions). I refused to give the direction sought by Mr Price and indicated that I would provide reasons for my decision later. What follows are my reasons for refusing to give the direction sought by Mr Price.
	


The Crown case and the respective cases of the two accused


	
	The notice of prosecution case filed and served pursuant to s 142 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) attached the Crown Case Statement. It concluded:
	


“The Crown case is that both accused were part of a joint criminal enterprise the object of which was to inflict at least grievous bodily harm on the deceased.”


	
	The Crown in its opening did not refer at all to joint criminal enterprise. It merely foreshadowed, by way of summary extracted effectively verbatim from the Crown Case Statement, what the evidence would disclose. At the end of the fifth day of the trial, 20 October 2017, when almost all of the Crown evidence had been adduced, I raised with the Crown how it put its case against the accused Bloodsworth in order that I could prepare my summary up of the Crown case in the summing up on that basis. Mr Crown responded (tr. 381):
	


“CROWN PROSECUTOR: Joint criminal enterprise. And in relation to that, an unspoken agreement can arise obviously between them during the course of the incident and indeed by simply being present. But we say there is a joint criminal enterprise between them and that can be inferred from the circumstances.”


	
	In the absence of the jury, also at the end of the fifth day, Mr Price summarised the accused Bloodsworth’s case as follows (tr. 383):
	


“That there was no joint criminal enterprise, no agreement, no actions in accordance with it leading up to and at the time of expiry of the deceased. Her actions were purely after discovery. We say there is equal inference in relation to that and all her criminality can be sheeted home to her panic and helping her and her boyfriend get away.

There is no evidence of any direct role of hers admissible against her, any act of violence, any tying up or any assault. And there is no direct evidence against her of any omission on her part that would have resulted in the death. We say there is simply no intent by her to commit grievous bodily harm by way of her actions or by joint criminal enterprise.”


	
	The first time the jury heard the expression “joint criminal enterprise” was in the Crown closing address, when the Crown said, at tr. 457:
	


“The accused, that is both accused here, have been charged with the murder of the deceased, Jay Cerin. The accused are tried jointly on the basis of what's called joint criminal enterprise. Where two or more people carry out a joint criminal enterprise, each is responsible for the acts of the other in carrying out that crime. I will give you an example. Say a bank robbery, two people decide to commit a bank robbery, an armed bank robbery. One is the getaway driver. He stays outside. The other fellow goes in with a gun and robs the tellers, gets the money and comes out, and the getaway driver drives him away. In relation to that crime, which would be armed robbery, both accused are equally guilty of that offence. Here what the Crown says is that that principle of joint criminal enterprise says that both of these accused are guilty of murder.

A matter for you, members of the jury, entirely; but in relation to the evidence of what occurred at this unit with Jay Cerin, there is no doubt that he was tied up, trussed up like a hog. You will see that in the photographs, which are very graphic. There is no doubt that he was hit around the head, that's what they call blunt force injuries, because he had bruising all over his face and head. There is no doubt he was stabbed in the arm, which I will come back to later, but you will find that there is no doubt that that occurred. There is no doubt he was moved into a bedroom at the rear of the house and left there. There is also no doubt that later when they came back he was dead. I will refer to medical evidence in relation to that, as to how long he would have lived. The degradation of this man is, you might think, members of the jury, of the highest order. That the accused were showing a disdain for the welfare of this man is obvious.”

[Emphasis added.]


	
	The Crown relevantly continued at tr. 459:
	


“In relation to that hogtying, if you then look at photograph 182. Unfortunately, 181 shows the full extent of the hogtying. They have tied his ankles, they have pulled his legs up and they have tied his legs, pulled up, to his wrists. For whatever reason that was done, as far as Professor Duflou is concerned, that contributed significantly to his death. And that's what the Crown has to prove. The Crown has to prove that what they did was the significant cause of death. Not the only cause death, but the significant cause of death. You will have no doubt, members of the jury, I expect, to find that that occurred.”

[Emphasis added.]


	
	At tr. 461, the Crown said:
	


“Now, a person may be guilty of murder notwithstanding that the immediate cause of death is the act of the co-accused, in other words, if you find that Errington did most of this and Bloodsworth assisted him, she is equally guilty of murder, going back to the principle of joint criminal enterprise and the bank robber.”

[Emphasis added.]


	
	Before the Crown finished its closing address, I provided to the jury, after consultation with counsel, a document (MFI 18) in which I set out the elements of murder and manslaughter germane to the trial. Of present significance, the elements for murder in the document were set out as follows:
	


“1. The crime of murder has been committed by the accused if the Crown has established beyond reasonable doubt each of the following two elements:

(1)   that it was the deliberate act of the accused (either individually or pursuant to a joint criminal enterprise) that caused the death of the deceased; and

(2)   that the act of the accused which caused death was done with an intention to kill the deceased; or to inflict grievous bodily harm (which means really serious harm) upon him; or with reckless indifference to the deceased’s life.”

[Emphasis added.]


	
	All counsel accepted that this document accurately set out the elements of murder in the present case (where it was agreed that no issue of provocation or self-defence need be raised).
	
	
	Mr Carroll addressed the jury in accordance with his opening and submitted that, while the accused Errington accepted moral and physical responsibility for the deceased’s death, he ought be acquitted of murder as he did not intend to cause grievous bodily harm and acquitted of manslaughter because hog-tying, the cause of death, neither carried with it an appreciable risk of serious injury, nor would a reasonable person in the position of the accused have realised that the act causing death carried an appreciable risk of serious injury. Mr Price addressed the jury in accordance with what he had foreshadowed on 20 October 2017 in the absence of the jury.
	
	
	In the summing up I explained the principles of joint criminal enterprise, which largely restated the principles as set out in R v Tangye (1997) 92 A Crim R 545 at 556-557, which were cited with approval by McHugh J in Osland v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 316; [1998] HCA 75 at [73] and have been accepted generally since as the guiding principles. I referred in the summary of evidence to the forensic evidence which detected the accused Errington’s DNA on the ties by which the deceased was hogtied and on the pot which also contained the DNA of the deceased, which was said to be what caused the blunt force injuries to the deceased’s head.
	
	
	I also referred to various admissions made by each accused. In particular I referred to admissions made by the accused Bloodsworth which suggested that she was liable as a principal for the acts which caused the death of the deceased, which included the following:
	



	
	The evidence that at some time during the night of Friday 28 August 2015 and the morning of Saturday 29 August 2015 the accused phoned Dennis Rigley (a former partner and continuing associate) and said, “I fucked up. I’m really scared. I think he’s dead.” Mr Rigley said, “I don’t want to hear about this shit” and hung up. [Emphasis added.]
	
	
	The further evidence of Mr Rigley that at some time on the weekend Mr Rigley collected Ms Bloodsworth from the 7-Eleven store in Kingswood and took her back to his place. She told him, “I fucked up.” According to Mr Rigley the accused Bloodsworth showed him her phone, the screen of which was black. She played the audio on the phone. Mr Rigley heard a male voice, with a menacing tone, saying, “I told you to get something to put in his fucking mouth”. According to Mr Rigley, Rhiannon turned the phone off and asked him what she should do and he responded, “Go to the cops.” She did not do so.
	
	
	The evidence that the accused Bloodsworth rang Luke Duncan (a former partner and continuing associate), mentioned “187” (apparently a code used in the United States for murder) and said, “You helped your cousin.” Mr Duncan explained in his evidence that one of his cousins had been “done” for murder. The past and continuing association between the accused Bloodsworth and Mr Duncan was such as to ground an inference that the accused Bloodsworth was herself implicated in a murder and considered herself to be entitled to call on Mr Duncan’s help as she found herself in the same predicament as Mr Duncan’s cousin.
	
	
	The evidence that the accused Bloodsworth rang her sister, Ms Stecum, at 5.19pm on Saturday 29 August 2015, mentioned code “187” for murder and said: “They tied him up and poured bleach down his throat.” The use of the plural “they” implied that it was more than one person who tied the deceased up. As there was no suggestion that anyone other than the two accused were present in the deceased flat when the acts of tying occurred, this statement could be regarded as an admission that she was involved in tying up the deceased with the accused Errington.
	
	
	The evidence of Leiah Munnings (the partner of the accused Errington’s best friend, Chris Barbara) that the accused Errington had said, in the presence of the accused Bloodsworth, that he was looking at “40-50 years”, to which Ms Bloodsworth responded that she was the one looking at “affray”. The jury could infer that the use of the word affray, which connotes the use of physical violence, amounted to an admission of the accused Bloodsworth’s physical involvement in the acts that caused the deceased’s death.
	
	
	The evidence of Terrence Fensom (a friend of the accused Bloodsworth) that at some stage over the weekend, the accused Bloodsworth rang Mr Fensom and told him in this call that the night they got kicked out, “they” had stabbed and bashed Trent’s brother because he had tried to rape her. Rhiannon told Mr Fensom that the brother had died as a result of the stabbing and bashing. She said that Trent had also poured bleach down his throat. She said to Mr Fensom, “I might as well tell you because he’s yelling it out anyway”. Although Mr Fensom accepted, in cross-examination from Mr Price that she said “he (meaning Trent) bashed and stabbed him to death”, it would be open to the jury to accept Mr Fensom’s evidence in chief that she had spoken in terms of the plural.
	



	
	For present purposes, the only material differences between the positions of the two accused were:
	



	
	some forensic evidence implicated the accused Errington, but not the accused Bloodsworth, in that his DNA and that of the deceased was found on the pot with which it is alleged the deceased was hit and the ties by which the deceased was bound; and
	
	
	the accused Errington’s admissions as to his involvement were generally more explicit and were made not only to third parties with whom he was associated but also to investigating police in the course of the recorded interview, whereas the accused Bloodsworth’s admissions as to her involvement were made to third party associates only and were, in some respects, less explicit as to her own involvement.
	



	
	The Crown’s use of the plural and the passive in its closing address was consistent with its submission that both accused were parties to a joint criminal enterprise. It did not at any time resile from the proposition that both accused had played an active part in the killing of the deceased. The acceptance by all counsel of my formulation of the elements of the offences is also significant in that I expressed the element in terms of the requirement that “it was the deliberate act of the accused (either individually or pursuant to a joint criminal enterprise) that caused the death of the deceased”.
	
	
	Joint criminal enterprise is a form of principal liability and is to be distinguished from the so-called derivative liability of accessories before and after the fact: Osland v The Queen at [72]-[73] (McHugh J).
	
	
	If I had acceded to Mr Price’s request for a direction in the terms set out above, it would have created an imbalance between the two accused which was not warranted by the way the Crown put its case against them, or by the evidence. As referred to above, there was evidence which implicated each of the accused in the acts causing death, whether by admissions (in the case of both accused) or forensic evidence (in the case of the accused Errington). A giving of such a direction would have tended to create unfairness to the accused Errington and carried with it the (false) implication that the jury could use his admissions (to third parties and in his recorded interview) in favour of the accused Bloodsworth. The prohibition on the tender of admissions by one accused against another in s 83 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) is fundamental: see Sio v The Queen (2016) 259 CLR 47; [2016] HCA 32 at [60] (French CJ, Bell, Gageler, Keane and Gordon JJ). The need to maintain and emphasise the importance of the direction that the jury cannot use such evidence, which is admissible as an admission against one accused, in the case of the other accused, is critical to the fair trial of each, in circumstances where the trials are heard together.
	
	
	For these reasons I refused to make the direction sought by Mr Price on behalf of the accused Bloodsworth.

KIEFEL CJ, GAGELER AND KEANE JJ.   Each of the applicants for leave to 
appeal was charged with offences which arose out of an incident of civil disorder 
that occurred in the vicinity of the Parliament of Nauru on 16 June 2015.   

 
On  25 November  2016,  following  pleas  of  guilty  in  the  District  Court  of 
Nauru to various offences by the applicants, they were each sentenced to terms of 
imprisonment.    Mr Cecil  and  Mr Jeremiah  were  ordered  to  serve  a  total  of 
three months'  imprisonment  and  Mr Kepae  was  ordered  to  serve  a  total  of  six 
months' imprisonment. 

 
The  Director  of  Public  Prosecutions  of  Nauru  brought  an  appeal  under 
s 3(3) of the Appeals Act 1972 (Nr) (""the Appeals Act""), in which it was alleged 
that the sentences were manifestly lenient and that there was a disparity between 
the  sentences  and  the  penalty  imposed  for  another  related  offence.    The 
applicants  cross-appealed  on  a  number  of  grounds,  including  the  ground  that 
their sentences were manifestly excessive. 

 
On  2 May  2017,  the  Supreme Court  of  Nauru  (Khan ACJ)  upheld  the 
appeals brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions, dismissed the applicants' 
appeals and substituted its own sentences for the sentences passed by the District 
Court.    The  total  period  of  imprisonment  for  Mr Jeremiah  and  Mr Kepae  was 
22 months and for Mr Cecil, 14 months. 

An  appeal  to  this Court  under  the  Nauru  (High  Court Appeals)  Act  1976 
 
(Cth) from the exercise or purported exercise by the Supreme Court of Nauru of 
its appellate jurisdiction requires the leave of this Court. 

 
The Director of Public Prosecutions in the applications for leave to appeal 
in this Court has conceded that the Supreme Court of Nauru ""did not state in its 
reasons that it found error"" and ""erroneously concluded that it was not required to 
find error affecting the sentence imposed by the District Court of Nauru"".  These 
concessions are properly made. 

 
The Supreme Court's error, in assuming that it could proceed to substitute 
its  own  sentence  without  identifying  any  error  on  the  part  of  the  District  Court, 
appears to have been based upon two factors.  The first was the entitlement of the 
Director to bring an appeal against sentence under s 3(3) of the Appeals Act.  The 
second  was  that  s 14(4)  of  the  Appeals  Act  gave  the  Supreme Court  an 
unconstrained  discretion  on  appeal  to  substitute  a  sentence  for  that  imposed  by 
the District Court. 

 
It  is  to  be  inferred  that  the  combination  of  these  factors  led  the 
Supreme Court  to  believe  that  nothing  more  was  required  for  it  to  be  able  to 
substitute sentences which it considered to be appropriate in the circumstances.

Section 3(3)  of 

 
the  Director  of  Public 
 
Prosecutions to bring an appeal to the Supreme Court.  It says nothing about the 
powers of that Court on appeal, or when its discretion to substitute a sentence is 
enlivened.    Section 14(4)  of  the  Appeals  Act  provides  that,  at  the  hearing  of  an 
appeal, the Supreme Court: 

the  Appeals  Act  permits 

""may, if it thinks that a different sentence should have been passed, quash 
the sentence passed by the District Court and pass in substitution therefor 
such other sentence, whether more or less severe, which the District Court 
could lawfully have passed as it thinks ought to have been passed ..."" 

There is nothing in the Appeals Act to suggest that the discretion given by 
 
this  provision  is  to  be  exercised  other  than  by  reference  to  the  well-established 
principles  relating  to  appellate  review  of  the  exercise  by  a  lower  court  of  its 
sentencing  discretion.    The  discretion  to  substitute  a  sentence  under  the 
Appeals Act  only  arises  where  the  appellate  court  finds  error  in  the  decision  of 
the court below.  It is not enough that the appellate court considers that it would 
have taken a different course, had it been in the position of the sentencing judge.  
It  must  appear  that  some  error  was  made  by  the  sentencing  judge  in  exercising 
the discretion1. 

 
An  appellate  court  must  not  intervene  unless  it  identifies  an  error  of  law 
amounting  to  a  failure  of  the  sentencing  judge  properly  to  exercise  their 
sentencing  discretion.    The  Supreme Court  did  not  in  any  way  address  this 
question. 

 
Despite conceding that the Supreme Court wrongly concluded that it was 
not required to find error affecting the District Court's exercise of its sentencing 
discretion,  the  Director  of  Public  Prosecutions  submits  that  it  is  nevertheless  to 
be inferred that the Supreme Court considered that the sentences imposed by the 
District Court were manifestly inadequate and that it has not been shown that the 
Supreme Court's conclusion in that regard was based on an error of principle. 

 
The  only  inference  that  may  be  drawn  from  the  reasons  of  the 
Supreme Court  is  that  the  Supreme Court  considered  that,  if  it  were  sentencing 
afresh, it would give much higher sentences, as it did.

The  authority  of  the  Supreme Court  to  substitute  a  sentence  is  not 
 
enlivened by such a view.  Its power to do so is only engaged if it expressed its 
satisfaction that the discretion given to the District Court had miscarried2. 

 

There will be a grant of leave in each of the matters.   

 
In  advance  of  the  hearing  of  the  applications  for  leave,  the  parties  were 
asked  by  the  Senior  Registrar  of  the Court  whether,  if  leave  were  granted,  they 
would  seek  to  file  further  submissions  on  the  appeal.    The  parties  advised 
the Court  that,  in  the  event  the Court  allows  the  applications  for  leave,  they 
would not seek to file further submissions on appeal, other than on the question 
of  costs.    They  are  agreed  that  in  those  circumstances  the  appropriate  orders  in 
each matter would be:

Leave to appeal be granted. 

The appeal be heard instanter.

The  appeals  to  the  Supreme Court  of  Nauru  by  the  appellant  and 
the  respondent  be  remitted  to  the  Supreme Court  of  Nauru, 
differently constituted, for hearing according to law. 

 

There will be orders accordingly. 

The applicants seek their costs of the appeal.  Section 26 of the Judiciary 
 
Act  1903  (Cth)  provides  that  this Court  may  order  costs  in  all  matters  coming 
before  it.    The Court's  discretion  in  relation  to  costs  is  informed  by  s 43  of  the 
Appeals  Act,  which  provides  that  the  High  Court  may  award  costs  in  criminal 
appeals.  There will be a further order that the applicants have their costs of the 
appeals.

Introduction


	
	The plaintiff brings an application for leave to make five amendments to the statement of claim in these proceedings. Two of these, in relation to the plaintiff’s claim for defamation, are opposed by the defendants.
	
	
	The circumstances giving rise to the application are as follows. The original statement of claim, drafted by the plaintiff herself, sought remedies for six causes of action, one of which is a claim for “defamation, coercion and corruption”, arising out of a series of actions and statements asserted to have been carried out or made by the three defendants. On the first return date in the general list, the defendants foreshadowed an application for summary dismissal of her claim on the basis that no identifiable cause of action was pleaded. Orders for pro bono assistance were made by the Registrar on 11 November 2016 (and again on 9 December 2016) and Mr Robison of counsel was appointed.
	
	
	Mr Robison successfully opposed the defendants’ application for summary dismissal of the pleadings on 24 March 2017. He also prepared an amended statement of claim (filed on 27 March 2017) which reduced the plaintiff’s six claims down to two causes of action, namely a claim for defamation arising from a “complaint” which was made “in 2015” and a separate claim for assault for 14 incidents involving the third defendant. As a result of the defamation claim being identified, the proceedings were transferred to the Defamation List.
	
	
	The defendants again challenged the amended claim for defamation, on the basis that it still failed to meet the requirements of r 14.30 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (“UCPR”). They identified the following defects:
	



	
	The pleading referred to “a complaint” made “in 2015” which was not annexed, although the plaintiff must have drawn specific documents to the attention of her pro bono counsel as the contents of one such document are repeated in fairly close detail.
	
	
	The pleading failed to differentiate between the defendants, or to set out the basis upon which each of them was asserted to be a publisher, or to identify the publication or publications each of them was asserted to have made, individually or in concert.
	
	
	The imputations required redrafting.
	



	
	Another pro bono counsel, Mr Potter, has redrafted the defamation claim. The plaintiff now seeks leave to amend the previous pleading filed on 27 March 2017. The plaintiff initially also sought leave to bring an application for an extension of time (s 14B Limitation Act 1969 (NSW)) but, as is noted in paragraph 6 below, this has now been abandoned in favour of an application for orders under s 65 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) to replace the existing defendants with a proposed new defendant and to replace the reference to a “complaint” made “in 2015” to the contents of a complaint file produced on subpoena.
	
	
	The nature of the plaintiff’s claim for leave to amend has changed substantially during the course of case management and argument. The issues before me for determination may be summarised as follows:
	



	
	The plaintiff seeks to substitute the name of Ms Vanessa Madunic (in relation to the defamation claim only) pursuant to s 65 for that of the three defendants in relation to the defamation claim, although she intends to continue the claim for the series of assaults against the third defendant. She no longer brings an extension of time to commence proceedings.
	
	
	The plaintiff also brings an application to add Annexure A (pages 1 to 69 of the proposed pleading) as the matter complained of and to replead the plaintiff’s imputations.
	
	
	The plaintiff also seek leave (not opposed) to join South Eastern Sydney Local Health District as the second defendant in relation to the assault claims.
	
	
	The plaintiff also seek leave (which is consented to) to change her surname from “Naicker” to “Clarke”. I have changed the name on the judgment I am handing down but, as she is referred to as “Naicker” in all the documents, including the pleadings, I have retained the name “Naicker” in the judgment. Appropriate orders will need to be entered on JusticeLink as well as a fresh statement of claim incorporating this name and the changes to particulars (see 6(e) below).
	
	
	The plaintiff also seek leave (not opposed) to change particulars (k) and (l) in relation to the assault claim and to add paragraph 11.
	



	
	The plaintiff also sought to bring a notice of motion for hearing today in relation to the adequacy of production of material by a third party. As the notice of motion was filed on 3 October 2017 and served on 4 October 2017, I did not consider that was sufficient time for the third party (who was not present in court) to be represented and I have accordingly made orders standing over that notice of motion set out in the date in the orders below.
	
	
	This history of unsatisfactory pleadings, prior amendments, changes in position by the plaintiff on legal and factual issues and late applications has created confusion and complexity. I am indebted to both counsel for endeavouring to simplify the issues, but it is still necessary to set out the background to this application in detail.
	


The first Statement of Claim, filed on 15 August 2016


	
	As noted above, the plaintiff’s claim was originally for six causes of action by the plaintiff in the Statement of Claim she drafted for herself. The pleading is confusing, as it refers to administrative law, constructive dismissal, “defamation”, coercion, corruption and makes a general claim that the plaintiff’s “name was tarnished”.
	
	
	The relevant details appear to be those set out in the sixth paragraph of the Statement of Claim (Exhibit D), describe the circumstances in which the plaintiff was stood down from her position as a nurse:
	


“I was a manager of the operating suite after hours for the Royal Hospital for Women Theatres Amalgamated, and then I was provided with a new contract to come onto the [eligible] (9 May 2013). The environment was Recovery. I am a theatre trained nurse from ACU (2005). Julie Herrick premeditated [sic] with Sue Dale and Virginia King how, what and why my career pathway was to be attacked. The Royal Hospital for Women was highly toxic. Policies plus protocols plus guidelines were not being followed. Patients were overdosed by Virginia King and Julie Herrick was sic] not responding to Sue Dale falsifying [illegible] for patients who were totally unconscious.”


	
	Judging by the other information in this pleading, at least some of the unidentified defamatory publications by the defendants occurred at a period at or before the time when the plaintiff was stood down from her position, namely on 5 May 2015. They could have been made afterwards as well. The absence of dates creates difficulties.
	
	
	The claims against the three defendants Julie Herrick, Susan Dale and Virginia King, are not limited to defamation. References to the identity of any “defendant” in the pleading can be summarised as follows:
	



	
	In paragraph 2, there is a reference to the “respondent” bringing about the plaintiff’s “constructive dismissal”, which is followed by a claim of “defamation, coercion and corruption (no deed was signed) – authority bodies mentioned funds to be returned. Name was tarnished”.
	
	
	There is also a reference to “The Royal Hospital for Women” in relation to an asserted claim for discrimination on the basis of disability, followed by a complaint of a process which was “corrupt and specifically orchestrated to undermine my reputation and taint my professionalism”, although without identifying those involved.
	
	
	The plaintiff complains, in the context of the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth), about “repeated” and “unreasonable” conduct by Julie Herrick, Susan Dale and Virginia King in paragraph 4;
	
	
	There are references in paragraphs 5 and 6 to the plaintiff being repeatedly bullied, harassed, victimised and then dismissed after raising health and safety complaints and to the specific conduct of Julie Herrick, Susan Dale and Virginia King (in paragraph 6).
	



	
	No specific publication by any of the three named defendants was identified, let alone attached, and no imputations were pleaded. No date(s) of publication was/were given, although the plaintiff appears, from this pleading, to blame the three named defendants for a campaign of complaint and vilification leading to her being sacked at a hearing in 2015, suggestive of a date or dates before that time for such publications. In those circumstances, it is hard to see how the pleadings in this claim this could amount to an actionable claim for defamation at all: Emmerton v University of Sydney [1970] 2 NSWR 633.
	


The Amended Statement of Claim filed on 27 March 2017


	
	The Amended Statement of Claim drafted by Mr Robison is a very different document. It describes the defendants as follows:
	


“3. At all material times the defendants were employed as nurses by the South Eastern Sydney Local Health District (or its predecessor entities) at the Royal Hospital for Women.”


	
	The Amended Statement of Claim then goes on to state that “[i]n 2015, the defendants published, or caused to be published, a complaint to the to the [sic] Nursing & Midwifery Council of New South Wales, “the matter complained of”.”
	
	
	This is followed by a series of imputations which appear to have been drawn more or less directly from Exhibit B, a confidential letter addressed to the plaintiff which sets out that the Nursing & Midwifery Council was considering information provided to them from Ms Madunic, Acting Director of Operations, Royal Hospital for Women, dated 21 August 2015, which attaches a Section 150 Proceedings, Health Practitioner Regulation National Law (NSW) “background document”.
	
	
	That document contains two important pieces of information. First, it refers to a number of the allegations identified in the imputations, such as the contents of paragraph 28, each of which mirrors the language of the imputations. The pleaded imputations are as follows:
	



	
	That the plaintiff was incompetent as a nurse;
	
	
	That the plaintiff required supervision as a nurse;
	
	
	That the plaintiff presented a risk to the health and safety of patients;
	
	
	That the health and safety of patients necessitated that the plaintiff have restrictions placed upon her;
	
	
	That the health and safety of patients necessitated that the plaintiff undergo additional training;
	
	
	That the plaintiff had a mental health disorder;
	
	
	That the plaintiff’s performance as a nurse was below acceptable standards including in relation to:
	



	
	Communication regarding clinical handover;
	
	
	Fabrication of patient observations;
	
	
	Unprofessional communication with staff;
	
	
	Failure to receive constructive feedback;
	
	
	Inability to calculate correct drug dosages;
	
	
	Inappropriate oxygen administration.
	



	
	Second, the complaint document clearly refers to Ms Madunic by name as the person formally bringing the complaint to the relevant authority.
	
	
	Despite the clear references to Ms Madunic in the documents provided to the plaintiff in September 2015, the claim as pleaded was continued against the three named defendants who, as is noted above, are referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 as being employees of the South Eastern Sydney Local Health District and as having caused to be published or published the relevant complaint.
	
	
	A significant lacuna in the amended statement of claim is the absence of the matter complained of, which is neither attached nor described, beyond a reference to it having been published “in 2015”, according to paragraph 4. (As noted above, apart from a reference to the plaintiff having been stood down for a period which ended on 5 May 2015, there were no references in the original Statement of Claim to the date of publication.)
	
	
	Does the reference to a complaint made “in 2015” identify the documents set out in the confidential letter addressed to the plaintiff (Exhibit B in these proceedings), or to the matter complained of attached to the proposed new pleading, or to the complaints about the plaintiff made by others leading up to the bringing of that complaint, such as the three named defendants?
	
	
	The first difficulty for the plaintiff is that the Amended Statement of Claim drafted by Mr Robison continued the claim against the three named fellow nurses, even though he and the plaintiff had access to the complaint documents upon which the plaintiff now wishes to sue. Reading Mr Robison’s pleadings, the subject matter of the claim appears to be these women’s underlying complains, and not the actual complaint lodged by Ms Madunic which repeated this information.
	
	
	The second difficulty is that the matter complained of currently before the court is not simply the complaint document signed by Ms Madunic (which the plaintiff acknowledges she received at the time), but the entire file produced under subpoena.
	


The proposed Further Amended Statement of Claim


	
	I first make a preliminary observation. For reasons which were never made clear, a proposed Further Amended Statement of Claim leaving Ms Dale as the second defendant (in relation to the assault) and pleading that the defamatory publication was made by the first defendant (South Eastern Sydney Local Health District) was tendered on this application (Exhibit F). However, I was asked instead to consider another Further Amended Statement of Claim setting out that the proposed new first defendant, Ms Madunic, published the matter complained of and relied upon joinder of South Eastern Sydney Local Health District as the second defendant (as well as Susan Dale as the third defendant) was also the defendant in the proceedings for assault. The matter complained of in both cases is the same document, namely the 69 pages of material produced under subpoena.
	
	
	These differences in the identity of the defendants in the two pleadings remain unexplained. However, as the argument before me went ahead on the basis that the plaintiff wishes to bring her defamation action against Ms Madunic alone, I have proceeded on the basis that the draft statement of claim referred to by the parties in argument (naming Ms Madunic as the sole defendant in the defamation proceedings) is the current proposed amended statement of claim.
	
	
	This finally brings me to the setting out of the current Further Amended Statement of Claim, the document embodying the plaintiff’s proposed amendments.
	
	
	First, this document changes the parties’ names and descriptions as follows:
	


“PART A - GENERAL

1. The plaintiff is a natural person entitled to sue.

2. The first defendant is a natural person and able to be sued.

3. The second defendant, the South Eastern Sydney Local Health District is a body corporate established under section 17 of the Health Services Act 1997 (NSW) and able to sue and be sued.

4. The third defendant is a natural person who was at all material times was an employee of the second defendant.”


	
	This means that Susan Dale is retained as a defendant for the assault claim but the other two named defendants are no longer the subject of proceedings.
	
	
	The only defendant against whom the defamation claim the subject of this application is brought is the first defendant named in the proposed Further Amended Statement of Claim, Ms Madunic. She is not sued for a “complaint” but for an email which attaches a number of copied documents all of which were produced under subpoena.
	
	
	I set out the defamation claim in full:
	


“PART B – DEFAMATION

5. On or about 17 September 2015, the first defendant published, or caused to be published, an email, which attached a number of copy documents specified in the email, to the Nursing & Midwifery Council of New South Wales ‘the matter complained of’ a copy of which is annexed to this pleading and marked ‘A’.

6. The matter complained of was defamatory of the plaintiff and in its natural and ordinary meaning conveyed the following imputations:

a. The plaintiff is so professionally incompetent that she is not fit to practice as a Registered Nurse. (Page4/ paragraphs 4-9, 6/8, 71-4, 48/1, 49/2, 63/2-16, 64/1-7, 65/6 and 67/5).

b. The plaintiff is so professionally incompetent as a Registered Nurse that she is a danger to patients (4/4-9, 6/8, 71-4, 48/11, 49/2, 63/2-16, 64/1-7, 65/6, 67/5 and 68/6-8).

c. The plaintiff as a Registered Nurse, consistently failed to correctly calculate correct drug doses for patients which put patients at serious risk of harm (8/7, 17/4-7, 18/3, 21/4-7, 22/8, 24/7, 63/16 and 652-3).

d. The plaintiff as a Registered Nurse, refused to listen to advice or constructive feedback from professional colleagues which put patients at serious risk of harm (8/8, 9/4-7, 10/6-7, 16/7-12, 19/6-10, 20/4, 31/6, 50/7, 57/5-6, 58/4-9, 59/4-12, 66/7 and 67/5).

e. The plaintiff as a Registered Nurse, consistently failed to adhere to basic nursing practice (8/7, 17/4-7, 18/3, 21/4-7, 22/8, 24/7, 25/8, 27/8, 29/3, 31/11, 37/4, 38/7, 39/4, 40/12, 42/8, 48/11, 49/2, 50/5-7, 52/5-6, 54/4-5, 59/4-12, 60/2, 62/5-10, 63/2-16, 64/1-7, 65/6, 66/7-8, 67/5-8 and 68/6-8).

7. By reason of the above, the plaintiff has suffered serious hurt and loss and damage.

Particulars of damage

a. The plaintiff has been injured in her credit and reputation;

b. The plaintiff has suffered hurt and embarrassment;

c. The plaintiff's employment prospects of a nurse or otherwise have been severely diminished;

d. The plaintiff will continue to suffer loss and damage.”


	
	As the imputations set out above (and the portions of the matter complained of asserted to give rise to them) demonstrate, the material relied upon goes beyond the letter of complaint signed by Ms Madunic to extend to all the documents provided by Ms Madunic to the Nursing & Midwifery Council on 17 September 2015.
	
	
	The 69 pages which are attached to the statement of claim consist of documents from the complaint file as produced on subpoena. A brief description of this document, and the plaintiff’s prior knowledge of it, is therefore necessary.
	
	
	The matter complained of commences with Ms Madunic’s email to the Nursing & Midwifery Council of 17 September 2015 in response to a request from the Nursing & Midwifery Council of 9 September 2015, addressed to Ms Madunic. This document is then followed by the results of the plaintiff’s assessment, a lengthy document which is signed (on page 69) by both the assessor and Ms Madunic, who authorises it. As Exhibit B demonstrates, the plaintiff must have known about Ms Madunic’s role as the person who lodged the complaint almost immediately, in that Exhibit B, which is addressed to the plaintiff personally, contains a bundle of documents under cover of Ms Madunic’s email dated 18 September 2015.
	
	
	The newly-added matter complained of does refer to complaints made by the first defendant, Ms Julie Herrick. On page 8 (at point 7) and page 66, Ms Julie Herrick is named as having complained that the plaintiff refused to listen to constructive advice or constructive feedback which put the patients at risk (imputation (d)). As the plaintiff’s line manager, Ms Herrick is clearly the complaining person in relation to most of the complaints made of and concerning the plaintiff by unnamed “staff members”, as well as being named in relation to the “bullying” claim the plaintiff made in 2013 which was referred to in the original statement of claim.
	
	
	I was not told the identity of the “Nursing Co-Director Gynaecology Services” who signed the report on its last page (page 69 of the matter complained of), or whether that is one of the defendants, but this person is clearly the author of the report which Ms Madunic authorised. The third defendant, Ms Dale, is also the person who allegedly assaulted the plaintiff 14 times, but is not named in the matter complained of.
	
	
	The plaintiff produced (Exhibit B) a series of documents (acknowledging the handwriting on them was hers) in the course of her oral evidence. These documents repeatedly identify Ms Madunic as the author of the 17 September 2017 complaint. Paragraph 8 of this document states:
	


“8. On 17 September 2015, the Council received further information from Vanessa Madunic, Acting Director of Operations, Royal Hospital for Women (RHW), providing clarification that the performance issues identified included medication safety, poor communication, inappropriate responses to an emergency situation and inappropriate oxygen administration (ex 3).”


	
	The plaintiff explained that she had overlooked receiving these documents, in circumstances she twice described as “a huge mistake”, because of her emotional stress.
	
	
	Paragraph 28 of this document states:
	


“Is Ms Naicker’s performance within accepted standards?

28. Ms Naiker’s ex-employer has expressed concerns on Ms Naicker’s performance which includes (ex 3):

- Poor communication re clinical handover

- Fabrication of patient observations

- Pool clinical decision making

- Unprofessional communication with staff

- Failure to receive constructive feedback

- Inability to calculate correct drug dosages

- Inappropriate oxygen administration”


	
	Each of these items had been ticked off by the plaintiff when she read this letter. She acknowledged this in her oral evidence. The similarity of this document to Mr Robison’s draft of the imputations in the 27 March 2017 pleading is immediately clear. This means that Mr Robison, as well as the plaintiff, must have seen this document when the 27 March 2017 statement of claim was being drafted. Whether they saw this document on subpoena or as a result of the plaintiff locating her own copy is irrelevant.
	
	
	What this means is that the plaintiff must be taken to have known (even if she subsequently forgot, due to her level of distress concerning these proceedings) that Ms Madunic, the proposed new defendant, had published the email sent to the Nursing & Midwifery Council on 17 September 2015, both when she received that letter at the time and when she saw the documents under subpoena in March 2017.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s explanation for overlooking this was set out in her affidavit in support of the application as well as in her oral evidence. This evidence is relevant to the issue of “misnomer” for the purposes of s 65(2)(b).
	


The plaintiff’s evidence


	
	The plaintiff provided an affidavit sworn on 4 September 2017 in support of her application for leave to amend and gave evidence which was not the subject of cross-examination.
	
	
	In her affidavit, the plaintiff sets out the circumstances in which she issued a subpoena at the beginning of 2017 to the Nursing & Midwifery Council of New South Wales for the complaint and describes how she gave copies of the documents she obtained under subpoena to her pro bono counsel, who was then successful in opposing the strike out application and in obtaining leave to amend. Mr Robison completed his pro bono task by drafting and filing the Amended Statement of Claim and the plaintiff obtained further leave for pro bono assistance which resulted in Mr Potter acting for her.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s position first was that she had no prior knowledge of any involvement by Ms Madunic. She states in paragraph 11:
	


“11. Prior to my attendance at the court registry to inspect the documents subpoenaed from NMC, I was not aware that Ms Madunic had published the email and accompanying documents to NMC. At that stage of inspection (March 2017), the limitation period had already expired (17 September 2016).”


	
	She goes on to say in paragraph 12:
	


“12. Also prior to that time I had not seen any of the documents contained in annexure A save for the letter addressed to me – I was never given copies of the Risk Assessment forms and therefore did not know their specific content.”


	
	However, she acknowledges in paragraph 13:
	


“13. Since making this application to amend, I have recently looked at all the records I had in my possession prior to commencement of proceedings. I came across a letter from the NMC dated 30 November 2015 which contained the Reasons for their decision to impose conditions upon my registration. A copy of this document is annexed and marked ‘C’. I now see that the document annexed to those reasons which states Appendix A exhibits [sic] states [sic] that Vanessa Madunic is the ‘current complainant’. Neither the complaint itself nor its attachments were provided before I saw them in the subpoenaed documents.”


	
	The plaintiff’s explanation is her distress and depression resulting from her workplace difficulties:
	


“14. At the time I received the letter at Annexure C (November 2015) I was very unwell as I could not get back to work. I suffered depression and reactive anxiety (panic attacks) as a result of my workplace issues. I have no recollection of reading this information and it is only now going back though [sic] my records, that I came across this reference. Had I been aware of it then I would have commenced proceedings against the correct complainant.”


	
	The plaintiff also sets out that prior to receiving pro bono advice from counsel at some unspecified time in 2017, she did not know that the limitation period for defamation was one year. She states that her intention has always been “to take proceedings against the person or persons who had made the complaint against me to the NMC” (paragraph 17).
	
	
	It is unclear whether Mr Robison provided advice to the plaintiff that the limitation period for defamation actions was one year, but I consider it more likely that not that, when the plaintiff’s claim was crystallised into a claim for defamation, she would have become aware that this was the case.
	
	
	I do not have a copy of the judgment dismissing the defendants’ application for summary disposal of this claim. I do not know whether the limitation period argument was raised or what explanation was given for the absence of the matter complained of, or whether the absence of this document meant that the plaintiff had not brought proceedings within time. It is at least arguable that the limitation period against any new party (such as Ms Madunic) had expired prior to leave to amend being granted on 27 March 2017, but this is not an issue for me to determine, any more than whether the current statement of claim falls outside the limitation period, as the plaintiff has abandoned her application for an extension of time to commence proceedings. I have, however, set out this long history of what documents and information the plaintiff had in her possession because these are matters relevant to the issue of misnomer.
	
	
	As the agreed issues before the Court confirm (see paragraph 6(a) – 5(e) above), the plaintiff only seeks leave to amend to replace the three named defendants by the name of the person who filed the complaint, Ms Madunic, on the basis of a misnomer for the purposes of s 65(2)(b) Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW), and not to continue to claim against the three named defendants. Her explanation is that because she always intended to sue the person who brought the complaint, as opposed to the persons who made the allegations against her at some earlier period in time, her joinder of the three currently named defendants was an error in the name of the author. However, the plaintiff never made her position clear about what she would do if leave to amend were refused. Would this be the end of the plaintiff’s defamation claim entirely, or would the plaintiff wish to continue the claim against, for example, Ms Herrick, who is named in the portions of the matter complained of in relation to at least one of the imputations? That is one of many uncertainties in this application.
	


The plaintiff’s submissions


	
	The plaintiff’s application is principally brought under s 65(2)(b). Section 65(2)(b) Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) provides:
	


“65 Amendment of originating process after expiry of limitation period

…

(2) At any time after the expiration of the relevant limitation period, the plaintiff in any such proceedings may, with the leave of the court under section 64 (1) (b), amend the originating process so as:

…

(b) to correct a mistake in the name of a party to the proceedings, whether or not the effect of the amendment is to substitute a new party, being a mistake that, in the court's opinion, is neither misleading nor such as to cause reasonable doubt as to the identity of the person intended to be made a party, or

…”


	
	Mr Potter submits, and I accept, that the power to grant leave to amend in the case of misnomer is one which should be given a broad interpretation where a plaintiff has made a genuine mistake as to the correct identity of the defendant. The landmark decision is Bridge Shipping Pty Ltd v Grand Shipping SA (1991) 173 CLR 231 where McHugh J at 260 states:
	


“The concluding words of subR(4) “whether or not the effect is to substitute another person as a party” enable a plaintiff to substitute one person for another person as a party to the action. Those words also imply that the fact that the plaintiff intended to sue the person who was sued does not prevent the sub-rule applying provided that there was a mistake in the name of the person sued. Moreover, a plaintiff may make “a mistake in the name of a party” not only because the plaintiff mistakenly believes that a certain person, whom the plaintiff can otherwise identify, bears a certain name but also because the plaintiff mistakenly believes that a person who answers a particular description bears a certain name. Thus, a plaintiff may make a mistake “in the name of a party” because, although intending to sue a particular person whom the plaintiff knows by sight, the plaintiff is mistaken as to that person's name. Equally, the plaintiff may make a mistake “in the name of a party” because, although intending to sue a person whom the plaintiff knows by a particular description, e.g. the driver of a certain car, the plaintiff is mistaken as to the name of the person who answers that description. In both cases, the plaintiff knows the person intended to be sued by reference to some property or properties which is or are peculiar to that person but is mistaken as to the name of that person. In the first case, the properties which identify the person are personal characteristics; in the second case, they are the properties which are of the essence of the description of that person. But for the purpose of subR(4) that distinction is irrelevant. In both cases, the plaintiff was mistaken only as to the name of the person intended to be sued. There is no warrant for treating subR(4) as dealing only with the case where the properties which identify the party are inherent properties. That is, there is no warrant for treating subR(4) as dealing only with the case where the plaintiff says: “The person I wish to substitute as a party is that entity which I identified by certain inherent properties peculiar to it but whose name I mistakenly believed was X”. The sub-rule applies equally to the case where the plaintiff says: “The person I wish to substitute as a party is that entity which I identified by reference to certain properties which are true of it and of no one else and whose name I mistakenly believed was X”. In both cases, a mistake in the name of the party has occurred and can be seen to have occurred only because the person sued does not have or is not identified by some property or properties which is or are peculiar to the person intended to be sued and to no one else.

O.36.01(4) is a remedial rule and should be given a beneficial interpretation. It is proper to give it the widest interpretation which its language will permit. It should be interpreted to cover not only cases of misnomer, clerical error and misdescription but also cases where the plaintiff, intending to sue a person he or she identifies by a particular description, was mistaken as to the name of the person who answers that description. In my opinion, Evans v Charrington and Lloyd Steel were correctly decided.” (Footnotes omitted)


	
	The application of s 65(2)(b) to such circumstances was more recently considered by Brereton J in In the matter of RCG CBD Pty Ltd [2016] NSWSC 1937 where his Honour stated at [13]:
	


“[13] At [21], His Honour observed that the rule was a remedial one to be given a wide interpretation, and that it should be interpreted to cover not only cases of misnomer, clerical error and misdescription, but also cases where the plaintiff, intending to sue a person he or she identifies by a particular description, was mistaken as to the name of the person who answers that description. Consequently, His Honour said that the rule had three limitations on a person's right to amend: first, that there must be a mistake; secondly, that it must be in the name of a party; and, thirdly, that the Court must be satisfied that no other party to the proceeding would be prejudiced in the conduct of his or her claim or defence in a way that could not fairly be met by an adjournment, costs or otherwise.”


	
	Mr Potter focuses his attention on the reference to the word “complaint” in the Amended Statement of Claim (at paragraph 4) and submits that there is no evidence of any other complaint besides that which was produced by the Nursing & Midwifery Council pursuant to the subpoena. In those circumstances, it is submitted, I should find that the clear intention of the plaintiff was to commence proceedings for defamation for publication of Ms Madunic’s complaint, as opposed to the complaints made to Ms Madunic and other persons in the hospital which resulted in Ms Madunic collating documents setting out a series of complaints about the plaintiff.
	
	
	This requires consideration not only of the statement of claim in its current form, but the claims brought against the three individual defendants as set out in the initial statement of claim. Who did the plaintiff intend to sue, and for what publication?
	
	
	Mr Potter submitted that part of the problem was that Mr Robison, who was very frank in his admissions to the plaintiff about not being expert in defamation, had missed this point, and that this may be the explanation for the inadequacies in the Amended Statement of Claim and the circumstances in which the three named defendants remained on the record as the publishers of the “complaint” as opposed to Ms Madunic, who collated the documents in question.
	
	
	I do not agree with this analysis. The three named defendants are nurses who are colleagues of the plaintiff and, as I understand her first Statement of Claim, she sees them as the source for her problems, in that they conspired to damage her career pathway by false allegations.
	
	
	What Ms Madunic did was to collate the documents prepared by others and to endorse the assessment carried out by the Nursing Co-Director (p. 69). She is not the initiator of the accusations against the plaintiff from her own observation; she essentially collated and endorsed the allegations and/or observations of others. As such, she may have the benefit of defences not available to the persons who actually made the allegations, who may have been motivated by malice: Drinkwater v Barwon Health Services & Butler (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Levine J, 27 June 1996).
	
	
	The three named defendants were never the publishers of the email initiating the complaint which is annexed to the proposed Amended Statement of Claim. As Mr Sibtain points out in his written submissions at paragraph 8, the plaintiff knew as early as 30 November 2015 that they had played no role in the preparation or publication of this formal document. The factual events referred to in the original statement of claim referred to their conduct and not to the subsequent complaint which was filed.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s “huge mistake” was identified by her as being a realisation she had when she personally served documents upon the three currently named defendants and saw Ms Madunic, who looked familiar. This may have been because of the complaints process or because of Ms Madunic’s role in approving the risk assessment carried out by the Nursing Co-Director for Gynaecology Services (see p. 69 of the proposed Further Amended Statement of Claim). Whatever the reason, she recognised Ms Madunic as a familiar face but nevertheless went ahead with the proceedings against the three named defendants.
	
	
	All of the evidence points to the plaintiff wishing to commence proceedings about the conduct of the three defendants in conspiring to damage her reputation and end her career by a campaign of harassment, complaint and assault (I note the allegations that Ms Dale assaulted her on 14 occasions between May 2013 and 1 July 2014). That makes it difficult for the plaintiff to assert, in seeking leave to replead her case to identify Ms Madunic’s written complaint of 17 September 2015 as the relevant publication, that she has made a mistake as to the identity of the author of the complaint, as opposed to seeking to bring fresh proceedings for a third party that would otherwise be out of time.
	
	
	Mr Potter’s s 65(2)(b) submission, on the basis of misnomer, is made upon the principles set out above, namely that the plaintiff always intended to sue the person who made the complaint who is “now known to be Ms Madunic” (paragraph 17, written submissions). There is no suggestion of any other complaints besides that which was produced by the Nursing & Midwifery Council of NSW pursuant to the subpoena.
	


Sections 64 and 65(1)(c) Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW)


	
	Alternatively, if the court determines that the claim is a new cause of action, the plaintiff relies upon s 65(1)(c) Civil Procedure Act so that, pursuant to sub-s (3), the amendment would have the effect from the date of commencement of the proceedings, namely within the limitation period (written submissions, paragraph 25). Mr Potter submits that it is unarguable that this new cause of action would arise from the same or substantially the same facts as those giving rise to the existing cause of action and relief (see New South Wales v Radford (2010) 79 NSWLR 327 at [72]).
	
	
	Finally, Mr Potter notes that proceedings were commenced on 15 August 2016 in relation to a publication made on 17 September 2015 and the proceedings were therefore commenced within twelve months of the date of publication (s 14B Limitation Act 1969 (NSW)), although the publication in question was neither attached nor referred to in the plaintiff’s initiating statement of claim. The reference in the Amended Statement of Claim filed on 27 March 2017 to “a complaint” made in 2015 to the Nursing & Midwifery Council should be sufficient to demonstrate that the plaintiff is not adding any new cause of action, but simply providing “flesh to the existing pleading by properly particularising the actual publication relied upon”. On this basis, it is submitted that leave to amend to include the matter complained of should be granted under s 64 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW).
	


Consideration of the plaintiff’s submissions


	
	For the reasons set out below, I am satisfied that the plaintiff is seeking to bring a new defamation claim against a non-party in circumstances where neither s 65(2)(b) nor s 65(2)(c) Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) can be engaged and where s 64 is inapplicable.
	
	
	Great caution should be used when applying the provisions of s 65 to multiple causes of action, such as claims for defamation, as opposed to a claim for a single cause of action, such as a personal injury or negligence claim. For example, in Greenwood v Papademetri [2007] NSWCA 221, the pleaded claim was against the owner and occupier where the owner was misdescribed and the amendment was allowed because of the ability of the court to determine who the “owner” was.
	
	
	However, where there may be a variety of potential defendants, the entitlement to amend become less clear. For example, in Sullivan v Van der Broek [1999] NSWSC 1177 where there were claims brought against five members of an unincorporated entity, no amendment was permitted to add further members. Windeyer J stated (at [9] – [11]):
	


“[9] There is no doubt that the plaintiff intended to sue persons who were members of the Nambucca Valley Galah Day Committee, namely persons who fell within that particular description. On the other hand, the action would not fail if all persons who were members of the committee were not joined as defendants. An organisation is not the defendant. It is easy enough to make a mistake in the name of an employer or a landlord but it is difficult to see how a mistake in number can amount to a mistake in name. In fact the evidence upon which the application for amendment was made did not establish with any certainty that the nine persons now sought to be substituted as defendants were members of the committee or the only members of the committee. The difficulty for the plaintiff in the application before the Master and for that matter on this appeal, is that it has not been shown that there was any mistake in joinder of the original defendants. The plaintiff is still claiming that those defendants were members of the relevant committee. In other words, each answered a particular description as a member of the committee, but now it is alleged that other people answered that description as well. McInerney J pointed out in Greentree v G.D. Searle & Co (unreported 31 July 1992) that there is no reason why more than one party cannot be substituted for the one party originally named. He went on to say, however, when dealing with the question of substitution of parties, rather than adding parties:-

“adding of parties normally includes the leaving of the original party in the action. In this case this is clearly a substitution of three parties for one party.”

[10] In Greentree the original defendant did not remain a party but three new defendants were named in substitution for the original defendant. The words quoted in the preceding paragraph accord with the decision of the Queensland Court of Appeal in Hayward v Darling Downs Aircraft Services Pty Ltd [1993] 2 Qd R 153, which held that the equivalent Queensland rule did not authorise addition of parties rather than substitution. A passage from the judgment of Toohey J in Bridge at p250 might give the impression that in Evans Constructions an order was made adding an additional defendant under the equivalent English rule. That did not happen. Such an order was made by the County Court Judge but this was corrected on appeal. In the present case there is no mistake in the names of the original five defendants and it is intended to leave them in, claiming that they were members of the committee. What the amendment seeks is to add four other persons whom it is also sought to say were members of the committee. In other words it is alleged in the amended claim, albeit not in appropriate words in accordance with the leave, that all nine defendants were members of the committee. It is not alleged that they were the only members of the committee or the members of the committee but ""members of the committee"". The defendants were separately named and separately numbered. I do not understand that a defendant A can be substituted for the same person A. In fact leaving the original defendants in makes it impossible to say there has been a mistake in name. The amendment does not fall within the categories of mistake to which McHugh J held the rule extended.

[11] This seems a hard case but limitation cases often are and Limitation Acts have a proper purpose.”


	
	Windeyer J’s observations were applied by Tobias JA in Greenwood v Papademetri at [72] – [75].
	
	
	Particular care must be exercised in defamation proceedings where an application, outside the limitation period, to join another party whom the plaintiff had not considered suing before cannot be rescued from the strict defamation limitation provisions by an application to add a defendant under s 65, for the reasons set out by Simpson J in Ahmed v Harbour Radio Pty Ltd [2010] NSWSC 676.
	
	
	All of the evidence points to the plaintiff bringing proceedings against three nurses with whom she had had difficulties during her employment and whom she believed to be responsible for allegations which led to her dismissal. I agree with the submission of the defendants that the fact that the plaintiff sued three persons and not one tends to indicate that she intended to sue each of them believing each had published defamatory comments about her, as opposed to the role Ms Madunic played as a person who made the formal complaint.
	
	
	There is no evidence that the plaintiff took any step to confirm or identify the true publisher of the actual complaint letter of 17 September 2015 prior to commencement of proceedings by her against Julie Herrick, Susan Dale and Virginia King. They appear to be the persons who are the subject of her complaint by reason of their actions against her, not by reason of the contents of the complaint document which was prepared by Ms Madunic. In those circumstances, there cannot be a mistake of the kind contemplated by s 65(2)(b).
	
	
	In addition, I am satisfied that the mistake fails to comply with the requirement in s 65(2)(b) that the mistake should not be misleading nor such as to cause reasonable doubt as to the identity of the person to be made a party. Unlike factual situations of the kind seen in Campbell v Boston (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Levine J, 17 February 1995 at p. 6), this is not a case where the existing or proposed defendants would have known that the plaintiff always intended to bring proceedings against Ms Madunic. To the contrary, the defendants would have understood the plaintiff’s complaints about Ms Dale to have something to do with Ms Dale’s own conduct, possibly referable in some way to the circumstances of the 14 assaults she is alleged to have committed.
	
	
	Mr Sibtain submits, in my view correctly, that the fact that the plaintiff wants to replace three names with one is itself an indication of the change in her case from an action against her false accusers to her claim based on the bringing of the complaint by Ms Madunic. The plaintiff never delineated the basis upon which her claim was brought against each of the current defendants beyond pleading that each of them was an employed nurse and that one of them had assaulted her 14 times.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the naming of the three defendants was not a misnomer and that, if it were, it was a mistake which is misleading and such as to cause reasonable doubt as to the identity of the person intended to be joined as a party. As noted below, I am further satisfied that, even if this were not the case, the leave of the court should not be granted for discretionary reasons. The joinder of the defendant, Ms Madunic, should not be permitted pursuant to s 65(2)(b).
	


Section 65(2)(c) Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW)


	
	I am also satisfied that the new claim does not arise from the same or substantially the same facts as the plaintiff’s original and first amended claim in defamation as required to satisfy s 65(2)(c).
	
	
	The description of the three named defendants’ conduct in the original Statement of Claim, even as formulated in the Amended Statement of Claim prepared by Mr Robison, appears to relate to different publications which resulted in the preparation of the complaint, as opposed to the actual letter of complaint. The nature of the cause of action for defamation is such that there must be real difficulties in satisfying s 65(2)(c) as being a cause of action which arises from “the same (or substantially the same) facts as those giving rise to an existing cause of action and claim for relief set out in the originating process” in that different issues of liability arise depending on the nature and extent of publication, its content and the circumstances in which it is made.
	
	
	I also note that s 65(2)(c) is directed to the addition of a cause of action against an existing defendant, as opposed to a new defendant, as Simpson J notes in Ahmed v Harbour Radio Pty Ltd at [67].
	


Section 64 Civil Procedure Act


	
	The plaintiff is seeking to join an additional defendant to raise a new claim in circumstances falling outside ss 65(2)(b) and 65(2)(c) Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW).
	
	
	I am satisfied that if the application were made under s 64 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW), it would be time-barred, and accordingly could not be permitted, having regard to the limitation period applicable for defamation actions.
	


The leave of the court


	
	In the event that I have erred in my findings as to the applicability of ss 64 and 65 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW), I also note that any amendment to a pleading requires leave of the court. The exercise of discretion to grant or refuse leave must follow the dictates of justice: ss 56-58 and 64(2) Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW). That means considering the nature and degree of any prejudice (which is not an issue here) and a range of other circumstances including the efficient conduct of proceedings pursuant to ss 56-62 (especially s 58(2) Civil Procedure Act.
	
	
	If the application by the plaintiff did fall within the rubric of s 65(2)(b) and/or s 65(2)(c), would the dictates of justice be served by the addition of Ms Madunic in the place of the defendants? Mr Potter submitted it is just a change of name. Mr Sibtain submitted that the amendment should not be made because any claim against Ms Madunic was hopeless (see Drinkwater v Barwon Health Services & Butler) and that the plaintiff’s concessions in the witness box meant there was no reasonable explanation for this late amendment, but there is no claim of prejudice beyond presumptive prejudice of the kind commonly made in relation to late amendment.
	
	
	There is very little authority on this issue. In Greenwood v Papadimitriou  Tobias JA (at [49] – [50]) noted this point had not been taken, although his Honour seems to have considered it should have been:
	


“[49] I note that the Civil Procedure Act was enacted later than the Civil Liability (Personal Responsibility) Act. Thus, when s 65(5) says “this section has effect despite anything to the contrary in the Limitation Act 1969” it is talking about a Limitation Act that has already been recast by the Civil Liability (Personal Responsibility) Act. Thus, s 65(2)(b) can permit what is in substance an extension of a limitation period, even though that limitation period is incapable of extension under the Limitation Act itself.

[50] The fact that ss 64 and 65 Civil Procedure Act between them provide the only means by which a limitation period for a cause of action founded on negligence, nuisance, or breach of duty for damages for personal injury can be extended, if the three-year post discoverability limitation period has expired, focuses attention upon the need for close examination of the appropriateness, in the circumstances of the particular case, of exercising the discretion that is provided by ss 64 and 65. However, as I have said earlier, no argument was based on discretion in the court below, or on the appeal. Any such discretionary argument could well take into account the facts that resulted in the limitation period having expired — ie, the facts by reference to which the cause of action was discoverable on a particular date. The issue of when this cause of action was discoverable was not litigated in the court below. Nor were arguments concerning culpability for the delay in starting the action, or prejudice. Thus, the approach that the parties have taken to this appeal means that it is being decided purely on the basis of the existence of the power under s 65(2)(b). I cannot help thinking that that is an artificially narrow basis, but it is a basis that the parties themselves have adopted.”


	
	The list of factors given by Tobias JA, when applied to the facts of this case, would support the refusal of leave. The cause of action was discoverable and the culpability for delay lies entirely on the plaintiff. There are special concerns in defamation proceedings, having regard to the very strict limitation provisions. Accordingly, I am of the view that, if I have erred in holding that leave to make the amendment of the parties’ names should not have been granted, I would not have exercised my discretion to allow the amendment.
	


The other amendments to the statement of claim


	
	The plaintiff has been granted leave to make the three amendments which are not in dispute.
	
	
	The sole remaining question relates to the challenge to the attachment of Annexure “A” to the pleading; in the previous two pleadings, the matter complained of was not attached (in fact, it is arguable that it was not even identified, although this point was not taken).
	
	
	I was not addressed as to what should happen to the matter complained of if I refused leave to amend to join Ms Madunic. The defendants challenged the amendment of the pleading to add Annexure “A”, but solely on the basis that it was a document obtained under subpoena (written submissions, paragraph 19), citing Riddick v Thames Board Mills Ltd [1977] QB 881 and Sapphire (SA) Pty Ltd t/as River City Grain v Barry Smith Grains Pty Ltd (in liq) [2011] NSWSC 1451 at [173]-[200], as the plaintiff does not seek to use this document to advance the claim against the same defendant but against a new defendant (Barach v University of New South Wales [2011] NSWSC 1327 at [54]-[56]).
	
	
	The plaintiff relied upon the exception to this rule set out in Miller v RL Polk & Co (Australia) Pty Ltd (New South Wales Supreme Court, Hunt J, 4 July 1985), namely for confirmation of information already known to the plaintiff, which was the basis upon which Hunt J distinguished Riddick v Thames Board Mills Ltd.
	
	
	However, that flies in the face of the plaintiff’s claim that she had forgotten about the existence of these documents as a result of her distressed state. If the purpose of issuing the subpoena was to booster the case against the three named defendants, in circumstances where the plaintiff had forgotten about what she knew about Ms Madunic, the defendants’ argument concerning the unavailability of information obtained under subpoena, an argument the significance of which emerged only after the plaintiff gave her evidence.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s answer is that this document is “the 2015 complaint” referred to in the amended pleading of Mr Robison is this complaint and that, as that amendment was made within time, the plaintiff should be entitled to amend to attach the document to which the plaintiff was referring. The plaintiff’s “huge mistake” in naming the wrong defendant should not prevent her from attaching the documents that should have been attached to the previous pleading. The defendants appear to accept that the document obtained under subpoena is the complaint the plaintiff was always planning to sue on, and in those circumstances the claim is not an abuse of the process of the court.
	
	
	However, the plaintiff’s other problem is that she wishes to sue Ms Madunic for this publication, not the three currently named defendants, as I understand her claim. If the plaintiff’s case is “Ms Madunic or nobody”, as I understand to be the case, then not only should I refuse her leave to amend her claim to replace the three named defendants but also leave to plead the matter complained of as well.
	
	
	Unfortunately, the way the argument proceeded was that I was to determine the issue of whether leave should be granted to amend the names on the basis of misnomer, and not for the dismissal of the whole defamation claim on the basis that the plaintiff no longer wished to bring proceedings against the three named defendants at all. Striking out the matter complained of would amount to striking out the whole of the claim, which was an issue that was not argued before me.
	
	
	Another problem is that the plaintiff does not in fact accept that the documents which form Annexure A in fact constitute all of the documents which should be produced in answer to the subpoena. She filed a Notice of Motion on 3 October 2017 seeking orders “in respect to a breach of subpoenaed material”, adding that “the plaintiff provides a supporting affidavit depicting the core material/s which did not present [sic] in the subpoena”. The affidavit of the plaintiff sets out documents which the plaintiff appears to say should have been contained in Annexure A as part of the matter complained of. It looks as though Annexure A is a work in progress.
	
	
	By reason of the very late service on the party the subject of the subpoena, the South Eastern Local Health District, I was unable to deal with this Notice of Motion, but I am concerned that the identity of the matter complained of may still be the subject of challenge. This was a matter which, by reason of the lateness of the plaintiff’s notice of motion, neither party has addressed. If the purpose of the notice of motion is to make further changes to the matter complained of and/or the parties or imputations, that will need to be addressed when (or if) the notice of motion is heard.
	
	
	The complexities of the pleadings and changes of position by the plaintiff, rather than the oversight of counsel, are the reason for this situation. I have only been asked to determine the application for leave to amend the statement of claim and, in relation to the matter complained of, the fact that it was obtained on subpoena (which I have rejected) and was the subject of a complete defence of immunity from suit (an argument later abandoned).
	
	
	It may be that the plaintiff wishes to continue her claim against one or more of the defendants based on the contents of Exhibit A. In the circumstances I shall err on the side of caution and leave the issue of the status of the matter complained of until I receive the further submissions of the parties and/or hear the plaintiff’s application in her Notice of Motion dated 3 October 2017.
	


Conclusions


	
	I have noted above that the plaintiff did not elaborate on what was to occur to the defamation claim if leave to commence proceedings against Ms Maduncic instead of the three currently named defendants were refused. If the plaintiff wishes to continue her defamation claim against one or more of the existing defendants, that claim will be the subject of case management, including any application by the defendants to strike out the proceedings in relation to one or all of the defendants and/or to strike out the matter complained of, as well as any application by the plaintiff to strike in additional parts of the publication and/or to proceed with her Notice of Motion.
	
	
	However, the matter may only remain in the Defamation List while there is a claim on foot for defamation and the parties are advised that, if the defamation claim against the existing defendants is not to continue, these proceedings will be returned to the General List.
	
	
	I was not addressed on costs. It is my view that costs should follow the event (r 42.1 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW)). Even if the plaintiff had been successful, her application to amend is the seeking of an indulgence, and parties who amend generally pay the costs occasioned thereby unless the application has been unreasonably opposed (which is not the case here). I have made an order for the plaintiff to pay the defendants’ costs, but with liberty to apply.
	


Order


	
	Plaintiff’s application to change her surname on both JusticeLink and the statement of claim to “Clarke”, to change particulars (k) and (l) in relation to the assault claim and to add paragraph 11 to the statement of claim is granted.
	
	
	Plaintiff’s application to amend the Amended Statement of Claim to replace the current three named defendants with the name “Vanessa Madunic” is dismissed.
	
	
	Plaintiff pay defendants' costs.
	
	
	Liberty to apply in relation to costs.
	
	
	The parties are to bring in Short Minutes of Order reflecting a timetable for the continued progress of these proceedings, including:
	



	
	The change to the plaintiff’s surname,
	
	
	The amended pleadings for the assault agreed to by the defendant;
	
	
	The plaintiff’s Notice of Motion filed on 3 October 2017 and any challenge to the proposed continuation of the claim as against the three currently named defendants (including any challenges in relation to the matter complained of); and
	
	
	If the defamation claim is abandoned, orders for the transfer of these proceedings to the General List for directions concerning the assault claim, including a return date for whichever list the proceedings remain in.

		23 November 2017",2017-11-01 00:00:00,NSW District Court
6320372,Artery v R [2017] NSWCCA 259,"Judgment


	
	PAYNE JA: I have had the advantage of reading the reasons of Adamson J in draft. I agree with her Honour’s reasons. I wish only to make a few additional observations.
	
	
	Although the sole ground of appeal was that the verdict on count 1 was unreasonable having regard to the jury’s verdict on count 2, the applicant’s written submissions appeared to address a complaint that was that it was not open on the whole of the evidence for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the credibility and reliability of the complainant’s evidence about count 1 in circumstances where there was an absence of complaint evidence given by the complainant’s mother and thus the evidence concerning count 1 was uncorroborated, the complaint was only made to the police nearly 30 years after the events and there was potential for conscious or unconscious contamination of the complainant’s memory and her evidence.
	
	
	At the commencement of oral address, however, Mr Flynn, who appeared for the applicant, made clear that the complaint about an unreasonable verdict was limited to a complaint that the jury had returned inconsistent verdicts on counts 1 and 2.
	
	
	For the reasons given by Adamson J, I agree that the jury did not return inconsistent verdicts. I agree with the orders proposed by Adamson J.
	
	
	JOHNSON J: I agree with Adamson J.
	
	
	ADAMSON J: The applicant seeks leave pursuant to s 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) to appeal against his conviction on indictment of one count of indecent assault of a person under the age of 16 years. The sole ground of appeal is that the verdict on count 1 is unreasonable having regard to the jury’s verdict on count 2.
	
	
	The indictment was presented in the following terms:
	


“Count 1: Between 31 July 1985 and 1 September 1985, at Richmond in the State of New South Wales, did assault [the complainant], a person under the age of 16 years, namely, 11 years, and at the time of the assault committed an act of indecency upon her (s.61E(1) Crimes Act 1900).

Count 2: Between 31 August 1985 and 1 October 1985, at Richmond in the State of New South Wales, did have sexual intercourse with [the complainant], a person under the age of 16 years, namely, 11 years, without her consent and knowing she was not consenting (s.61D(1) Crimes Act 1900).”


	
	The applicant was sentenced on 17 February 2017 by way of a bond imposed pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). No application for leave to appeal against sentence has been filed.
	
	
	Where there is a complaint that a jury verdict is unreasonable because of inconsistency between other verdicts returned, the question is whether there is an acceptable explanation for the differentiation as a matter of logic and reasonableness: see the summary of authorities in Nguyen v R [2017] NSWCCA 145 at [34]-[47] and [52]-[53] .
	
	
	It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that there was a necessary inconsistency between the verdicts such as to give rise to the conclusion that the verdict of guilty on count 1 is unreasonable. In order to address this submission it is necessary to examine the evidence to determine whether there is a rational explanation for the difference in the verdicts returned for counts 1 and 2.
	


The evidence at trial


	
	The complainant was born in 1974. When she was 5 or 6 her parents moved to a place just outside Lithgow. Her father met the applicant at a hotel and invited him home for dinner from time to time. The complainant’s family later moved to the Mudgee area. In late 1983 the complainant’s parents separated. The complainant, her mother and sister moved to Richmond where her mother conducted a nail salon business close to the home. She worked long hours and worked late on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. At these times the complainant was home with her sister alone.
	
	
	The complainant’s mother began an intimate relationship with the applicant. He stayed overnight from time to time.
	


Count 1

The evidence of count 1


	
	The first incident was in August 1985, when the complainant was 11 years old. Prior to that day, the applicant had played a game with the complainant a few times. He grabbed her from behind and rubbed his hands down over her breast and stomach area. The complainant was not developed at the time. On the day of the incident, the applicant was getting ready to leave the house. He went in and out through the front door. The complainant was in the lounge room, standing between two lounges. The applicant grabbed the complainant roughly, rubbed her and then let go. It seemed more deliberate and rough. The applicant returned and did it again. He grabbed and pinched the complainant's nipples (count 1) and looked at her very intently. The complainant, who was worried and alarmed, went out the front door and down the path towards the driveway as she did not want to be in the house with the applicant. The complainant stood on the pathway between the front door and the driveway. The applicant's car was parked in the driveway. The applicant walked past and grabbed her again and pinched her nipples. He got into his car and looked back at the complainant.
	
	
	The complainant could not recall the first time that the applicant played the game. She initially described it as a game because the applicant was laughing and smiling. The incident on this day scared her more because it was prolonged and seemed more deliberate. The other times, he had brushed over her breasts and she was not sure whether it was an accident. This incident was the final time that it occurred. She could not recall what she was wearing.
	


The evidence of complaint with respect to count 1


	
	Some time after the incident but before count 1, the complainant and her mother were driving past the RAAF base at Richmond, heading into Windsor. The complainant was in the front seat and did not recall whether anyone else was in the car. She told her mother that she was getting scared because the applicant was grabbing her and pinching her nipples. The complainant's mother did not ask her daughter “very many” questions and did not seem to want to start a conversation about it. The complainant did not think anyone else was in the car at the time.
	


Count 2

The evidence of count 2


	
	The next incident was on a Monday in the September 1985 school holidays. The complainant was 11 years old. Her mother was at work. Her sister was away in Townsville for longer than a night visiting a school friend. The complainant was sitting on the floor in the lounge room in front of the television. She was still wearing her pyjamas: a matching set of shorts and a top, which were white with a blue pattern on them. The complainant was wearing underpants but she was not wearing a bra. She had not yet started to wear one. The applicant, who was the only other person in the house, was sitting at his usual seat at the head of the dining room table, reading the paper. He was wearing long blue work pants and a blue work shirt. He asked the complainant to come over and sit with him. She went over and the applicant picked her up and put her on his lap with her back against his chest. This was the first time she had ever sat on his lap.
	
	
	The applicant put one hand around her waist and the other into her underpants. He rubbed the entrance to her vagina and her clitoris. The applicant continued to rub her vagina for more than a few minutes. The complainant looked at the newspaper and talked to the applicant about an advertisement for a car. She explained it was a coping mechanism, to try to disassociate from what was happening. The applicant pushed the end of his finger into her vagina. It was either the index finger or the next finger. He asked her, “does that feel nice?” and, “does that tickle?” The complainant responded yes to the second question. The complainant did not want the applicant to touch her genital area and did not want him to put his finger inside her vagina. She was very scared. She was not sure how long he had his finger inside her. The applicant's fingers felt rough and course. The other fingers on his same hand rubbed the outside of her vagina.
	
	
	The applicant removed his finger and told the complainant that he was going to bed. He asked if she wanted to go with him, and she said no. The applicant removed his arms from around her. The complainant got off his lap and stood beside the table. She was worried something would happen if it looked as if she was going to try to leave. The applicant asked, “are you sure you don't want to come?” and the complainant again declined. The applicant walked out of the dining room, through the kitchen and out of the complainant's sight. She heard a door shut and assumed it was the bathroom or the toilet. She grabbed her Cocker Spaniel, Connie, and went through the lounge room to her bedroom. The complainant shut her door. There was no lock. She put jeans on and waited to see what would happen. She heard the applicant walk up the hallway and into the bedroom that he shared with the complainant's mother. When she heard the door shut, she left her bedroom with Connie and left the house through the back door by the laundry. The complainant went out the side gate, up the driveway and ran to her mother's nail salon which was about 2kms away.
	


The evidence of complaint with respect to count 2

The complainant’s evidence about her complaints with respect to count 2


	
	When the complainant arrived at the salon, her mother was at a work table with a client who was sitting opposite. The complainant and her mother went to the kitchenette at the back of the shop. The complainant told her mother that the applicant had put his hands in her underpants and rubbed her, and asked her to go to bed with him. The complainant could not recall her mother's response. She did not ask the complainant for details or offer her comfort. The complainant's mother asked the complainant to wait in the salon. There were clients there. The complainant waited, with Connie, until the end of the day when her mother finished work. When they left the salon, they went straight home. The complainant did not remember seeing the applicant again that afternoon. It is possible that he was asleep.
	
	
	The complainant did not have any further conversations with her mother about the matter either that day or in the days immediately afterwards. The applicant seemed to disappear for a week or two and then he started coming back to the house again. The complainant could not recall telling anyone else about the incident immediately afterwards. She could not recall telling her sister about the incident when she returned from Townsville.
	
	
	In 1985 and 1986, the complainant attended the local primary school. Her closest friends included Vanessa and Jennifer. The complainant told Vanessa about what the applicant had done. She could not recall when she told her. When she was in high school, the complainant also told Jennifer details about what had happened.
	


The evidence of those to whom the complainant had complained about count 2


	
	The complainant's sister gave evidence of going to Townsville to visit a school friend in 1985. On her return she noticed tension between her mother and the complainant. She gave evidence of the complainant telling her that she had been lying on her bed when the applicant entered the room, lay on the bed beside her and put his hand up her dress. The complainant’s sister agreed in cross-examination that the allegation was an ongoing issue with the family and was raised from time to time. The first time it was seriously raised in a family context was over 21 years prior to the trial.
	
	
	Jennifer, the complainant’s school friend, gave evidence that in about 1985 the complainant said, “My mother's boyfriend has been putting his hands down my pants while watching TV”. Jennifer gave evidence that the complainant had reported that she had told her mother, who had not believed her.
	
	
	Vanessa, another school friend of the applicant’s, gave evidence through the officer-in-charge, Detective Senior Constable Rebecca Clark that in about 1985 or 1986 the complainant told her that the applicant “put his hands into my underwear and touched me.”
	


The pretext call made by the complainant to the applicant on 19 November 2012


	
	On 19 November 2012 the complainant telephoned the applicant. The call was recorded by a listening device obtained pursuant to a warrant. In respect of the conduct in count 2, the complainant said:
	


“It was the school holidays in 1985 and I was eleven. You got me to sit on your lap and you put your fingers inside my pants. Does that ring any bells to you?”


	
	The complainant agreed in cross-examination that she had not made any suggestion to the applicant during this call that he had put his finger or fingers inside her vagina.
	
	
	The applicant gave evidence at the trial in which he denied committing the alleged offences.
	


The summing up


	
	Of present relevance, in relation to count 2, the trial judge noted in the summing up that the complainant said nothing about the applicant putting his finger into her vagina during the pretext call, or to any of the complaint witnesses. His Honour expressly distinguished the evidence of complaint about count 2 from the evidence of complaint about count 1 in the following passage:
	


“Members of the jury, you need to understand this. Count 2 is a particular allegation. It is a particular allegation of a particular kind of sexual assault. It is a particular charge that deals with sexual intercourse. It is constituted by the insertion of the accused's finger into the child's vagina.

That is the allegation. If, at the end of this particular case, you think, as far as count 2 is concerned, that there may have been some lesser kind of sexual touching but not the one that is alleged by the Crown in respect of count 2, then your obligation, consistent with your oath, is to acquit the accused because the Crown will not have proved what it is that the Crown has set out to prove.

You will also recall, members of the jury, that, in respect of count 1, at p 39 of the transcript lines 30 to 41, the complainant gave evidence of having made a complaint to her mother about having had her breasts touched and nipples pinched, and she was able to, in respect to my particular question, not only confirm that she had made a complaint but tie it down to a point in time before the accused put his finger into her vagina. This was the series of questions and answers from line 32, the question by me:

‘Q. . . . yesterday when you were giving evidence about the accused having touched you on the breasts and pinched your nipples both in the lounge room and then out in the driveway, you told the Crown Prosecutor that you later told your mother what had happened in a car from Richmond?

A. Yes.

Q. My question is, did you tell your mother about that before or after this occasion that you have just described where the accused put his finger into your vagina?

A. I told her beforehand.’

So there you have some evidence from the complainant that, consistent with her allegation and at a time proximate to it, she made a complaint to her mother. Her mother gave no evidence of that and, in fact, her mother was not asked about that, but that is the complainant's recollection.”


	
	The trial judge emphasised in the summing up the importance of the jury being satisfied that there was penetration for proof of count 2. His Honour said:
	


“Again, in a very practical way, it simply comes down to an assessment as to whether or not you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt when the complainant says, ‘He put his finger into my vagina when I was sitting on his lap.’ If you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt, then you convict. If you have a reasonable doubt, then you acquit. It really is that simple.”

The period after the jury had retired


	
	The jury retired to consider its verdict on the afternoon of 8 February 2017. After lunch on 9 February 2017, his Honour indicated he had received a jury note which said: “We are very close to a verdict on count 1. It is highly unlikely we will come to a verdict on count 2 today.”
	
	
	On the morning of 10 February 2017 the trial judge announced that another jury note had been received. His Honour read out the following:
	


“Your Honour, Count number 1 the jury has come to a unanimous decision”.


	
	The transcript recorded that the trial judge said the following in the absence of the jury:
	


“HIS HONOUR: In respect of count 2, I'm not going to read the note out to you verbatim. What they request is some more guidance in respect of count 2. Count 2, Mr Crown, is a charge of sexual intercourse without consent constituted by, in this case, the insertion of either the index finger or middle finger into the vagina of the child. The reason why I'm not going to read out the note to you, or part 2 of the note to you, verbatim is because the preamble to that request discloses some of the jury's thinking behind the request, and that is why I cannot share it with the parties.

But, as I have said, it is a request for some more guidance on count 2, so I am going to explain to them what is required in this particular case, given the way the Crown has run its case, and I am going to explain to them that if they have a doubt about that act, then they must acquit.”


	
	After consulting counsel about the proposed course, the trial judge invited the jury to return to the court room. The jury returned a verdict of guilty in relation to count 1 at 11.17am on Friday 10 February 2017. The trial judge then gave further detailed directions in relation to count 2 as follows:
	


“In respect of count 2, you have requested some more guidance in relation to that matter. Count 2 is a charge that the accused committed an act of sexual intercourse on the complainant. Sexual intercourse can be constituted by a number of different things. In this particular case, it is constituted by if, in fact, it occurred, is the digital penetration of the complainant's vagina by the accused who, in this case, according to the complainant inserted either his index or middle finger part way into her vagina. That is the particular of the charge, count 2, and it is that matter about which you must be satisfied about beyond a reasonable doubt.

As I have said to you during the course of my directions, any sexual touching that you may think may have occurred on the occasion alleged by the complainant that falls short of the actual penetration of her vagina by his finger, whichever one it was, would be insufficient at law for you bring back a verdict of guilty.”


	
	Following this further direction, the jury sent another note, the contents of which were not disclosed to the parties. By further notes the jury sought transcript and informed the trial judge that the jury was deadlocked, as a consequence of which his Honour gave a Black direction. At 3.58pm on 10 February 2017, the jury returned a unanimous verdict of not guilty in relation to count 2.
	


Whether the verdicts are inconsistent


	
	The applicant argued that the verdicts were inconsistent because the jury, by its verdicts, had apparently accepted the complainant’s evidence on count 1 and not on count 2.
	
	
	That a jury reaches a different verdict with respect to different counts does not lead to any assumption of inconsistency. Where an accused is acquitted of a charge of sexual offence, it ought not be assumed that the jury did not find the complainant credible, particularly where a guilty verdict has been returned on another count. In MFA v The Queen (2002) 213 CLR 606; [2002] HCA 53, Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ said at [34]:
	


“In the case of sexual offences, of which there may be no objective evidence, some, or all, of the members of a jury may require some supporting evidence before they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the word of a complainant. This may not be unreasonable. It does not necessarily involve a rejection of the complainant's evidence. A juror might consider it more probable than not that a complainant is telling the truth but require something additional before reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt. The criminal trial procedure is designed to reinforce, in jurors, a sense of the seriousness of their task, and of the heavy burden of proof undertaken by the prosecution. A verdict of not guilty does not necessarily imply that a complainant has been disbelieved, or a want of confidence in the complainant. It may simply reflect a cautious approach to the discharge of a heavy responsibility. In addition to want of supporting evidence, other factors that might cause a jury to draw back from reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt in relation to some aspects of a complainant's evidence might be that the complainant has shown some uncertainty as to matters of detail, or has been shown to have a faulty recollection of some matters, or has been shown otherwise to be more reliable about some parts of his or her evidence than about others.” 


	
	The present case appears to me to be an example of the appropriately cautious approach of the jury to the decision whether the Crown had proved its case, particularly with respect to count 2, beyond reasonable doubt. What occurred after the jury retired indicates that the jury had little difficulty in coming to a unanimous verdict in relation to count 1. The evidence of the offence and the evidence of complaint corresponded with count 1.
	
	
	However, the jury had difficulty in coming to a unanimous verdict in relation to count 2 and asked questions which can be taken to have reflected its concern about whether the Crown had proved count 2 beyond reasonable doubt. The jury had been told in the summing up that the complainant’s complaint about count 2 had been made to a number of people. However the complaint did not include a complaint about penetration; the evidence was that the complainant complained that the applicant had put his hand inside her underpants. This was all that the complainant put to the applicant in the pretext call on 19 November 2012. It was open to the jury to reason that, while it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about count 1, it retained a reasonable doubt about count 2 because the complainant had not told her mother or her friends that the applicant had digitally penetrated her vagina and had not accused the applicant of digital penetration in the pretext call.
	
	
	There was, accordingly, a basis on which the jury could differentiate between its verdict on count 1 and its verdict on count 2. In these circumstances, the applicant has not established that the verdicts were inconsistent.
	
	
	I would propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.

6320383,SafeWork NSW v Harris Holdings NSW Pty Ltd; SafeWork NSW v Harry Zizikas [2017] NSWDC 299,"Judgment


	
	Harris Holdings NSW Pty Limited (Harris Holdings) has pleaded guilty to an offence that as a person who had a health and safety duty pursuant to s 19 of the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (the Act) it failed to comply with that duty and thereby exposed Mohammad Ibrahim Pakeer Mohammad (Mr Mohammad) to a risk of death or serious injury contrary to s 32 of the Act.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the offence is a fine of $1,500,000.
	
	
	Mr Harry Zizikas (Mr Zizikas) has pleaded guilty to an offence that as a person who had a health and safety duty under s 27 of the Act, to exercise due diligence to ensure that Harris Holdings complied with its duty under s 19(1) of the Act, he failed to comply with that duty and the failure to comply with that duty exposed Mr Mohammad to a risk of death or serious injury contrary to s 32 of the Act.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the offence is a fine of $300,000.
	


BACKGROUND


	
	In both matters an Agreed Statement of Facts was tendered. An Agreed Sentence Tender Bundle was tendered. The findings of fact now set out are based upon that material.
	
	
	At all material times Harris Holdings was a registered corporation with its registered address at 26 Queen Street, Croydon, New South Wales.
	
	
	At all material times Harris Holdings conducted a business or undertaking in the processing of domestic and commercial waste. The business services the greater Sydney area in waste disposal and recycling of domestic, industrial and commercial waste products, in particular demolition and building site waste.
	
	
	At the time of the incident Harris Holdings employed 26 workers, and four of those worked at 160 Arthur Street, Lidcombe (Homebush West) in the State of New South Wales (the site).
	
	
	At the time of the incident Mr Zizikas was the sole director of Harris Holdings.
	
	
	At the time of the incident Mr Zizikas was involved in overseeing the management and business operations of the company.
	
	
	Mr Zizikas was responsible for all of Harris Holdings’ training and the development of systems associated with the site operations.
	
	
	Mr Mohammad Ibrahim Pakeer Mohammad commenced full time employment as a labourer with Harris Holdings on 1 October 2014, doing sorting work.
	
	
	Mr Mohammad worked 5.5 to 6 days a week processing commercial and domestic waste at the site.
	
	
	At all material times Mr Perinparasha Nadarasa, leading hand and operator, was supervisor for the site. Mr Nadarasa’s role included organising the workers on a daily basis, choosing which material to sort and how that material was to be sorted. Mr Nadarasa reported to Mr Zizikas.
	
	
	The four workers who usually undertook work at the site at the relevant time were Mr Mohammad, Mr Nadarasa, Mr Rajenthiram Namsivayam and Mr Raymond Francis Xaviour Salvaraja. Mr Namsivayam and Mr Salvaraja undertook similar duties to Mr Mohammad. The four workers are all Sri Lankans, who spoke fluent Tamil. The workers had a very poor understanding of spoken English and could not read or write English other than the odd word. Three of the workers including Mr Mohammad resided together in a share house.
	
	
	At all material times Harris Holdings was the owner of Komatsu Excavator Serial Number 30098 (the excavator). The excavator was purchased in 2012; it was manufactured in approximately 2004.
	
	
	The excavator was used on a daily basis at the site to sort through items which were too heavy for the workers to pick up. The excavator moved around the sorting yard while the sorters worked in the perimeter of the yard using their hands to sort through items. The excavator regularly slewed on its tracks and its main structure during operation when moving rubbish.
	
	
	The sorting yard of the site is split into various sections - one section for steel and concrete, another with top soil, another for garbage. Trucks arrived on site and dropped off material to one section of the yard. Workers and the excavator then sorted the materials into the piles in the section relevant to the specific material.
	


THE INCIDENT


	
	On 26 November 2015 Mr Nadarasa was operating the excavator, with a sieve bucket fitted, collecting refuse building material and sieving it through the bucket. That refuse was then sorted into categories such as scrap metal, sand and rocks, and either discarded or recycled.
	
	
	In the morning Mr Nadarasa started by sorting sand. He picked up sand with the bucket and sifted through it. While he was doing this Mr Mohammad, Mr Salvaraja and Mr Namsivayam came to the bucket and removed weeds and other materials from the sand. The machine did not move while they were sorting from the bucket. When they had finished sorting they then moved away from the excavator and the excavator then moved the sand onto a pile in the far corner of the site.
	
	
	After completing sorting the sand Mr Nadarasa moved on to start sorting wood. The sorters moved to other areas to work while awaiting the next bin to arrive to be sorted.
	
	
	About noon Mr Nadarasa was seated in the driver’s seat of the excavator near the wood section of the yard. While he was sitting in the compartment of the excavator Mr Nadarasa was facing forward. He noticed Mr Salvaraja and Mr Namsivayam in front of the excavator to his right looking at a TV. Mr Nadarasa also noticed Mr Mohammad in front of the other two workers six or seven feet away from the excavator. Mr Nadarasa then commenced to turn the lever controlling the bucket to the left. As he turned the bucket to the left his line of sight went in the same direction. As he did this the machine also moved backwards away from where he had last seen the other workers standing.
	
	
	Mr Nadarasa did not give any indication he was about to move the machine. He did not consider there was a need to, as he thought that workers were standing in front of the machine.
	
	
	Mr Namsivayam and Mr Salvaraja were standing at the base of a scrap metal pile in the steel and concrete section of the yard. Mr Namasivayam observed Mr Mohammad working parallel to himself and Mr Salvaraja in the sandpit section.
	
	
	Shortly afterwards Mr Salvaraja saw Mr Mohammad with his foot caught in the tracks of the excavator. Mr Mohammad was then knocked down and his foot became pinned beneath the track of the excavator against the ground. The rotation of the track pulled Mr Mohammad's foot further under the track and caused him to fall forward. The leading edge of the track struck Mr Mohammad on the back and hip, and pushed his upper body clear and to the side of the track. The continued rotation of the track caused the lower limbs to rotate and this caused injury to Mr Mohammad’s pelvis.
	
	
	Mr Salvaraja ran to Mr Mohammad and attempted to pull him clear of the track but was unable to, due to Mr Mohammad being pinned.
	
	
	Mr Salvaraja called out to Mr Namsivayam who ran over to assist.
	
	
	Mr Namsivayam, realising Mr Mohammad was unable to be extracted, ran around the excavator and advised Mr Nadarasa, who was unaware of the incident, that Mr Mohammad had been injured. Mr Namsivayam stated that Mr Nadarasa was unable to see or hear what was happening because he was facing the opposite side of the yard and had his back to them. He had to run around the front of the machine and wave and yell at Mr Nadarasa to get his attention.
	
	
	Mr Nadarasa rotated the arm around to the northern side of the excavator and by pushing the bucket down against the ground lifted the track off the ground allowing Mr Mohammad to be pulled free.
	
	
	Mr Mohammad was dragged about 1 metre from the excavator.
	
	
	Once Mr Mohammad was pulled free of the track, Mr Nadarasa lowered the excavator to the ground and shut down the engine before dismounting and going to assist Mr Mohammad. Mr Mohammad was alert and conscious. Mr Nadarasa used his mobile telephone to contact Ms Brooke Zizikas, who was at another site in Lidcombe. She immediately left her location and travelled by car to the site.
	
	
	Ms Zizikas (the wife of Mr Zizikas) arrived about 5 minutes later and when she observed Mr Mohammad she contacted triple zero by mobile telephone.
	
	
	At 12.17pm NSW Police arrived on scene and immediately rendered first aid to Mr Mohammad. Mr Mohammad was conscious but mostly unresponsive. The ambulance arrived at 12.26pm. At 12.27pm Mr Mohammad went into cardiac arrest and CPR was commenced. CPR was continued until 12.50pm when resuscitation efforts were ceased. Mr Mohammad was pronounced deceased at 12.50pm.
	
	
	At the time of the incident Mr Mohammad was wearing a hi-vis yellow work shirt. Toxicology revealed that there was no alcohol in Mr Mohammad’s blood, nor any illicit substances.
	
	
	Mr Nadarasa advised that between the time he had last seen Mr Mohammad and the time of the incident was one to two minutes.
	
	
	Mr Salvaraja advised that the last time he had seen Mr Mohammad prior to the incident was seven or eight minutes before when he was standing with Mr Namsivayam as they broke down the TV. Mr Salvaraja stated that the loader was operating backward and forward during the seven or eight minutes.
	
	
	Mr Namsivayam advised he had last seen Mr Mohammad in the vicinity of the sandpit about 8 to 10 minutes before he was hit by the excavator. Mr Namsivayam advised the distance between where he had last seen Mr Mohammad before he was struck by the excavator and where the excavator was working was approximately 25 to 30 feet.
	


INJURIES AND AFTERMATH


	
	Mr Mohammad suffered fatal injuries.
	


Systems of work prior to the incident 

Work Procedures


	
	No documented systems of work were in place for the work tasks being undertaken at the site.
	
	
	Harris Holdings provided SafeWork NSW with a Transport Operations Manual, which appears to have been developed for Harris Excavation and Transport Pty Ltd, another company of which Mr Zizikas was a director. The manual had not been provided to the workers at the site, nor did it address the operation of the excavator. The manual’s contents are relevant to the operation of a transport company. However the manual included generic forms for completing a pre start inspection checklist, risk assessment and safe work method statement. None of these documents were being used at the site nor had they been completed for the tasks being undertaken at the site.
	
	
	Mr Zizikas was aware of the requirement and need for work health and safety procedures as a Transport Operations Manual had been developed however Mr Zizikas did not ensure that any formal procedures were developed for or put in place at the site.
	
	
	The four workers at the site undertaking sorting were unaware or unclear as to what a risk assessment, safe work method statement and tool box talk were.
	
	
	The WorkCover ‘Code of Practice for Managing the Risks of Plant in the Workplace’ provides guidance in relation to ensuring safe plant. This document was in force and readily available at the time of the incident. The Code of Practice required persons with management or control of plant in the workplace to identify the hazards of the plant, assess the risks and put control measures in place and provide guidance as to how to assess and control the risks of plant in the workplace. No documented risk assessment had been conducted in relation to the operation of the excavator at the site.
	
	
	Australian Standard AS2359.2-2013 Powered Industrial Trucks was available prior to the incident for purchase via Standards Australia’s website. The standard sets out (at clause 3.4) general rules for users and supervisors. These include ensuring all personnel in the vicinity of operating trucks to be made aware of and observe safe working procedures including minimum pedestrian safety requirements and separation distances. No adequate procedures were in place at the site to address separating workers from the moving excavator or other vehicles which accessed the site.
	
	
	The manual for the excavator, Shop Manual Komatsu PC228US-3 PC228USLC-3 which was provided to SafeWork NSW by Harris Holdings included safety rules for changing machine directions which included; “before travelling, check again that there is no one in the surrounding area and that there are no obstacles”; “before travelling sound the horn to warn people in the area”; and “if there is an area to the rear of the machine which cannot be seen, position a signal person. Take special care not to hit other machines or people when turning or swinging the machine”. In relation to swinging, the Manual specifies that “the rear of the machine extends outside track width. Check that the surrounding area is safe before swinging the upper structure”. The safety procedures recommended by the Manual were not in place at the site at the time of the incident.
	
	
	There was a warning sticker attached to the inside of the driver’s cabin which stated:
	


“To prevent SEVERE INJURY or DEATH, do the following before moving machine or its attachments:

- Honk horn to alert people nearby.

- Be sure no one is on or near machine or in swing area.

- Rotate cab for full view of travel path if it can be done safely.

- Use spotter if view is obscured.

Follow the above even is machine equipped with travel alarm and mirrors.”

The safety procedures recommended on the safety warning sticker were not in place at the site at the time of the incident.


	
	The horn on the excavator was not in proper working order at the time of the incident.
	


Traffic management


	
	There was no traffic management plan in place at the site. No exclusion zones for pedestrian workers had been established and no system using a spotter had been established for working in the vicinity of the excavator. Mr Zizikas as sole director of Harris Holdings had not ensured the company had a traffic management plan in place.
	
	
	Technical Guidance Code of Practice 2001 is a WorkCover NSW approved code of practice which provides a practical guide to achieving the standard of safety required by safety legislation. This approved industry code of practice should be followed unless there is an alternative course of action which achieves the same or a better standard of health or safety in the workplace. Australian Standard AS2359.2 -1985 is incorporated into the Code of Practice. Australian Standard AS2359.2-1985 has been superseded by AS2359.2-2013 which commenced on 13 February 2013.
	
	
	Section 3.4, AS 2359.2-2013 Powered Industrial Trucks Part 2: Operations sets out that the purpose of an effective traffic management plan is as far as reasonably practicable, to achieve ‘complete physical separation of trucks and mobile plant from people within the work area’.
	
	
	Section 3.6 AS 2359.2-2013 provides that “a traffic management plan that includes truck operation shall be in place for the site.”
	
	
	Appendix A AS 2359.2-2013 Powered Industrial Trucks Part 2: Operations provides that a sketch or blueprint of the workplace layout is essential to identify, address and evaluate hazards. It further provides a list for guidance on areas for consideration and additional information and guidance for partial separation where total separation cannot be achieved. Among the hazards listed in the Standard to be considered in the traffic management plan are: the identification of areas where people (workers) and trucks may interact; loading and unloading areas of delivery road trucks; and areas where pedestrians may cross the travel paths of trucks. The Standard requires exclusion and separation zones as a measure to address hazards and notes that if total separation is not possible, other control measures include: scheduling the work of trucks and mobile plant for times when pedestrians are not present; signage; physical barriers; and devices providing a clear view of other users such as mirrors and cameras.
	
	
	The General Guide for workplace traffic management published by SafeWork Australia and readily available on their website provides guidance to industry in managing and controlling traffic risks. The Guide notes that the best way to protect pedestrians is to make sure people and vehicles cannot interact. This can be achieved by not allowing vehicles in pedestrian spaces or not allowing pedestrians in vehicle operating areas. If this is not possible people and vehicles can be separated by measures such as high impact traffic control barriers or temporary physical barriers.
	
	
	There were no fences, barriers, barricades, bollards, bunting, witches hats or similar equipment placed in the area around where the excavator was sorting materials, to designate an exclusion zone.
	
	
	Harris Holdings did not enforce an exclusion zone around the excavator. Harris Holdings did not designate a person as a supervisor, who was responsible for enforcing the exclusion zone. The supervisor for the site was the worker operating the excavator.
	
	
	Harris Holdings did not provide instruction, information and training to all workers about the need for, and the operation of, an exclusion zone around the excavator.
	
	
	Mr Zizikas did not ensure that Harris Holdings took the appropriate steps.
	


Communication


	
	No system of work was in place at the site which required the sorters to communicate with the excavator driver when there was any change in their location. No procedure was in place at the site requiring the excavator operator to indicate to or communicate with the sorters on the occasions the excavator was to move.
	


Training


	
	Workers at the site, including Mr Mohammad and Mr Nadarasa received onsite verbal training from Mr Zizikas and other workers. Training was not documented.
	
	
	Mr Nadarasa had been operating the excavator for three years at the site. Mr Nadarasa was trained in the operation of the excavator by a previous worker who had operated the machine before him. He was shown some paperwork by the other worker, which he could not remember much about, and was shown how to check the oil and water and use the levers and pedals of the excavator. After that he was shown by Mr Zizikas how to change the bucket and move forward and backward. Mr Nadarasa had no further training on how to operate the machine. Mr Nadarasa was not provided with the manual for the excavator nor were the contents read and explained to him.
	
	
	Mr Zizikas did not ensure that Harris Holdings provided appropriate and clear training to workers at the site.
	


Maintenance and visibility


	
	Mr Nadarasa carried out the pre operational checks on the excavator. Mr Nadarasa advised this involved checking the water and the oil only. He was not provided with a documented checklist to complete. The manual for the excavator specified that prior to operating the machine the checks to be made included: remove all dirt from the window glass to ensure a good view; check mirror adjustment so that the rear of the machine can be seen from the operator’s seat; check that there are no persons or obstacles above, below, or in the area around the machine.
	
	
	Following the incident a full mechanical inspection of the excavator was carried out by Komatsu technicians. A total of 93 defects with the excavator were noted. Relevant to the incident these included: 2 side mirrors were missing; a rear mirror was missing; a revolving beacon was not illuminating and windows were dusty. Further the switch for the horn of the excavator was sticking when “on” was pressed and would continuously sound so once activated the horn could not be deactivated.
	
	
	The excavator involved in the incident had limited visibility at the time of the incident. Mr Nadarasa could see in front of the excavator and on the left side. Visibility was severely restricted behind the excavator and to the right (primarily due to the arm of the machine). The missing mirrors and dusty windows increased the poor visibility issues with the excavator.
	
	
	The Code of Practice for excavation work also requires mobile plant operating near ground personnel to be equipped with warning devices such as a reversing alarm and revolving light.
	
	
	Mr Zizikas did not ensure that Harris Holdings provided equipment which was maintained in accordance with its operator’s manual and had all required safety features in place.
	


Systems of work following the incident


	
	A number of changes were made to the systems of work at the site by Harris Holdings after the incident.
	
	
	Harris Holdings purchased a new excavator for the sum of $45,000. This was a much smaller machine.
	
	
	The new excavator was fitted with a number of additional safety features. These include a reversing camera and a travel alarm.
	
	
	Harris Holdings introduced formal toolbox talks with the labourers at the site each morning.
	
	
	A number of new safety documents were introduced.
	
	
	A WHSE Hazard Identification Risk Assessment & Control (HIRAC) Worksheet was completed on 20 April 2016 in respect of the tipping and sorting operation at the site.
	
	
	Job Safety Plans have been developed. These comprise of JSAs, Safe Work Method Statement and Safe Work Instructions. These cover the processes for the site operations.
	
	
	Relevantly, these include a SWMS/JSA for the Work Activity of ‘Delivery and Retrieval of Skip Bins’ – SWMS No.003 Rev No.2 April 2016 and SWMS/JSA for the Work Activity of ‘Waste Material Processing’ – SWMS No. 004 Rev No.2 September 2016.
	
	
	The SWMS/ JSA for the Work Activity of ‘Waste Material Processing’ includes Hazard Control measure for material sorting which include:
	



	
	Maintain exclusion zone between workers and plant while plant is in operation.
	
	
	Ensure plant is secured and switched off before workers enter the exclusion zone.
	
	
	Use fencing, barriers, barricades, temporary warning or control signs.
	
	
	Ensure hi-vis safety vests and other PPE is worn
	
	
	Emergency response procedure
	
	
	Take periodic rest breaks
	
	
	Follow correct lifting techniques.
	
	
	Wear appropriate PPE such as gloves, respiratory apparatus, long pants, long sleeve shirt, steel capped safety boots, and hard hat.
	



	
	In respect to the procedure for ‘Excavator Operations’ the SWMS/JSA for the Work Activity of ‘Waste Material Processing’ states:
	



	
	Maintain exclusion zone between workers and plant whilst plant is in operation.
	
	
	Ensure plant is secured and switched off before workers enter the exclusion zone.
	
	
	Use fencing, barriers, barricades, temporary warning or control signs.
	
	
	Ensure hi-vis safety vests and other PPE is worn
	
	
	Emergency response procedure.
	



	
	The above Harris Holdings safety documents were translated into Tamil for the labourers.
	
	
	The labourers at the Site were inducted and trained in the content of the JSA/SWMS.
	
	
	A Site Safety Management Plan was developed and implemented in July 2016. This plan included details in relation to Health and Safety Planning, Plant Operation, Site Safety Inspections, and WHS audits.
	
	
	The labourers at the Site were inducted and trained in the content of the Site Safety Management Plan.
	
	
	A WHSE Hazard Identification Risk Assessment & Control (HIRAC) Worksheet was also completed on 20 September 2016 at the Harris Holdings Workshop, Office and Yard at the 107 Church Street site.
	
	
	A Traffic Management Plan was developed and implemented in September 2016. In order to determine traffic management related risk, a Traffic Management Risk Assessment Checklist was completed and Risk Assessment Matrix was compiled which detailed specific risks and controls relevant to the workplace.
	
	
	The Traffic Management Plan included matters relating to Pedestrian Safety, Mobile Plant and Equipment, Loading and Unloading Activities, and had attached site safety rules.
	
	
	The Traffic Management Plan included a requirement that reversing of trucks must be controlled by a trained spotter, and audible alarms and flashing lights fitted. There was also a requirement for barriers to be put into place for the separation of people and plant via pedestrian walkways.
	
	
	A site map was also developed which indicated restricted areas for people and plant. This includes a designated ‘Loading Zone’, a ‘Plant Exclusion Zone’, a ‘Sorting Area’ and a ‘Pedestrian Exclusion Zone’.
	
	
	The labourers at the Site were trained in the Traffic Management Plan and the various zones at the site. A map was developed to explain the zones. Compliance with zones is enforced by Harris Holding management and supervisors.
	
	
	When loading and unloading tasks are being undertaken at the site the labourers now have to stand in a pedestrian zone. This zone is designated as a ‘plant exclusion zone’. Prior to a truck commencing tipping activities the driver is required to sound its horn. Once all labourers have moved to the pedestrian zone, the truck driver commences the tipping operation. The truck driver sounds the horn again when they have concluded tipping operations.
	
	
	Once the truck has ceased its activities, the labourers then move into the area of the tipped material and make a decision on how to process the material.
	
	
	The labourers are then required to move to a location in front of the excavator and out of the zone of operation of the excavator, prior to it commencing operation. The excavator operator then sounds the horn to notify the workers that operations are about to commence. At that point any labourer who is not already in the pedestrian zone must move to the zone. The excavator operator then sounds the horn to notify the workers that operations are about to commence. At that point any labourer who is not already in the pedestrian zone must move to that zone. The excavator operator then picks up a bucket of material and commences to sort it. The excavator operator is also required to sound the horn prior to the excavator swinging around. There is an exclusion zone where no employee is to go when the excavator is in operation.
	
	
	The labourers can only move into the sorting area when the excavator operator has stopped the operation of the excavator and placed the bucket on the ground.
	
	
	Mr Zizikas now operates the excavator at the site during sorting operations. This is to ensure that the work is undertaken safely and in accordance with the revised safety procedures and the Traffic Management Plan.
	


THE OFFENDER’S EVIDENCE


	
	The evidence for both defendants came from the affidavits of Mr Zizikas sworn 19 October 2017 and 25 October 2017. His evidence in relation to the system of work before the incident, and the improvements to that system since the incident, has been recorded above in the Agreed Statement of Facts.
	
	
	Harris Holdings was registered as a company on 28 June 2013. Mr Zizikas was appointed as a director on 4 February 2014. He personally has worked in the excavation, demolition and haulage industries for over 25 years. Mr Zizikas has been the hands-on manager of Harris Holdings, which has up to 25 employees.
	
	
	Neither he nor Harris Holdings has ever been prosecuted or fined or had any investigations conducted by Safework or Workcover. He has owned and operated businesses at the site since 1994.
	
	
	Mr Zizikas expressed contrition and remorse for the incident. He has accepted his responsibility for the failures of the business which resulted in the unfortunate death of Mr Mohammed. I accept that both he and Harris Holdings are genuinely contrite concerning the incident. I also accept that both he and Harris Holdings co-operated with Safework and other regulatory authorities, and entered a guilty plea at the earliest possible opportunity, which is when the prosecution and the defence had agreed on the appropriate Statement of Facts to be put before the court.
	
	
	In his first affidavit Mr Zizikas gave evidence concerning a significant drop in income of Harris Holdings in the 2017 year. He said that he had concerns for the ongoing solvency of the business if the court imposes a significant fine on the company. He said that a significant fine “may be the final nail in the coffin which will mean that I will have to close down the company and put off the employees that are currently employed by the company”.
	
	
	In his written Outline of Submissions, counsel for both defendants submitted that both Harris Holdings and Mr Zizikas had limited means to pay any fine, let alone one of some substance. Counsel referred me to s 6 of the Fines Act 1996.
	
	
	Annexed to the first Zizikas affidavit was a document said to be the financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2016 of Harris Holdings. It was unsigned. It was unaudited. One of the current liabilities in the balance sheet as at 30 June 2016 was a tax liability for a “GST payable control account” of $154,925.14. The second Zizikas affidavit attached an itemised account from the Australian Taxation Office for Harris Holdings. That document stated that as at 30 June 2016 the amount owing to the tax office by the company was $406,032.74. No explanation was provided as to why that figure was not reflected in the financial statements for Harris Holdings for the year ended 30 June 2016.
	
	
	Those statements had the usual provisions for a declaration to be made by the director of Harris Holdings that the accounts give a true and fair picture of the company’s financial position and that there are reasonable grounds to believe the company would be able to pay its debts as and when they become due and payable. That declaration was not signed, nor were the financial statements signed by the company’s accountant. The page for the accountant to sign referred to the statements being “special purpose financial statements” but the meaning of this phrase was not explained. The accountant’s page for signature also stated that the purpose for which the statements had been prepared were set out in “Note 1” to the financial statements, but no such note was attached.
	
	
	The 2016 financial statements set out current assets and current liabilities, but did not disclose any non-current assets or non-current liabilities. There is no evidence in that financial statement of the company being indebted to any bank.
	
	
	The matter was first listed for hearing on Monday, 23 October 2017. I raised with counsel for the defendants that:
	



	
	It appeared that there were several companies in the Harris Group and that the financial statements only covered Harris Holdings and not the other companies;
	
	
	In those circumstances it was difficult to know what the true financial position of Harris Holdings was;
	
	
	Further, there was no evidence whatsoever as to the financial position of Mr Zizikas personally.
	



	
	Counsel for the defendant sought, and was granted, an adjournment of the sentence hearing until Friday, 27 October 2017, and was granted leave to file further affidavit material. This was done in the form of the second affidavit, being that sworn on 25 October 2017.
	
	
	The first Zizikas affidavit also attached two pages of a balance sheet for Harris Holdings as at 30 June 2017. The current tax liability was said to be $207,965.84. The itemised account of the Australian Taxation Office showed that as at that date the amount owing to the tax office was $624,611.37. No explanation was provided for the difference between these two figures.
	
	
	Further, the balance sheet dealt only with current assets and current liabilities and said nothing about any non-current assets or non-current liabilities. There was thus no evidence of any borrowings from any bank contained in the balance sheet.
	
	
	The second Zizikas affidavit, sworn 25 October 2017, dealt with and attached financial material relating to the other companies in the Harris Group.
	
	
	The financial material in relation to the various companies had the following features. Firstly, the financial statements for each company for the year ended 30 June 2017 were stamped “draft” on the first page. Secondly, the director’s declaration was unsigned. Thirdly, the accountant’s signature page was unexecuted. Fourthly, the accounts were said to have been compiled for a special purpose set out in “Note 1”, but no such note was attached.
	
	
	The site where the incident occurred at 160 Arthur Street, Homebush West is owned by Brohar Pty Limited as Trustee for the Brohar Unit Trust. Ms Brooke Zizikas, the wife of Mr Zizikas, is the director of Brohar. There was no evidence as to the value of that property.
	
	
	The family home at 26 Queens Street, Croydon is owned solely by Ms Brooke Zizikas. It is valued at $1,400,000. There is a mortgage which secures two loans which total $845,000.
	
	
	Mr Zizikas deposed in relation to his personal financial position as follows:
	


“66. I am supposed to be paid a salary about $150,000 per annum from the Harris Group.

67. Often, I am not paid my salary if there is no money to pay me. Most of the cash that flows into the business predominantly goes back into the business to pay for wages, parts, material and diesel whenever the companies fall behind. Sometimes I am paid from another business if cash flow permits.”


	
	Mr Zizikas attached copies of his tax return summary and Notice of Assessment for the year ended 30 June 2017. In that year he was paid $150,800, from which PAYG tax credits of $46,728 were deducted. Those PAYG credits were apparently paid by his employers, as the only amount due on the notice was a minor adjustment of $255.30.
	
	
	The tax return summary from the Australian Taxation Office also disclosed that Ms Brooke Zizikas had a taxable income in that year of $102,000. Thus between them husband and wife have a taxable income of $252,800.
	
	
	There was no evidence of the expenses which the couple have, either in relation to their substantial mortgage, or in relation to running the household which consists of themselves and four young children.
	
	
	The company Harris Bulk Haulage Pty Limited has recently entered into a bulk haulage contract with Holcim Australia. This is a five year contract to haul quarry material requiring five trucks and trailers. This contract was made in mid-July 2017. Thus the income does not turn up in the financial statements of that company put before the court. However, in the 2017 financial year that company was profitable enough to transfer $755,950 to Harris Holdings and still make a profit of $82,865.12 on income of $1,308,956.57. That company appears to have no bank borrowings. Mr Zizikas owns the only share in Harris Bulk Haulage Pty Limited. He is also a director of that company.
	
	
	A current ASIC search shows that Mr Zizikas is also a director of: Arthur Street Property Investments Pty Limited, Harris Plant Hire Pty Limited and Harris Trailers Pty Limited. In fact, the only company in the group where he has ceased to be a director is Harris Holdings.
	
	
	The current sole director of Harris Holdings is Roula Zizikas who has the same address as Mr Zizikas at 26 Queen Street, Croydon. Apart from the court being told that Roula Zizikas is a “family member”, nothing else was put before the court concerning that person. She was not present during the sentence hearing.
	


Consideration


	
	I have had regard to the objects of the Act set out in Section 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and the purposes of sentencing set out in Section 3A.
	


Objective Seriousness of the Offence


	
	The proportionality principle requires that a sentence should neither exceed nor be less than the gravity of the crime having regard to the objective circumstances: Veen v R (No. 2) (1998) 164 CLR 465 at 472, 485-6, 490-1 and 496. At common law, the term “objective circumstances” was used to describe the circumstances of the crime. The gravity of the offence was assessed by reference to its objective seriousness: R v McNaughton (2006) 66 NSWLR 566 at [15].
	
	
	The task requires the court to consider where in the range of conduct covered by the offence the conduct of the offender falls: Baumer v R (1998) 166 CLR 51 at 57. This assessment will generally indicate the appropriate range of sentences available which will reflect the objective seriousness of the offence committed, and set the limits within which a sentence proportional to the criminality of the offender will lie: BW v R [2011] NSWCCA 176 at [70].
	
	
	The sentencing judge should take into account not only the conduct which actually constitutes the crime, but also such of the surrounding circumstances as are directly related to that crime and are properly regarded as circumstances of aggravation or mitigation: R v Wilkinson (No. 5) [2009] NSWSC 432 at [61].
	
	
	The existence of a reasonably foreseeable risk to safety that is likely to result in serious injury or death is a factor relative to the gravity of the offence: Capral Aluminium Limited v WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (2000) 49 NSWLR 610 at [89]. The question of foreseeability of the risk is to be determined objectively.
	
	
	The Court of Criminal Appeal has recently examined the sentencing process with regard to the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 in the matter of Nash v Silver City Drilling (NSW) Pty Limited; Attorney General for NSW v Silver City Drilling (NSW) Pty Limited [2017] NSWCCA 96; 93 NSWLR 338. His Honour Justice Basten at paragraph 34, under the heading ‘Assessment of Risk’ said:
	


“The sentencing judge commenced his consideration with the proposition that “greater culpability attaches to the failure to guard against an event the occurrence of which is probable rather than an event the occurrence of which is extremely unlikely”. However the truth of that proposition depends upon other considerations including:

(a)   the potential consequences of the risk, which may be mild or catastrophic;

(b)   the availability of steps to lessen, minimise or remove the risk; and

(c)   whether such steps are complex and burdensome or only mildly inconvenient. Relative culpability depends on assessment of all those factors.”


	
	Further at paragraph 42 his Honour continued:
	


“The culpability of the Respondent is not necessarily to be determined by the remoteness of the risk occurring, nor by a step‑by‑step assessment of the various elements. Culpability will turn upon an overall evaluation of various factors, which may pull in different directions. Culpability in this case is reasonably high because, even if the pressure event of the force which occurred might not be expected to occur often, the seriousness of the foreseeable resultant harm is extreme and the steps to be taken to avoid it, were not even assessed, were straightforward and involved only minor inconvenience and little, if any, costs.”


	
	My findings about the offenders’ level of culpability are based upon the following:
	



	
	It was reasonably practicable for the defendants to ensure the health and safety of the worker by ensuring that an exclusion or “no go” zone was maintained in the vicinity of the excavator.
	
	
	There were no fences, barriers, barricades, bollards, bunting, witches hats or similar equipment placed in the area around where the excavator was sorting materials to designate an exclusion zone.
	
	
	There was no designated person who was responsible for enforcing an exclusion zone. The supervisor for the site was the worker operating the excavator.
	
	
	Harris Holdings did not provide instruction, information and training to any workers about the need for, and the operation of, an exclusion zone around the excavator;
	
	
	The operating manual for the excavator had not been read and/or explained to operators;
	
	
	No steps were taken to ensure that the operators of the excavator understood what pre checks were required to be carried out on the excavator prior to operating it;
	
	
	It was reasonably practicable for the defendant to ensure that the excavator was in working condition. A total of 93 defects with the excavator were noted on inspection. The defects which affected the safety of operations could have been readily repaired;
	
	
	No system of work was in place at the site which required the sorters to communicate with the excavator driver when there was any change in their location.
	
	
	No procedure was in place at the site requiring the excavator operator to indicate or communicate to the sorters when the excavator was about to move.
	
	
	The cost of overcoming the risk would have been negligible as a communication procedure could have been readily developed and used;
	
	
	Mr Mohammad received undocumented on-site verbal training only;
	
	
	The four workers at the site undertaking sorting were unaware or unclear as to what a risk assessment, a safe work method statement and a tool box talk were.
	
	
	Mr Mohammad and the other workers were placed at risk of death or serious injury, being the risk of being struck, crushed, thrown and/ or otherwise injured by the excavator;
	
	
	The existence of the risk was known or should have been known as the risk was identified in:
	



	
	the WorkCover ‘Code of Practice for Managing the Risks of Plant in the Workplace’ which provides guidance in relation to ensuring safe plant;
	
	
	the Australian Standard AS2359.2-2013 Powered Industrial Trucks; and
	
	
	the manual for the excavator, Shop Manual Komatsu PC228US-3 PC228USLC-3
	
	
	the warning sticker attached to the inside of the driver’s cabin;
	
	
	the General Guide for workplace traffic management published by SafeWork Australia;
	
	
	the Transport Operations Manual. This had been developed for Harris Excavation and Transport Pty Ltd but had not been provided to the workers at the site, nor did it address the operation of the excavator.
	



	
	The risk of this accident happening was an obvious risk.
	
	
	The likelihood of the risk coming home was quite high.
	
	
	Simple remedial steps were available which would have completely avoided the risk.
	
	
	The fatal injuries sustained by Mr Mohammad on 26 November 2015 were a manifestation of the risk.
	
	
	I find that the level of culpability of both offenders is in the mid-range.
	


Deterrence


	
	The penalty imposed in relation to this offence must provide for general deterrence. Employers must take the obligations imposed by the Act very seriously. The community is entitled to expect that both small and large employers will comply with safety requirements. General deterrence is a significant factor when safety obligations are breached: Bulga Underground Operations Pty Limited v Nash (2016) NSWCCA 37 at [180].
	
	
	The penalty must reflect the need for specific deterrence. The offender is still conducting a business. Many of its operations involve the use of potentially dangerous equipment. It still has a number of employees.
	


Aggravating Factors


	
	The injury, caused by the offence was substantial: s 21A(2)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	


MITIGATING FACTORS


	
	Neither offender has previous convictions, so they do not have a significant record of previous convictions: Section 21A(3)(e) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
	
	
	Both the offenders were otherwise of good character: Section 21A(3)(f) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The steps which the offenders took after the incident demonstrate this. Harris Holdings has been in operation since 2013. Mr Zizikas has been in business for 25 years.
	
	
	The offenders are unlikely to re-offend: Section 21A(3(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	The offenders have good prospects of rehabilitation: Section 21A(3)(h) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The offenders have taken positive steps to guard against the risk of an incident such as this ever happening again. Harris Holdings has brought its documentation and its procedures into line with those which, on all the evidence, should have been in place before this accident occurred.
	
	
	The offenders have shown remorse for the offence: Section 21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The offenders have provided evidence through Mr Zizikas that they have accepted responsibility for their actions and have acknowledged that the injury to Mr Mohammad was caused by their actions.
	
	
	The offenders entered pleas of guilty: Section 21A(3)(k) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The court must take into account the fact that the offenders have pleaded guilty, when they pleaded guilty, and the circumstances in which they indicated an intention to plead guilty: Section 22(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. In my view the offenders entered the pleas of guilty at the earliest possible opportunity, as soon as the facts were agreed with the prosecutor. It is appropriate to apply a discount of 25%.
	
	
	The offenders gave assistance to law enforcement authorities: Section 21A(3)(m) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The offenders co-operated at all times with the prosecutor and provided all documents requested in a prompt fashion.
	


Capacity to Pay a Fine


	
	I am required to have regard to Section 6 Fines Act 1996 before imposing a fine. Where an offender seeks to have a fine reduced on the basis of a limited capacity to pay, it bears the evidentiary onus of convincing the Court that it should exercise its discretion to limit the amount of the fine. The offender’s capacity to pay is relevant but not decisive: Jahandideh v R [2014] NSWCCA 178 at [16]. A substantial fine may still be warranted as a result of the seriousness of the offence and the need for general deterrence.
	
	
	Both offenders submitted that they had limited means to pay any fine, let alone one of some substance.
	
	
	I find that neither defendant has discharged the evidentiary onus to satisfy me that I should reduce the fines which I would otherwise impose. So far as Mr Zizikas personally is concerned, the only evidence I have about his financial circumstances is that he has an actual income in the financial year ended 30 June 2017 of over $150,000 gross subject to the deductions for PAYG tax instalments. These have been paid by his employers. I have no evidence whatsoever concerning his expenses.
	
	
	So far as Harris Holdings is concerned, I have been presented with incomplete, unsigned and unaudited financial statements. Those statements raise more questions than they answer. However, the financial statements put before me demonstrate that Mr Zizikas has the ability to cause large sums of money to be paid from one company in the Harris Group to another. In relation to the payment of $755,950 from Harris Bulk Haulage to Harris Holdings, he said:
	


“The management fees of $755,950 shown in the profit and loss statements is an accounting entry shown as an expense from Harris Bulk Haulage and shown as income in Harris Holdings so that Harris Holdings can meet its liabilities and debts.”


	
	Whatever be the accuracy of that statement, it demonstrates that he has the ability to fund one company from the income of another.
	
	
	Further, the incomplete financial statements of Harris Holdings put before the court show that there are no substantial bank borrowings, and in those circumstances it may well be that Harris Holdings, or some other company in the group controlled by Mr Zizikas, can borrow to fund a corporate expense, including any fine imposed.
	
	
	Mr Zizikas in his first affidavit said that any significant fine for the company may result in it being closed down. The loss of over $300,000 shown in the financial statements for Harris Holdings in financial year ended 30 June 2017 has not caused it to be closed down. Nor has the tax debt of over $600,000. Finally, while the accounts are unsigned, Mr Zizikas put them forward attached to his affidavits as accurate documents. I take it from that that he asserts on behalf of each company that the company is not insolvent and can pay its debts as and when they fall due.
	
	
	In the light of those matters I consider that the information regarding the means of both defendants which was made available to the court was not such as to demonstrate that the court should exercise any discretion to reduce the amount of an otherwise appropriate fine.
	


Costs


	
	The parties have agreed to an order that the offenders are to pay the prosecutor’s costs as agreed or assessed.
	


Penalty for harris holdings


	
	The offender is convicted.
	
	
	The appropriate fine is $400,000 but that will be reduced by 25% to reflect the plea of guilty.
	
	
	I impose a fine of $300,000.
	
	
	I order pursuant to Section 122(2) of the Fines Act 1996 that 50% of the fine is to be paid to the prosecutor.
	
	
	I order the offender to pay the prosecutor’s costs as agreed or assessed.
	


PENALTY FOR MR ZIZIKAS


	
	The offender is convicted.
	
	
	The appropriate fine is $80,000 but that will be reduced by 25% to reflect the plea of guilty.
	
	
	I impose a fine of $60,000.
	
	
	I order pursuant to Section 122(2) of the Fines Act 1996 that 50% of the fine is to be paid to the prosecutor.
	
	
	I order the offender to pay the prosecutor’s costs as agreed or assessed.

		02 November 2017",2017-11-01 00:00:00,NSW District Court
6320386,R v Candace Martin [2017] NSWSC 1498,"Judgment


	
	On 12 September 2017 Candace Martin entered pleas of guilty to one count of attempted murder on 7 April 2014 (count 1) and a second count of being an accessory after the fact to murder on 13 June 2014 “and other days following” (count 3). The indictment on which she was arraigned included an offence of murder (count 2). The Crown indicated that it would accept the pleas of guilty to counts 1 and 3 in full discharge of the indictment and Ms Martin was discharged in relation to the murder count.
	
	
	Each of the offences to which Ms Martin pleaded guilty carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. [1]  Those maximum penalties must be kept in mind throughout the sentencing process for the reasons explained by the High Court in Markarian v The Queen. [2]  A second significant legislative yardstick is the standard non-parole period of 10 years which applies to the attempted murder charge. [3]  The way in which the standard non-parole period must be applied is well established. [4] 
	
	
	Remaining cognizant of these legislative guideposts is particularly important in a case such as the present where a compelling “subjective” case has been presented on behalf of the offender. Sentencing in such circumstances is difficult, but the sentencing Judge must not allow the tragic personal circumstances of an offender or their family to lead to the imposition of a sentence that is unjust, erroneously lenient or otherwise disproportionate to the gravity of the offending. However moving the circumstances of an offender and their family, a sentencing Judge must be guided by the purposes of sentencing set out in s 3A of the Sentencing Act.   
	
	
	Ms Martin’s involvement in the two crimes arose out of her marriage to Micheal Phillip Martin. The victim of both offences was Mr Martin’s father (Michael Anthony Martin, to whom I will generally refer as “the deceased”). [5]  She was originally arraigned with Mr Martin (and another co-accused) but applied for, and was granted, a separate trial. [6]  Mr Martin stood trial in Lismore between 4 September 2017 and 25 October 2017. It was part way through that trial that the parties asked for Ms Martin to be re-arraigned. Previously, on 3 August 2017, Ms Martin entered pleas of guilty to being an accessory after the fact to both the attempted murder and the murder. The Crown did not accept those pleas of guilty. In the first week that Mr Martin’s trial was listed (28 August 2017), there were negotiations between Ms Martin’s lawyers and the Crown. Ms Martin offered to give evidence against her husband. Those negotiations broke down late that week. Ms Martin repeated her offer to give evidence against her husband when she entered her pleas on 12 September 2017. However, the Crown Prosecutor decided not to call her to give evidence.
	
	
	The facts were largely agreed between the parties and a document styled “Agreed Facts” with a number of annexures was tendered without objection. [7]  The annexures included a number of recorded interviews between Ms Martin and police as well as two transcripts of conversations that were covertly recorded by listening device. The following summary of the facts is based on the material tendered in the present sentencing proceedings. While I presided over Mr Martin’s trial (which resulted in verdicts of guilty on 25 October 2017), the extensive evidence adduced in that trial does not inform the findings of facts made here or the approach I take to sentencing the offender. The evidence in each case is different.
	
	
	There remained factual controversies particularly concerning the offender’s motives for committing the crimes. Ms Martin’s case is that she was acting as a result of some form of duress arising from her husband’s violence and the dysfunctional nature of the marriage. The Crown’s case is that she was motivated by greed or, at least, that her motivations were complex and included a desire to reap the financial benefits of an insurance policy (or policies) that was (or were) taken out over the deceased’s life a couple of months before the first attempt to murder him.8 A large body of evidence relevant to that question was tendered and this included the evidence of Ms Martin herself. I accept some parts, but not all, of her evidence.
	


the facts


	
	Mr Martin was estranged from the deceased who had treated him badly as a child. The evidence of Ms Martin, which I accept, is that her husband told her on many occasions, and in graphic and ugly terms, that he hated his father. Some time in late 2013 or early 2014, contact between father and son was re-established. Then, in February 2014, Mr Martin took out three insurance policies against the accidental or violent death of his father. These policies provided for benefits in the sums of $1million, $1million and $500,000 respectively in the event of the death of the deceased in particular circumstances. In two of the policies, the benefit would go to the estate (of which Mr Martin was one of three beneficiaries). In a $1 million policy taken out with Clearview Wealth Limited, Mr Martin was the nominated beneficiary.
	


The attempted murder


	
	Ms Martin admits that she was aware that her husband had taken out the Clearview insurance policy. She was also aware that her husband wanted to kill his father. Initially, she disagreed with his plan to kill his father. After he made an apparent suicide attempt on 20 December 2013, Ms Martin told her husband:
	


“You do what you gotta do, and I’ll just cover your arse.”


	
	On 6 April 2014, the pair had lunch with the deceased at a hotel in Murwillumbah. After lunch, they gave the deceased and his flatmate a five-litre bottle of home made whiskey. The deceased was known to be an alcoholic. The couple returned with their children to their home in Esk in Queensland.
	
	
	Mr Martin then returned to Murwillumbah and went with other people to the deceased’s flat. When he answered the door, the deceased was stabbed in the eye and fell to the ground. He was stabbed to the neck and physically assaulted about the face, head and body.
	
	
	The deceased sustained life-threatening injuries and would have died but for the medical treatment he received at Tweed Heads and Gold Coast Hospitals. He lost the sight in his left eye from a penetrating injury. Both of his lungs collapsed. There was a penetrating wound to the right side of the neck and fractures to the cheekbones, zygoma, nasal bones and mandible. As a result of this combination of serious injuries, he suffered complications and was placed on life support to ensure blood flow to his vital organs. He suffered ischemic gut (dead bowel) and this required surgical intervention. He required dialysis for renal failure. He developed septic shock. He was not released from the Intensive Care Unit until 9 May 2014.
	
	
	Ms Martin’s role in this attempt to murder her father-in-law involved her agreement to cover up her husband’s part of the crime and in providing her husband with an alibi (or attempting to do so). During the visit to New South Wales in the days before the attack, the couple bought a ring and posted a photograph of the item on Facebook on the evening of 6 April 2014. In response to friends’ comments on the photograph, Ms Martin posted replies that suggested that Mr Martin was with her later that night, thus setting up a false alibi.
	
	
	Ms Martin’s conduct had the capacity of emboldening Mr Martin and was calculated to assist and encourage him in his attempt to murder his father to obtain a substantial sum of money. While I accept the Crown’s submission that her role was important, it was not as the Crown implied central to the commission of the offence. It was put that “the offence simply could not have been committed in the way that it was without the agreement of the offender”. [8]  While that may literally be true, it is likely that her husband would have proceeded with his plan without her assistance, encouragement or approval. As Mr Healy submitted, the best evidence to support that finding is the fact that her husband proceeded to murder his father on 13 June 2014 without the offender’s knowledge, approval, involvement or assistance.
	
	
	Ms Martin’s evidence of her knowledge and belief surrounding her husband’s actions on 6-7 April 2014 was inconsistent and unsatisfactory. At times, I was concerned that her evidence was inconsistent with her plea of guilty. At some stages she suggested that she believed that her husband would not proceed with his plan to kill his father. She agreed, however, that this was more of a hope than a belief. [9]  Later, she gave the following evidence: [10] 
	


“Q. And that paragraph says that that enabled him to rely on those posts as suggesting that he was at home with you or that indeed I think you said in evidence yesterday that he had made those posts?

A. He put the ring up initially and I responded in comments yes but it was joint Facebook account.

Q. I understand that but did you not say yesterday that the way the posts were written would make it appear that he was--

A. Correct.

Q. --making the post?

A. Yes.

Q. And was that to provide him, as seems to be implied in the last sentence, to enable him to assert an alibi, namely that he was with you at home in Esk in Queensland when in fact he was somewhere else?

A. It was a cautionary measure like I put it as a just in case, you know, all night I was hoping he’d [come] back in that driveway but I guess yes as a ‘just in case’. I was - yeah--

Q. Just in case he murdered his father, is that what you mean?

A. Maybe at the time, yes.”


	
	I do not accept the suggestion that Ms Martin acted purely as a result of duress on the part of her husband. The evidence in support of that suggestion in relation to the attempted murder charge is scanty and self-serving.
	
	
	The attack itself was a brutal one and the victim was assaulted in his own home. [11]  The offence was committed, at least in part, for financial gain although the offender’s motives were complex. [12]  The medical consequences of the attack were dire. Notwithstanding the brutality of the attempted murder and the financial motivation that lay behind it, I accept that the limited role played by the offender is such that the criminality falls below the putative “middle of the range of seriousness” for the purposes of the application of the standard non-parole period of 10 years. However, it does not fall very far below that range.
	


The murder


	
	After his release from hospital, the deceased stayed with his former partner and their two children for a period. That situation did not last due to tensions in the household and the deceased claimed that he was “kicked out”. In any event, on 11 June 2014 Mr Martin picked up his father and took him to Esk. They stayed at Ms Martin’s house for a day and then travelled to Murwillumbah on Thursday 12 June 2014, ostensibly to pick up the deceased’s property. Mr Martin and his father stayed at the same unit where the attack on 7 April 2014 took place in spite of the fact that it remained in a very poor condition with blood stains and fingerprint dust on walls, floors and furniture.
	
	
	During the course of the evening Mr Martin murdered his father using a samurai sword. A post mortem examination disclosed multiple (12) incised and penetrating stab wounds. There were four stab wounds to the chest, four incised wounds to the head, neck and shoulder and four defensive wounds to the left arm.
	
	
	At around 5am a neighbour (Mr Collingwood) found Mr Martin at the bottom of the external stairs to the unit. He was bound with black tape by the wrists, legs and over his eyes. Mr Collingwood helped to free him and Mr Martin said “Oh my Dad is up there, they got my dad. I think he’s dead.” Messrs Martin and Collingwood went upstairs, saw the dead body and contacted emergency services. Mr Martin was interviewed as a victim and was taken to hospital suffering from superficial abrasions to the face and back and a small lump to the forehead.
	
	
	According to the Agreed Facts, “Ms Martin became aware that Mr Martin was responsible for killing his father” “after” the latter’s death. [13]  Ms Martin said (in an induced statement) that she found out that Mr Martin had murdered his father on 20 June 2014 (a week after the murder). This was when she saw him grinding a samurai sword and had a conversation with him in which he, implicitly but clearly, admitted that he was the murderer. [14]  I proceed on the factual basis that Ms Martin did not know until that time that her husband had decided to go ahead, or re-instigate, his plan.
	
	
	A claim was made on the Clearview policy on 15 July 2014. Ms Martin witnessed her husband’s signature on the claim form, even though she knew that he was responsible for his father’s murder.
	


Accessory after – assistance provided to the principal


	
	From 20 June 2014 until around mid-April 2015, Ms Martin failed to disclose to police her knowledge of her husband’s involvement in the murder. Further, she actively misled investigators in the course of a number of conversations with them. After his arrest, she attended the police station to protest his innocence.
	
	
	In addition to those matters, she promised her husband that she would attempt to retrieve a potentially incriminating letter from his office. She attended the office, presumably with that objective, but did not attempt to approach the desk where the letter was located. Nor did she ask any of Mr Martin’s work colleagues to retrieve the letter. Later she told her husband that she had attended the office but the letter was not there.
	
	
	At some stage before March 2015, Ms Martin made admissions to her housemate Stephanie Broad. In a part of her evidence that I accept, Ms Martin said this happened after a violent fight between her and her husband. Ms Broad told police of the admission on 20 March 2015 and, on 8 April 2015, consented to being part of a covert action that led to the recording of a conversation with Ms Martin later that day. In that conversation, [15]  Ms Martin implored Ms Broad not to tell police about the admissions and her knowledge of the actions of her husband. Ms Broad encouraged Ms Martin to speak to police and tell them what she knew. Ms Martin explained, or attempted to explain, her reasons for not informing police of what she knew about her husband’s involvement in the murder. Her reasons were complex and included her fear of her husband who, she said, had threatened her and “come at me with a knife”. She was also concerned for the couple’s young children and did not want to “[put] their dad behind bars.”
	
	
	After this conversation, the listening device was switched off or removed. An arrangement was made between the women to meet again. There was a further conversation that was not recorded but its contents were agreed between the parties. [16]  In that conversation Ms Martin said that if Ms Broad remained silent, Mr Martin would pay her some of the proceeds of the insurance policy.
	
	
	The factors relevant to assessment of the objective criminality of an offence of being an accessory after the fact to murder were considered in TT v R: [17] 
	


“13 In R v Quach, Simpson J said at [11] ‘I take the view that assistance in the disposal of a body after a murder takes a crime of this kind into the upper echelons of the offence against s 349.’ While the cases to which I have referred are cases prosecuted under s 349 of the Crimes Act, they have equal application to offences of accessory after the fact to manslaughter under s 350.

14 However, Fullerton J said in Kaminic v R [2014] NSWCCA 116 at [45]:

‘It does not follow that if the assistance an accessory renders is of a different or less direct kind (as well it might be in the case of a contract killing of the kind alleged here) that it necessarily constitutes offending of a lesser order of objective seriousness. Each case must be assessed on its own facts.’

15 In R v Johnson [2014] NSWSC 1254 I suggested that an assessment of the objective gravity of offences of this kind (in that case accessory after the crime of murder) involves a consideration of a number of factors which include, but are not limited to:

(1)The circumstances of the homicide itself.

(2)The extent of the knowledge in the accessory of those circumstances.

(3)The precise act, or acts, which constitutes the offence of being an accessory after the fact.

(4)The length of time over which the offender assisted the principal offender in escaping justice.

(5)The extent to which the acts of the offender successfully delayed, or thwarted, the investigation and prosecution of the principal offender.

(6)The motivation of the offender in committing the crime.

(7)The offender's conduct in being motivated by a sense of misguided loyalty or emotional attachment to the principal offender. This is a circumstance of particular significance in cases where a family member assists the principal offender.

(8)The disposal or destruction of a corpse. These cases generally fall at the upper end of the range of criminality for the offence.

16 In R v Dileski [2002] NSWCCA 345; (2002) 132 A Crim R 408, Hidden J said ‘in many cases of this kind the offender's conduct is the product of emotional attachment or dependence or a misguided sense of loyalty. No doubt, that accounts for most, if not all, of the cases in the judicial commission statistics which were disposed of otherwise than by full-time custodial sentences.’ In R v Quach Simpson J referred at [13] to the offender's state of ‘fear, loyalty and confusion” arising from his relationship with the principal.”


	
	This matter is far removed from cases such as TT, Kaminic and Quach. Applying the criteria identified in those earlier cases, I make the following observations and findings relevant to an assessment of the objective criminality of the offender:
	



	
	The circumstances of the homicide were particularly serious, involving a brutal assassination by samurai sword in the victim’s own home and in an attempt to obtain the very considerable proceeds of three insurance policies. The offence was planned, premeditated, involved an intention to kill, the use of a weapon and was carried out after an earlier unsuccessful attempt to murder the same victim.
	
	
	On the evidence before the Court, the offender did not know all of the circumstances but she was aware of the existence of one of the insurance policies, and stood to gain financially if her husband’s plan succeeded. She knew the co-offender had murdered his father using a samurai sword. The offence was at least partially motivated by financial gain. [18] 
	
	
	The acts of the offender involved persistently deceiving the police on behalf of her husband and failing to disclose critical information. It also involved an attempt to retrieve incriminating evidence from her husband’s work place. I do not accept her evidence that she went to her husband’s office “just to tell [his co-workers] to chuck his stuff out basically”. [19]  That account is inconsistent with the evidence of her communications with her husband surrounding her attendance at his office and with the contents of the letter that he was asking her to retrieve. Her evidence that she thought he was asking her to retrieve a psychiatric referral (the code used in the communications) lacks credibility.
	
	
	The offender persisted with her attempts to assist her husband over a period of around 10 months, from 20 June 2014 until mid-April 2015.
	
	
	Her conduct interfered with and thwarted the investigation to some degree but it was not ultimately successful and I am not persuaded that her behaviour was a particularly significant factor in the delay in charging Mr Martin. Obviously, had she come forward shortly after seeing her husband grinding the samurai sword (assuming that actually happened), it is likely that the police investigation would have culminated in the arrest of her husband much sooner.
	
	
	Ms Martin’s motivation was multi-faceted and complex. Her conversation with Ms Broad showed that she was concerned that informing on her husband would leave the children without a father. I accept that she was also in fear of her husband, due to their dysfunctional and at times violent relationship and the knowledge of the extreme violence that he had visited on his father. However, she was also, at least in part, motivated to benefit herself and her children financially. So much is clear from her request in a text message on 9 February 2015:
	


“Can you just get a house for the kids? 250,000; the rest is yours.”


	
	In the same text she said “(MONEY, I hate it!!!! Greed has ruined me; ruined us!)”
	
	
	This was a case where, to some degree, the offender’s conduct was motivated out of misguided loyalty. However, it is far removed from those cases spoken of by Hidden J in Dileski. This was not a parent protecting their child or a wife protecting her husband out of a sense of love, duty or loyalty. Ms Martin stood to benefit financially, at least vicariously through her children, if Mr Martin succeeded in his plans to get away with murder and make a successful claim on the insurance policy of which she was aware.
	
	
	Ms Martin played no part in disposal of the corpse (which was not, in this case, disposed of), or in destroying evidence or undertaking any of the other acts that are often associated with the worst cases of being an accessory after the fact to a homicide.
	



	
	It was submitted by the Crown that the fact that both attacks occurred in the home of the victim was “an aggravating feature to both the attempted murder and the accessory after the fact to murder”. I do not accept the second part of this submission. True it is that the murder itself was so aggravated, and that is relevant to an assessment of the seriousness of the accessory charge in the way explained in [27](1) above. However, none of the actions that constitute the accessory after offence was committed in the home of the victim and it would be an error to treat the matter as an aggravating feature under s 21A(2)(eb).
	
	
	In Kilic v The Queen, [20]  the High Court questioned the utility of categorising a case as falling within “the worst category” but observed that: 
	


“[a] sentencing judge is bound to consider where the facts of the particular offence and offender lie on the ‘spectrum’ that extends from the least serious instances of the offence to the worst category.” [21] 


	
	Taking into account all relevant matters, most of which are identified in [27] above, the offence of accessory after the fact to murder committed by Ms Martin falls towards the bottom of the wide spectrum of offences contemplated by s 349. However, it is a long way removed from those cases at the very bottom of that spectrum. The substantive offence was, as the Crown Prosecutor submitted, a heinous example of murder being a brutal assassination committed for financial reward following an earlier unsuccessful attempt. Further, the cover-up was persistent and ongoing and it was motivated, at least in part, by the hope that the family would reap the benefit of an insurance payout. On the other hand, the acts of assistance were towards the lower end of the kinds of acts often associated with offences of this kind and the other part of Ms Martin’s motivation was her reluctance to leave her children without their father and misconceived loyalty to a man who was her first love, and then her husband and father of two of her children.
	


IS A FULL TIME CUSTODIAL SENENCE REQUIRED?


	
	Section 5 of the Sentencing Act forbids the Court from imposing a gaol sentence unless there is no other appropriate alternative. Regrettably – from the perspective of Ms Martin, her family, her friends and her children – this is a case where the law provides no alternative punishment that would meet the purposes of punishment set out in section 3A. This observation applies in relation to both of the offences considered in isolation. But when the totality of the criminality between April 2014 and April 2015 is considered, the requirements of deterrence, denunciation, accountability and adequate punishment, call out for a full time custodial sentence of some length. On the other hand, the individual circumstances of this offender and her children require that the gaol sentence must be tempered by a significant degree of compassion.
	
	
	In reaching this conclusion, I have considered the powerful personal circumstances and the impact that a gaol sentence will have on Ms Martin’s children. But I have also kept in mind the sanctity with which the criminal law treats and protects human life. This is a case where there have been no victim’s impact statements provided. Mr Martin Snr died alone in a squalid flat in an industrial area of Murwillumbah. [22]  He did not have supporters in the courtroom. I do not know who grieves for him. However, in the eyes of the law his life is as sacred as the most popular, and well represented, victim of homicide. [23] 
	


DISCOUNTS FOR PLEAS OF GUILTY AND OFFER OF ASSISTANCE


	
	The offender entered pleas of guilty and offered to give evidence against her husband in accordance with an induced statement dated 1 September 2017. A question arises as to whether her sentence should be reduced as a result and, if so, to what extent. The parties agreed that different discounts for the plea of guilty were appropriate to the two offences because of the somewhat complicated history of the negotiations that led to the pleas. There is a guideline judgment in relation to the discounts that are appropriate when an offender pleads guilty. [24]  Section 23 of the Sentencing Act provides a list of factors that “must” be taken into account in deciding the extent of any discount for assistance to authorities. That list does not purport to be exhaustive.
	
	
	A letter written by the offender’s solicitor on 8 January 2016 suggested that the Crown might accept a plea of guilty to “either Conceal or Accessory After the Fact”. This suggestion was not taken up. On 3 August 2017, Ms Martin formally entered pleas of guilty to accessory after both the murder and the attempted murder (and another charge which has since been discontinued). The plea was not accepted in full discharge of the indictment and the separate trial application proceeded. Her trial, originally listed on 28 August 2017, was re-scheduled to commence at the conclusion of Mr Martin’s trial. The plea was then entered formally on 12 September 2017 at which time the plea was accepted. The Crown’s position concerning the accessory after charge changed once the offender acknowledged her guilt in relation to the attempted murder charge. It was submitted by the Crown that the letter of 8 January 2016 was really no more than an “invitation to treat”. Whether or not that is an accurate description of the correspondence, I am satisfied that the letter disclosed Ms Martin’s willingness at an early stage (and prior to her committal hearing) to plead guilty to the second offence for which she is to be sentenced. My conclusion is that her plea of guilty to the accessory after charge should be treated as an early one. [25] 
	
	
	As to the charge of attempted murder, there seems to have been no offer to plead guilty until after the commencement of her co-offender’s trial. Accordingly, the plea can only be described as one that came very late.
	
	
	The pleas saved a good deal of court time. The trial had an estimate of 4-5 weeks. Because of this, both pleas had a significant utilitarian value. In the circumstances, I propose to reduce the sentence by 25% for the plea of guilty to the accessory after charge and provide a discount of 15% for the plea to the attempted murder charge.
	
	
	The offer to give evidence against her husband also creates complications. The extent of discount that should be allowed is to be determined by reference, amongst other things, to the factors set out in s 23 of the Sentencing Act.
	
	
	The same letter from her solicitor sent to the prosecution on 8 January 2016 indicated that if the prosecution accepted Ms Martin’s offer to plead guilty “she would then be in a position to make an induced statement and appear as a Crown witness.” However, no such statement was prepared until 1 September 2017 (after the plea negotiations were finally resolved). I take a similar approach to that indicated in respect of her plea to the accessory after offence – the offer to assist and give evidence was a timely one. [26] 
	
	
	The Crown Prosecutor elected not to call Ms Martin as a witness in the trial. He formed the view that her evidence would lack credibility. Certainly, her evidence was contrary to a number of case theories ventilated in her husband’s trial. Further, her earlier interviews with police were littered with lies and any evidence she gave in the trial would have been subject to a tremendous attack on her credibility. The Crown’s assessment of her evidence reduced the “significance and usefulness” of the assistance. [27]  However, at least some of what she said led to the discovery (or understanding) of evidence that was used in the trial of her husband. [28] 
	
	
	The Crown also submitted that the assistance and the offender’s statement lacked “truthfulness, completeness and reliability”. [29]  I agree with the Crown’s submission that much of the offender’s statement appears to be exaggerated and dramatic. I would add self-serving. The extraordinary web of deceit in which Ms Martin was embroiled from April and June of 2014 until her pleas of guilty were entered in September 2017, along with the tissue of lies told to investigating police during that period, means that her reliability and truthfulness is, to put it as kindly as I can, questionable. In reality, it is difficult to know which parts of her account are true and which parts are not. However, parts of her evidence are clearly truthful and reliable. I am unable to determine the extent to which it is complete.
	
	
	There is no evidence that the offender’s offer to assist has resulted in any other benefit, or that she will suffer harsher custodial conditions as a result, or that she has suffered any injury. [30]  However, I accept that her fear of reprisal is real enough. Her parents have also expressed fears. The assistance relates to offences in which she was involved, either as a principal or as an accessory after. [31] 
	
	
	Taking into account all of these matters, as well as the “the nature and extent” of her assistance, [32]  I have concluded that there should be a further reduction in her sentence of 10%.
	
	
	Accordingly the sentence for the attempted murder will be reduced by 25% while the sentence for the accessory after murder will be reduced by 35%.
	
	
	In settling upon those discounts, I am conscious of the fact that the final sentencing outcome must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the criminality involved. [33]  While the discounts might be considered to be generous in the circumstances, given that offenders who enter their pleas at the first opportunity and provide assistance of the highest order rarely obtain discounts of more than 50-60%, I have taken into account the observations of Simpson J in R v Lenati. [34] 
	


THE OFFENDER’s case on sentence


	
	Ms Martin was 24 years old at the time of the offences and is 27 years old now. She has nor prior criminal history. She relies on a number of significant mitigating features. Where an offender seeks to establish matters in mitigation, the onus of proof is on the offender but the standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities. Counsel for Ms Martin mounted a powerful subjective case based on a large volume of evidence with a view to establishing a number of mitigating features. It is not possible to detail all of that evidence in the course of these remarks but I have considered it all closely.
	


Ms Martin’s evidence


	
	The offender gave evidence in which she swore to the truthfulness of her induced statement. She gave evidence about her actions and motives in the course of the offences. She expressed her fears and explained the difficulties faced by her children and her family should she be sent to gaol. It appeared that she had not yet faced the reality of her predicament and the inevitable imposition of a lengthy custodial sentence.
	
	
	One of the problems in acting on Ms Martin’s evidence is the nature and extent of her dishonesty and deceitfulness in her dealings with the police. She deliberately misled the investigators for many months. An interview conducted on 28 November 2014 can properly be described as a pack of lies. After her husband was arrested she attended Tweed Heads Police Station on 15 March 2015 protesting his innocence. Another interview was recorded. Again, she told lies to those investigating a murder of which she had a good deal of knowledge. A lengthy recorded interview on 9 April 2015 (after her arrest) also contains many dishonest responses. Her induced statement contains many assertions that appear to be self-serving and self-justifying. It is difficult to distinguish fact from fiction.
	
	
	Ms Martin’s evidence in Court was hard to assess. Her reactions to questioning were unpredictable and intense. At times she cried, seemingly uncontrollably. At other times, she reared up and expressed outrage at the Crown Prosecutor’s cross-examination:
	


“Q. So what you had agreed to assist with was exposing, depriving those children of their father or stepfather.

A. I did not agree, but if that’s what you’re asking - you’re flogging a dead horse here. I’ve pled guilty. What more do you want from me?” [35] 

…

“Q. At the time, you knew yourself that you were exposing yourself to very serious offending?

A. Might I put it to you that if I didn’t, I might be the one that was six foot under. It was - it came about around the time of that Allison Baden-Clay case up in Queensland and I think it was seeing that on the news that had his - had the wheels turning in his head when they were.” [36] 

…

“…You're putting it to me like this was a, you know, we were like two evil Bonnie and Clyde. This was not the case. This is not the case.” [37] 


	
	An assessment of Ms Martin’s evidence is very difficult. The observations of Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ in Fox v Percy are important: [38] 
	


“Further, in recent years, judges have become more aware of scientific research that has cast doubt on the ability of judges (or anyone else) to tell truth from falsehood accurately on the basis of such appearances. Considerations such as these have encouraged judges, both at trial and on appeal, to limit their reliance on the appearances of witnesses and to reason to their conclusions, as far as possible, on the basis of contemporary materials, objectively established facts and the apparent logic of events.”


	
	Further, it is easy – but wrong – for a sentencing Judge to approach the evidence of an offender with cynicism and distaste but impossible to know how a person in Ms Martin’s situation will react and whether those reactions are genuine or feigned or exaggerated. Ms Martin has never been in trouble before and, I assume, has never given evidence and been subject to cross-examination. The courtroom is a foreign and bewildering place and the offender gave her evidence in circumstances where her future, and the future of her young children, lay in the balance. This adds layer upon layer to the complexity of the task of making a reasoned and accurate assessment of her evidence. I have approached the task of assessing her evidence and her demeanour with considerable caution.
	
	
	Even allowing for the difficulties in assessing a person’s demeanour and emotional responses in the witness box, I got no real sense that Ms Martin truly comprehended the enormity and gravity of what she and her ex-husband did. When asked about “the choices [she] made” from April 2014 and 2015 she said:
	


“Disgusted. I just wish I could go back, right, right back and just never, never have allowed Micheal to make contact. I wish I could go back to 2010 and do things so much differently.” [39] 


	
	While I accepted the sincerity of this part of her evidence, there appeared to be scant acknowledgement of the pain and suffering experienced by the deceased in the attempted murder or the moral delinquency that attended her involvement in the first offence and her active participation in covering up the killing of a human being. A report prepared by a well-qualified forensic psychologist referred to her “feelings of guilt, stress and depression”, [40]  but problems attenuating that report are such that it is difficult to come to a positive finding (even on balance) that Ms Martin has gained a full insight on the brutality and selfishness involved in her actions. I have considered the references of her parents, husband and friend and the things she said in the two conversations recorded by listening device. Having considered all of the evidence, I think she remains in a state of partial denial and self-justification.
	
	
	On the other hand, I am satisfied that the emotion she exhibited when giving evidence about her children and her new relationship was genuine. I accepted her evidence on those subjects.
	
	
	I also accepted that by the end of 2013, and throughout the period of the offending, her relationship with Mr Martin was dysfunctional and at times violent. Ms Martin acknowledged in her evidence and in her induced statement that the violence between the couple went both ways. For example, she described an incident in January or February 2014 when the couple fought after she discovered he was taking out an insurance policy on the deceased’s life. That culminated in the co-offender slapping her and calling her an “ungrateful bitch”. Her response was to break “out of his hold and punch him in the nose making it bleed”. [41]  She told him “you might be capable of sick shit, but I will never go down without a fight”. She referred to the fact that she was trained in martial arts.
	
	
	The offender’s account of some of the violence in the relationship also receives support in other evidence tendered on sentence. For example, when her ex-husband made an apparent suicide attempt in December 2013, investigating police in Queensland took out a “Protection Order” [42]  in which the offender was nominated as the “aggrieved” and her husband as the “respondent”. [43]  The narrative described an incident of mutual abuse after a Christmas party. It appears that Mr Martin, who was very drunk, started the fight. Ms Martin called him “a cunt” and threw his “home brew” on the floor. Mr Martin then threatened to commit suicide and tied a rope around his neck. The order was sought to prevent Ms Martin having “ongoing worry and stress” and because it was “unknown the extent the respondent may go to in possibly harming the aggrieved in the future”. A second protection order was taken out in February 2015 and described “emotional blackmail”, Mr Martin calling the offender a “selfish bitch” and other abusive and manipulative behaviour. The order also refers to things said by one of the children that support the evidence that her husband was violent towards her.
	
	
	There was more support of Ms Martin’s evidence of violence in the relationship in the evidence (written and oral) of her mother and father. Each described an occasion when one of the young children told them of violence. Mr Owen said that the child told him “daddy (Micheal) had thrown a glass through the window, threatened mummy with a knife and also said he was going to burn the house down.” [44]  Mrs Owen provided an affidavit that included an assertion that the same child told her “Micheal ‘got mummy with a knife’”. [45]  The evidence of what the child told his grandparents corroborates an incident referred to by Ms Martin in her induced statement. [46]  She described an occasion in early 2015 when an argument about what her husband had done escalated:
	


“He stormed off into the kitchen and he returned with a butcher knife. He had that raging look on his face … I dropped to the floor in the hallway. I was thinking ‘this is it.’ Then [the child] came running over from the room to me [and said] ‘No! No Daddy. NOOO!’”


	
	Mr Owen also described the state of the house in February 2015. He said there were windows smashed in, overflowing ashtrays, empty liquor bottles and a room “smelling of aged vomit”.
	
	
	There is reference to the abusive nature of the relationship in the two listening device recordings. At one stage Ms Broad said “Micheal never threatened me, but he threatened you.” [47]  In the conversation recorded in the Brisbane Watch House Ms Martin referred to her husband as “an abusive arsehole”. [48] 
	
	
	There is also evidence that Ms Martin withdrew from a number of friendships and became isolated in the course of her relationship with the co-offender. This evidence came from Ms Martin herself, from the psychologist (based on a history), from her parents and from a close friend (Jade Whitfield). [49]  The psychologist’s report described Ms Martin’s symptoms as being consistent with her suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. It is not completely clear whether Ms Martin in fact suffered from this disorder, and whether it arose out of the relationship with Mr Martin up until April 2014 or arose after, and because of, her involvement in, and knowledge, of the offences.
	
	
	Based on all of the evidence (including the induced statement, Ms Martin’s evidence, the evidence of her parents and friends, the protection orders taken out in Queensland, and the content of the psychologist’s report), I am satisfied that the relationship with Mr Martin was dysfunctional, and at times violent, and that Mr Martin was manipulative and himself suffered significant mental health issues that impacted on the offender.
	
	
	However, I am unable to determine (on balance) whether some of the more dramatic and extravagant aspects of Ms Martin’s account are true or not. For example, I cannot determine whether Mr Martin made an implied threat by showing her the severed head of a puppy or whether, after he was discovered grinding down the sword, Mr Martin held the blade to Ms Martin’s throat. I am unable to determine the truthfulness of the implication that the co-offender used a syringe to inject unhygienic items in to his father when he was in hospital recovering from the first attempt on his life. Parts of that version are difficult to accept. [50]  As to the allegation about the puppy, the conversation recorded with Ms Broad provides a different account and suggests that the contents of the statement are exaggerated. After part of the conversation that was indecipherable, Ms Broad asked “He killed your dog? Why?” Ms Martin replied:
	


“Because she went, she bit me, but he started to cut her head off and um, seriously I’m fine, this is the first time I’ve cried about it.” [51] 


	
	I cannot determine the truthfulness of Ms Martin’s assertion that Eddie Manning (the deceased’s housemate) said to Mr Martin at the hospital after the April attack “You owe me huge”, thus giving rise to the inference that Mr Manning was part of the plan to kill the deceased.
	
	
	These are just some examples of matters where I am simply unable to determine where the truth lies. As the High Court made clear in Olbrich v The Queen: [52] 
	


“Very often prosecuting authorities (and a sentencing judge) will have only the most limited and imperfect information about how it was that the accused person came to commit an offence for which he or she stands for sentence.” 

The psychologist’s report and conclusions arising from that report


	
	I have made passing reference to a psychologist’s report tendered on sentence. [53]  I have taken into account its contents but it is a document that I approach with circumspection. In parts it is very difficult to understand. For example, I do not know what the report means when the author says:
	


“She presents with levels of clinical phenomena that is often seen within clinical populations…” [54] 


	
	That perhaps impenetrable observation is made in a paragraph that sets out the results of certain testing known as a Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI). Initially the results of the PAI were considered to be invalid because of the way in which Ms Martin responded to the questioning. [55]  While the results of the second attempt “were considered valid”, the psychologist offered a number of caveats suggesting that Ms Martin “may exaggerate complaints” and “tended to endorse items that present an unfavourable impression of her or represent bizarre and unlikely symptoms”. [56]  The result was that the PAI threw up “significant elevations across several clinical scales giving rise to the possibility many possible diagnoses.” [57]  The psychologist said the results had to be “interpreted with caution” and noted the possibilities (amongst others) of “a cry for help”, a “major depressive episode”, “phobic behaviour”, “hyper vigilance” and submissiveness due to “fear of abandonment”. The author noted that the “possibility” of imminent incarceration may have caused the elevation in clinical symptoms but ultimately concluded that “she presents with symptoms suggestive of affective disorders and these likely impair her level of functioning”. [58] 
	
	
	I have not lost sight of the fact that a sentencing Judge faced with evidence of an offender’s mental condition “ought not to approach the task in an unduly technical or restrictive way”. [59]  Even so, the evidence in this case presents particular difficulties. In spite of the manifest problems with the report, and the distinct possibility of malingering on the part of the subject, I am satisfied that Ms Martin is suffering from some form of psychological distress, or is at least emotionally vulnerable and fragile.
	
	
	I am satisfied that her vulnerability, along with other particular features of her case (including separation from at least two and possibly all of her children), she will find her time in custody more onerous than most offenders.
	
	
	I am also satisfied, for much the same reason, that the extent to which general deterrence should guide the sentencing process is somewhat muted. Any reasonable observer would appreciate that Ms Martin is not a particularly suitable vehicle through whom to send a message of deterrence because of her psychological fragility and the fact that she has four children under ten years old, at least two of whom suffer from significant medical or neurological conditions, and one of whom is a baby less than one year old. Even so, the nature of these crimes is such that deterrence remains a matter of real significance.
	
	
	Neither the psychological evidence nor anything else leads to a conclusion that Ms Martin’s moral culpability is diminished to any significant extent.
	


Was Ms Martin acting under duress?


	
	It was submitted that Ms Martin was acting under duress and that this constitutes a mitigating feature of her offending. [60]  In considering the issue of duress I have taken into account the submissions made on the subject by counsel for Ms Martin [61]  and on the observations of Johnson J in Tiknius v R. [62]  The concept of “non-exculpatory duress” presents a much lower hurdle conceptually to that which applies when an offender attempts to avoid conviction. However, the onus of proof shifts to the offender on the balance of probabilities. That presents a problem when the offender’s account, in a number of respects, lacks credibility. I acknowledge the force of the offender’s submission that some of her conduct that ostensibly undermines the proposition that she acted under duress might be seen as being “fairly commonly seen from victims of abusive relationships”. [63]  Even though there was little evidence to support this contention, the criminal courts are commonly confronted with the enigma of a victim of domestic abuse who appears to remain compliant and to continue to exhibit fondness and love for their tormenter. [64]  Some reliance was placed on the observations of Adams J in R v Anderson but (as acknowledged by counsel) that was a very different case. [65] 
	
	
	I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Ms Martin was acting under duress when she agreed to participate in the attempted murder of her father-in-law or when she attempted to provide her husband with a false alibi to cover his movements. I am unable to determine the extent to which her account of the events leading up to the 7 April 2015, including what she says happened on the drive home from Murwillumbah on 6 April 2014, is true. [66]  As I have already said, I believe her motivation was complex and included a misguided sense of loyalty, a response to emotional blackmail, and greed.
	
	
	I am also unable to accept (on balance) that Ms Martin acted under duress in covering up her husband’s role in the murder. I accept that the violence she alleges in early 2015 receives some support from the things said by her son to each of her parents. However, by that time she had successfully assisted her husband to avoid detection for six months.
	
	
	In reaching these conclusions, I have taken into account the fact that on a number of occasions (according to her statement) she responded to abusive encounters with violence of her own. I have already referred to the occasion when she punched him in the nose using her martial arts training. When threatened in around June 2014 she told her husband: [67] 
	


“I hate you” … “I’m not scared of what I hate” … “Go on, try to touch me! I’ll be ready!” and “You threaten my family again and you will be the one who ends up worse off”.


	
	I have also taken into account the evidence that Ms Martin went on a holiday to Fiji with her husband in September 2014 (a matter that was omitted from her detailed induced statement). [68]  I have also considered the tone and content of a recorded telephone conversation on 4 February 2015. [69]  This call, in which Ms Martin speaks fondly to her then husband, occurred after the incident in which Ms Martin alleges Mr Martin showed her the severed head of a puppy by way of an implied threat. Even allowing for the unpredictable ways in which a victim of a violent relationship may react, the evidence is not consistent with an assertion that the offender acted as a result of duress.
	
	
	Further, I am satisfied that Ms Martin was motivated more by the desire to protect her children from losing their father, from the possibility of obtaining some financial benefit, and from a misguided sense of loyalty to a man she did not want to lose. She said such things in both of the conversations recorded by listening device. [70]  As to the presence of a financial motive, Ms Martin offered Ms Broad money for her silence (or suggested that her husband would pay her part of the insurance money) and asked for a $250,000 house for her children in the text message of 9 February 2015. In that same text she said “Greed has ruined me; ruined us!” [71] 
	
	
	I have taken into account the abusive nature of the relationship, and the fragility of Ms Martin’s emotional state, in assessing her actions in relation to these two offences. More probably than not, Ms Martin felt lost and helpless as the situation developed and escalated from February 2014 until both her husband and she were arrested. I am sure that she had mixed motives and loyalties. However, she could at any time have sought the assistance of the police. [72]  Instead, she witnessed her husband’s signature on an insurance claim, offered a witness money on his behalf, and continued to mislead police even after her husband was taken into custody. In all of the circumstances I do not accept that she has established duress as a mitigating feature.
	


The impact of the sentencing on the offender’s family and children


	
	Binding authority prohibits a sentencing Judge from taking into account the impact of a sentence on third parties unless the case is wholly exceptional. [73]  I have considered that principle but am satisfied that the present case comfortably represents an exception to the general rule. The hardship to the offender’s family in the present case is properly categorised as “extreme hardship”. The case is wholly exceptional and extraordinary.
	
	
	Ms Martin has four children aged between 9 months and 7 years. Their names cannot be published and I will refer to them by letters.
	
	
	The oldest child (“O”) was the issue of a relationship that preceded the marriage between the offender and Mr Martin. O lives with his father and has some contact with his maternal grandparents. It is agreed between the parties that the bail conditions made it difficult for the offender to have contact with him since her arrest. I understand there has been no contact as a result. That has made Ms Martin’s remand period particularly onerous and that is a matter that I take into account in assessing an appropriate sentence.
	
	
	The second and third children are the product of Ms Martin’s marriage to the co-offender. M (a son) is 5 years old and R (a daughter) is 4. M has a range of issues that are described in two medical reports. [74]  He was born prematurely and suffered several life threatening events in his first six months. He has a “range of sensory issues”, “major problems managing change” and is significantly delayed developmentally. He requires assistance with all everyday aspects of his life. A report dated 17 October 2017 diagnosed M with “pervasive development delay” and “autistic disorder”. An attempt for him to commence “prep” school failed. His behavioural issues are serious and troubling. Dr Weslyn provided the following opinion:
	


“[M] would definitely benefit from having his mother as his primary carer. I also believe that his mother going to prison would be detrimental and would significantly affect his health and wellbeing negatively.”


	
	Mr Owen (the offender’s father) gave moving evidence of the impact on the children of their mother’s incarceration and in particular the impact on M: [75] 
	


“A. Actually it’ll absolutely devastate the children. As stated in the reference letters and what-not, the children were all born extremely prematurely, lucky to have survived the birthing process. Months after each birth, each child has to spend those months in hospital building up immunities, going through various health issues before they were allowed to go home. The youngest one currently is still on oxygen at the moment. They’ve got a variety of health issues ranging from autism spectrum, brain, lung, heart problems with the current infant. Yeah, I know when Candace was originally arrested the - M, the second oldest child, he would wake screaming in the night, basically sort of night terrors, and every time Candace basically leaves the room it’s like, ‘Is Mummy coming back?’ and for M, just M alone, … he will not cope.”


	
	R, who is just 4 years old, will also miss her mother and will suffer from her mother’s incarceration. She will be, as described by the offender’s new husband, “orphaned”.
	
	
	The youngest child is J. He is a nine-month-old baby born in January this year. He was also born prematurely and has a variety of serious medical issues detailed in the reports of his treating doctors and a social worker. [76]  He has had several admissions to hospital. In July he was treated for “enteroviros meningitis” and “adenovirus bronchitis”. He was only able to be released from hospital “because his mother Candace is trained in managing his various high needs at home including the NG tube, home oxygen and monitoring for seizures”. The social worker expresses the opinion that it is in the baby’s best interest that “leniency [should be] shown towards Candace” because “he requires the support and love of a parent, and Candace is the best person to care and nurture this little boy”. J’s father provided a similar opinion. [77] 
	
	
	In these circumstances the case must be dealt with in a way that might otherwise be seen as involving an undue amount of leniency given the seriousness of the offending and the sanctity that the law places on human life. Notwithstanding the force and currency of the remarks made by Gleeson CJ in Edwards, a number of subsequent cases have explained the different approach where the well being of children of tender years is at stake. In HJ v R, Garling J (Hoeben CJ at CL and Hulme J agreeing) summarised some of these cases in the following important passage: [78] 
	


“67 This Court has held that the fact that a person to be sentenced is the mother of young baby is a relevant factor to take into account: see R v Togias [2001] NSWCCA 522; (2001) 127 A Crim R 23. In that case, the applicant was standing for sentence about two months after her baby was born. That fact was well known to the sentencing Judge who had adjourned the proceedings on sentence to await the birth of the applicant's child. At [5] Spigelman CJ said with respect to an alleged failure by the sentencing Judge to deal with the matter appropriately because the sentencing Judge had imposed an order suspending the sentence of imprisonment, this:

‘Furthermore, the order suspending the sentence could not be justified on the basis that the respondent would be separated from her child for an unknown period. His Honour could, and should, have deferred sentencing until the respondent had been assessed, so that the Court knew whether or not there would be any separation.’

68 The Chief Justice went on to say, at [7]:

‘In an appropriate case, the inability of prison authorities to provide for detention in a humane manner will justify a court refusing to impose a custodial sentence. That was not shown to be the case here. His Honour was correct to conclude that the evidence from the Department of Corrective Services revealed a process that involved unacceptable delays so that the probable separation of mother and baby could be regarded as inhumane. However, his Honour failed to have regard to the fact that, by deferring by the sentencing task, he may have been able to ensure that, with the cooperation of authorities and subject to a positive assessment, there would be no such separation.’

69 It was noted in Togias, where the applicant was an adult, that the provisions of s 16A(2)(p) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) required a court to have regard to, where relevant, ‘the probable effect that any sentence or order under consideration would have on any of the person's family or dependants’.

70 It was noted that the authorities provided that exceptional circumstances needed to exist before that provision could be considered: R v Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 510 at 516-517; R v Ceissman (2001) 119 A Crim R 535 at 540-541 [36].

71 As the judgment of Spigelman CJ in Togias demonstrates, Articles 3.1, 9.1 and 9.4 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989, may all have relevance. However, I note in this case no party drew attention to these provisions, or sought to rely upon them for the purpose of any submissions. Accordingly, in the absence of full argument, it is inappropriate for this Court to deal with the relevance of this Convention.

72 At [67] of Togias, Grove J (with whom Spigelman CJ agreed) with respect to whether or not the sentencing Judge ought to have adjourned the proceedings to obtain further information with respect to the applicant and her child, said this:

‘Adjournment sine die is not contemplated but a limited delay to obtain useful information. What was required was firm evidence of what conditions would pertain in relation to this respondent and her child in the event that an order committing her to prison were to be made. The evidence tendered was limited to generalities. No attempt was made to obtain focussed information. It is possible that a response in particular terms may not be forthcoming from Corrective Services, but such situation would need to be take into account if it arose. His Honour elected to proceed without knowing what the situation was in this regard.’

73 In SLR this Court held in circumstances where the applicant was pregnant at the time of sentencing, that the fact that the Juvenile Justice Centre, where the applicant was then detained, would not be able to accommodate the applicant's newborn child immediately following its birth, and that no other juvenile facilities in NSW were available which could so accommodate them, was a relevant factor for the sentencing Judge to take into account.

74 Interestingly, in light of the material agreed in this Court about appropriate arrangements for mothers and young babies in custody, to which no attention was paid in the Court below, the Crown in SLR submitted that

‘... the applicant should not be separated from her newborn baby because an order directing her to serve her sentence in a detention centre in advertently deprived her of a facility which is available to adult female prisoners namely, to keep their babies with them up until the age of 5 years.’

75 In SLR, in circumstances where the sentencing Judge had not specifically adverted to the inability of the applicant to have her child with her after birth, this Court intervened to alter the sentence imposed upon the offender. The effect of the alteration was to ensure that after the birth of the offender's child, she was transferred to an adult prison where facilities were available to keep her child and where an application could be made for leave under the then current s 29(2)(c) of the Correctional Centres Act 1952. That provision now exists, in similar terms, in s 26 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999.


	
	No submission was made as to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child but I have taken its principles into account in determining the appropriate sentencing response to this case in which the offending calls for condign punishment but the circumstances of four children is dire as a result of their parents’ criminal conduct. The only comfort is that each of the children will be cared for by a loving parent, or step-parent or grand-parents during the period of the offender’s incarceration.
	


The Mothers and Children Program


	
	Having read the material to be relied on by the offender, I asked my staff to make contact with the officers in charge of a programme within Department of Justice, Corrective Services known as the “Mothers and Children Program”. [79]  An 8-page information sheet was provided by the co-ordinator of that programme. Copies of this document were provided to the parties. [80]  In turn, it was tendered in evidence. [81]  The Mothers and Children Program provides custodial accommodation for offenders who are the mothers of young children. The programme can accommodate children of less than school age. This would apply to M, R and J. However, it is not known whether the programme could accommodate any or all of the children. Nor is it known whether the programme would be able to accommodate the medical needs of J or be able to cope with the behavioural issues presented by M.
	
	
	On the information before me, I must accept the submission of Mr Healy that the programme seems to involve “a post-incarceration assessment process”. [82]  That means that I must sentence Ms Martin on the basis of incomplete information. I do not know whether the offender, or M, R or J will be able to be accommodated by the Mothers and Children Program. In either case, the appropriate course in sentencing Ms Martin is to impose the shortest possible non-parole period.
	
	
	I note that the information provided suggests that the assessment process can take “less than one week”. [83]  However, the same part of the document suggests that this applies to the assessment of “an offender accused or convicted of a non-violent offence”. For the purpose of those considering any application by Ms Martin for admission to the programme, I indicate there is no evidence that Ms Martin perpetrated any violence in the course of either offence. While the offences for which she is to be sentenced are, on their face, extremely serious offences of violence, I repeat that Ms Martin’s role did not involve committing any act of violence.
	
	
	I propose to make recommendations and directions to facilitate the possible expedition of the process by which Ms Martin might be admitted to the Mothers and Children Program. However, I am not sanguine as to her prospects and proceed on the basis that there is likely to be a substantial period of separation from the children.
	


A new start and positive signs for the future


	
	The lack of prior convictions and the references tendered in her case satisfies me that Ms Martin was a person of prior good character. [84] 
	
	
	Ms Martin is now in a relationship with J’s father. They are married and their relationship appears to be a positive one. J’s father provided a reference and both of Ms Martin’s parents suggested the new relationship has resulted in positive changes in the offender. [85] 
	
	
	Based on this material, the dissolution of the dysfunctional relationship with the co-offender, the incentive to reform provided by her children, the absence of any prior criminal history and the opinion of the psychologist, I have concluded that Ms Martin has good prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to re-offend. [86]  I have reached that conclusion in spite of the lack of insight that Ms Martin appears to have into the gravity of the offending, the difficulties associated with her evidence, and her interaction with the psychologist. I took those matters into account, but am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the relevant mitigating features are established.
	


STRUCTURING THE SENTENCE: accumulation, aggregate sentencing and special circumsances


	
	It would be open to impose a single aggregate sentence under s 53A of the Sentencing Act. However, it is more appropriate in this case to impose separate sentences. This is because there are only two sentences to be imposed, different discounts apply to each, and one offence involves a standard non-parole period while the other does not. Those factors do not mean that an aggregate sentence cannot be imposed but they militate against it. For the sake of transparency, it is preferable in this case to impose separate sentences.
	
	
	There must be some accumulation of the two sentences. Ordinarily, there would be far more substantial accumulation than I propose to order. The reason for the modest degree of accumulation is my intention to impose the shortest possible non-parole period. I propose to impose a fixed term in relation to the second offence (the accessory after) and to commence that sentence on 26 October 2017. That date is agreed between the parties and takes into account 8 days that the offender spent in custody prior to being released on bail. For the purpose of s 45 of the Sentencing Act, the reasons that I decline to set a non-parole period concern the structure of the total sentence and because the sentence for the attempted murder will commence eighteen months later and will subsume the balance of that sentence.
	
	
	In relation to the attempted murder I find special circumstances pursuant to s 44 of the Sentencing Act and will make a substantial reduction in the non-parole period that would otherwise apply as a result of the operation of that section. The special circumstances are constituted by the accumulation of the sentence on the sentence for the accessory after offence and the exceptional factual circumstances concerning the offender’s children. As I have said on more than one occasion, the adjustment to the non-parole period will be a seemingly extreme one. It is calculated to achieve the lowest possible non-parole period in order to minimise (1) any period of separation between the offender and her children (especially those with special needs) or (2), if she is accepted into the Mothers and Children Program, the period that the children are held in custody with their mother.
	
	
	At the same time, both the modest degree of accumulation and the substantial downward adjustment of the non-parole period ought not to result in a sentence that is unreasonably disproportionate to the grave criminality involved in these offences. The total sentence (that is the non-parole period and balance of term) should reflect the seriousness of the offence and serve the objectives of punishment that dictate that a significant gaol sentence must be imposed on somebody who has committed offences as objectively grave as those with which the Court is presently dealing.
	


THE LENGTH OF THE SENTENCE: CONSISTENCY OF PUNISHMENT, COMPARATIVE SENTENCes AND INDIVIDUAL JUSTICE


	
	A fair system of criminal justice requires that there be reasonable consistency in the punishment imposed on offenders in different cases with similar characteristics. [87]  At the same time, sentencing requires individualised justice. If justice is not individual “it is nothing”. [88] 
	
	
	The Crown took me to the summary of cases on accessory after the fact to murder that are attached to my judgment in R v Johnson. [89]  In settling on the appropriate sentence for that charge, I have considered the outcomes in other cases. But none of the cases are the same as this one and none include the kind of personal and family circumstances that attend the present case.
	
	
	As to the attempted murder, neither party was able to find a case with similar features. That is: a case where the objective facts of the attempted murder were at the extreme end of the spectrum but the offender’s role was limited to providing a false alibi and other assistance. I have considered the statistics maintained by the Judicial Commission albeit with the caution that must attend such a consideration. All 34 cases in the database resulted in full-time custodial sentences and only one of those involved a non-parole period of less that 4½ years. That was a non-parole period of 2 years. The overwhelming number of cases (75%) resulted in total sentences of 10 years or more for the principal offence. I have also considered the judgments of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Williams v R [90]  and Shine v R. [91]  Williams resulted in a sentence of 10 years with a non-parole period of 7 years, but that was after a 45% discount for a plea of guilty and assistance. That sentence was not disturbed on appeal. Shine was sentenced to 9 years with a non-parole period of 5 years after a successful appeal. He received a 25% discount for his plea and suffered from a significant mental illness that had a marked impact on the appropriate sentence. There was psychiatric evidence that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong and this reduced his moral culpability. [92] 
	
	
	Having considered those cases and the statistics, I must apply the principle of individual justice and settle on a sentence that appears to be just by synthesising the many relevant factors which pull, as often they do, in different directions.
	


SENTENCING


	
	In relation to the offence of accessory after the fact to murder, I would commence with a starting point of 5 years. Applying a discount of 35% for the plea of guilty and offer of assistance, the resulting sentence will be one of 3 years and three months. I decline to set a non-parole period for the reasons explained above.
	
	
	In relation to the offence of attempted murder, the starting point will be 10 years. Applying the discount of 25%, the result is a total sentence of 7½ years. That sentence will commence 18 months after the sentence imposed for the accessory after offence. Giving effect to the finding of special circumstance, and my stated intention to impose as short a non-parole period as I can in the proper exercise of discretion, there will be a non-parole period of 2½ years.
	
	
	The total effective sentence will therefore be one of 9 years with a total effective non-parole period of 4 years.
	
	
	Candace Martin, you are convicted of both offences:
	



	
	For the offence of being an accessory after the fact to the murder of Michael Anthony Martin, you a sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of three years and three months commencing on 26 October 2017 and expiring on 25 January 2021.
	
	
	For the offence of attempted murder of Michael Anthony Martin, you are sentenced to a non-parole period of 2½ years commencing on 26 April 2019 and expiring on 25 October 2021. There will be a balance of term of 5 years commencing on 26 October 2021 and expiring on 25 October 2026.
	
	
	You will be eligible for release on parole at the conclusion of the non-parole period for the attempted murder.
	
	
	By section 25C of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW), I am required to warn you that the provisions of that Act apply to the offence of attempted murder and I direct your legal representatives to explain to you the possible impact of that Act at the conclusion of the sentence and non-parole period.
	
	
	I recommend that any application for inclusion in the Mothers and Children Program be assessed as quickly as possible.
	
	
	I direct my Associate to provide to the co-ordinator of the Mothers and Children Program the following documents:
	



	
	A copy of this judgment.
	
	
	A copy of the transcript of these proceedings.
	
	
	A copy of all exhibits tendered in the proceedings drawing particular attention to exhibits A (Tab 1), B, E, 1, 2 and 3.

Introduction


	
	These are proceedings for defamation. On 15 September 2017 I delivered judgment in these proceedings (Chow v Un [2017] NSWDC 254) and made the following orders:
	



	
	Judgment for the first plaintiff for $95,000.
	
	
	Judgment for the second plaintiff for $65,000.
	
	
	Costs reserved, with liberty to apply concerning interest and costs.
	
	
	Exhibits retained for 28 days.
	



	
	In accordance with order (3), the plaintiffs now seek costs and interest. On 26 October 2017, appearing ex parte in the Defamation List, Mr Rasmussen informed the court that the legal representatives for the defendant has ceased acting on or about 6 October 2017. He sought orders for the relisting of the costs and interest issue. The following orders were made on 26 October 2017:
	



	
	The plaintiffs’ application for interest and indemnity costs is stood over for argument to Thursday 2 November 2017 at 9:00am in Court 13D, John Maddison Tower, 86 Goulburn Street, Sydney before Gibson DCJ.
	
	
	The plaintiffs are to notify the defendant by email and by registered post by 5:00pm today that if the defendant does not attend court to argue his case orders will be made in his absence.
	
	
	A copy of these orders will also be provided by the Court to the parties in the Traditional Chinese language.
	



	
	Mr Rasmussen also drew our attention to the fact that the defendant has limited ability to read English. My associate has translated my orders into Chinese and provided the following translation to the parties:
	



	
	原告人對有關利息和以彌償基準計算的訟費的申請押後到2017年11月2日上午9時聆訊。地點為法庭13D，John Maddison Tower，86 Goulburn Street，悉尼。
	
	
	原告人應當在今天下午五點前通過電子郵件及以掛號郵遞方式通知被告人今天法庭的命令，並告知被告人如他在2017年11月2日上午9時未能出席，法庭將在他缺席的情況下作出判決。
	
	
	法院將把這些法庭命令翻譯成繁體中文及提供給原告人及被告人。
	



	
	The defendant came to court today without an interpreter. He acknowledged receipt of the orders and the plaintiffs’ submissions, but told me that it was the court’s obligation to provide him with an interpreter. That is not the case, as the defendant well knows from prior attendances in this court. However, my associate translated his addresses to the court and Mr Rasmussen’s replies and the hearing proceeded on that basis.
	


The plaintiffs’ application for costs


	
	The plaintiffs seek an order that all costs (including reserved costs should be paid on an indemnity basis, either for the whole of the proceedings or from the date of a Calderbank offer (17 April 2017).
	
	
	The plaintiffs are entitled to their ordered costs on the basis that costs follow the event: r 42.1 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (“UCPR”). The plaintiffs are also entitled to claim costs on an indemnity basis by reason of s 40 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) which provides:
	


“40 Costs in defamation proceedings

(1) In awarding costs in defamation proceedings, the court may have regard to:

(a) the way in which the parties to the proceedings conducted their cases (including any misuse of a party's superior financial position to hinder the early resolution of the proceedings), and

(b) any other matters that the court considers relevant.

(2) Without limiting subsection (1), a court must (unless the interests of justice require otherwise):

(a) if defamation proceedings are successfully brought by a plaintiff and costs in the proceedings are to be awarded to the plaintiff--order costs of and incidental to the proceedings to be assessed on an indemnity basis if the court is satisfied that the defendant unreasonably failed to make a settlement offer or agree to a settlement offer proposed by the plaintiff, or

(b) if defamation proceedings are unsuccessfully brought by a plaintiff and costs in the proceedings are to be awarded to the defendant--order costs of and incidental to the proceedings to be assessed on an indemnity basis if the court is satisfied that the plaintiff unreasonably failed to accept a settlement offer made by the defendant.

(3) In this section: “settlement offer” means any offer to settle the proceedings made before the proceedings are determined, and includes an offer to make amends (whether made before or after the proceedings are commenced), that was a reasonable offer at the time it was made.”


	
	The matter complained of was published on 29 December 2013. A Concerns Notice was sent on 21 January 2014. This was followed by a series of letters proposing settlement as follows:
	



	
	21 January 2014 (soon after publication but prior to commencement of proceedings - Apology and payment of reasonable legal costs.
	
	
	27 April 2017 - (Calderbank Letters) Discontinuance, apology, payment of reasonable legal costs
	
	
	12 May 2017 - (open offer) Discontinuance, apology, payment of reasonable legal costs.
	
	
	15 May 2017 - (During the trial and in open Court) Apology;
	
	
	5 October 2017 - Letter to the defendant’s solicitors re costs and interest;
	
	
	12 October 2017 - Letter to the defendant re costs and interest.
	



	
	The defendant has never made any offer, and scoffed at the request for apology made during the hearing, as well as in the application before me today. He stated that the plaintiffs were criminals, that their witnesses were lying about his having published anything, and that the Goon Yee Tong organisation had been taken over by communists from China. He also referred to the Constitution of the Goon Yee Tong, which states that disputes should be resolved by mediation rather than court proceedings. However, mediation has already been attempted with the defendant, not only by the plaintiffs but also in this court, without any success.
	
	
	For the duration of the time that these proceedings have been before the court, the court has made every effort to assist the defendant and to promote non-litigious resolution in accordance with s 3 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW). The court’s free mediation system was offered to both parties (as well as assistance with foreign language problems to the defendant) who was also referred for pro bono assistance. This has included having the orders I made on 26 October 2017 (see above) translated into traditional Chinese now that he is self-represented, so that he is aware of the nature of the application before the court today.
	
	
	The solicitors and counsel who appeared from him at interlocutory proceedings and at the hearing have all worked tirelessly to assist him.
	
	
	Despite this assistance from the court and from the legal profession, the defendant has remained intransigent throughout and, as is set out in the judgment, was angrily dismissive of Mr Rasmussen’s requests to him in court to apologise in lieu of continuing the case. He was, if anything, even angrier and upset in the proceedings before me this morning.
	
	
	The plaintiffs have at all times tried to settle the proceedings on the basis of a public apology and reasonable legal costs. The provisions of s 40(3) of the Act are satisfied. Accordingly the defendant must pay the plaintiffs’ costs of the proceedings on an indemnity basis, including reserved costs.
	


Interest


	
	The Plaintiffs are entitled to interest from the date of publication (29 December 2013) to the date of Judgment (15 September 2017):
	
	
	In Davis v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2008] NSWSC 946 at [20], McClellan CJ at CL stated:
	


“[20] The proceedings in this case were not unduly delayed. Because I am satisfied that the majority of the damage was occasioned at or about the time of publication, adequate allowance can be made for continuing damage and for the component of aggravation occasioned by the defendant’s conduct at trial by adjusting the conventional rate by a modest amount. Although a rate of 3.5% would not be inappropriate I have determined that interest should be awarded at 3% per annum.”


	
	Trial judges generally award 3 – 3.5% interest on damages in defamation awards, although there have been isolated cases where as much as 4% was awarded (Habib v Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd (No 4) [2012] NSWDC 12 at [432]).
	
	
	The plaintiffs seek interest at 3% as follows:
	



	
	The total interest for the first plaintiff from the date of publication (29 December 2013) to the date of judgment (15 September 2017) is therefore $10,587.95.
	
	
	The total interest for the second plaintiff from the date of publication (29 December 2013) to the date of judgment (15 September 2017) is therefore $7,244.38
	



	
	The revised totals for judgment are therefore the sums set out in the orders below.
	


Orders


	
	The orders I make by way of variation of the judgment orders of 15 September 2017 (which is the date for these orders to be entered) are as follows:
	


As between the first plaintiff and the defendant:


	
	Pre-judgment interest is to apply at the rate of 3% from 29 December 2013 to 15 September 2017 in the amount of $10,587.95.
	
	
	Judgment for the first plaintiff in the sum of $105,587.95.
	
	
	Judgment in the amount referred to in order (2) be as and from 15 September 2017.
	
	
	The defendant to pay the first plaintiff’s legal costs and disbursements of the entire proceedings upon the indemnity basis.
	


As between the second plaintiff and the defendant:


	
	Pre-judgment interest is to apply at the rate of 3% from 29 December 2013 to 15 September 2017 in the amount of $7,244.38.
	
	
	Judgment for the first plaintiff in the sum of $72,244.38.
	
	
	Judgment in the amount referred to in order (2) be as and from 15 September 2017.
	
	
	The defendant to pay the second plaintiff’s legal costs and disbursements of the entire proceedings upon the indemnity basis.

		02 November 2017",2017-11-01 00:00:00,NSW District Court
6320404,Foong v Ghaly; Foong v McLellan [2017] NSWDC 303,"Judgment


	
	The plaintiff brings proceedings for damages arising out of two motor vehicle accidents occurring on 2 March and 2 September 2011 for physical and psychiatric injuries. The plaintiff, who acts for herself, seeks damages in the sum of $20,665,550 for both cases “all type [sic] of costs courts [sic] legal costs (past and future)” (plaintiff’s submissions, paragraph 1).
	
	
	Breach of duty in relation to each of the accidents is admitted and a claim of contributory negligence was abandoned during the hearing.
	
	
	The plaintiff fails to reach the threshold for non-economic loss (although this has not prevented her from claiming $3 million for what she described in her submissions as “brain injury”).
	
	
	The issues for determination are the plaintiff’s entitlements to past and future economic loss, home care and out-of-pocket expenses.
	
	
	The basis of the economic loss claim is, as plaintiff sets out in paragraph 4 of her submissions, that she has been self-employed for over 20 years. She describes herself as “a hard working person” with transferable skills if the motor accidents had not happened to her. She says that she could work as a self-employed general sales manager, although acknowledging that she had lost her real estate licence in the circumstances set out below. She also claims for loss of a chance in relation to an investment property she was forced to sell.
	
	
	The basis of the home care claim is the plaintiff’s asserted inability to perform many household tasks.
	
	
	The plaintiff also makes a claim for a wide range of out of pocket expenses and legal expenses in relation to work performed by her former solicitor.
	


The plaintiff’s background


	
	The plaintiff, who is currently 58 years old, was born in Vietnam and as a result of the war in that country went to live in New Zealand in 1979 with her family. She came to Australia in 1996. She learnt English at school, although her first language is Cantonese; she also speaks and reads Mandarin and Vietnamese.
	
	
	She had a normal childhood and education in New Zealand. She obtained work in sales and completed a strata management licence, following which she obtained a franchising business online through the Williams Angliss Institute through a Melbourne technical college. She obtained employment at Century 21 Real Estate Agency. Her real estate work history goes back to approximately 1995 when she was working for Harcourts Real Estate Wellington. The plaintiff married in 1987 and gave birth to three children in the course of the marriage, all of whom are now adults.
	
	
	In about 2009, after commencing work for Century 21, the plaintiff was investigated with respect to trust account discrepancies arising from the sale of a property earlier that year. At this stage the plaintiff was already in financial difficulty, having been made bankrupt apparently as a result of unrelated financial activities involving her husband.
	
	
	On 11 May 2010 the plaintiff fell down a flight of stairs at a hotel while attending a work function. This caused her to consult her general practitioner later that same day and to complain of significant disabilities in relation to her left shoulder. She consulted Dr Matthew Sherlock, an orthopaedic surgeon, who considered she had significant pathology to the injured shoulder which required surgery in that she suffered from complete tears of the supraspinatus and subscapularis with medial biceps instability. There were also problems with the non-injured shoulder of a degenerative nature. She did not have that surgery and continued to work full time.
	


The first accident


	
	The plaintiff suffered her first motor vehicle accident on 2 March 2011. The defendant’s vehicle turned right across the path of the plaintiff’s vehicle at an intersection in the city. There was an impact of some significance. The plaintiff’s son, who was also in the vehicle, was injured.
	
	
	The plaintiff had been on her way to the Local Court to meet her solicitor in relation to some of her ongoing legal proceedings, and did not stop except to exchange particulars. When she arrived at court, her solicitor told her to return to the scene of the accident:
	


“The accident - now I'm talking about the accident. In 2011, 2 March, around 8.45, I was on the way to Local Court to claim for my commission because I work very hard for that property and I deserve my commission and I was taking my son on the way to UTS as well. And I go straight on the second lane and the other driver on the other side, westerly side, mine is on the easterly side on the second lane. He turn into right and hit on my right-hand side, driver's side. He according to my - the DVD, actually the arrow was red. Once it turned green never turned - never ever - once it green and then red, cannot turn any more. He has to wait for another route, but he didn't wait. He just turn on the red into me.

And then after the accident, he immediately flee away and then let me alone to slowly - I think it makes sense that I slowly move my car to the left-hand side because I don't want to block any people. It's on the peak time at the time. And I - and then because at the same time my solicitor waiting for me in Local Court, I didn't think - I couldn't think of anything because at that time I, I got injured my head. I lost a few minutes memory. I couldn't think and then my left - my right shoulder hit my - hit the door and then bouncing to my - hit my head as well and then bouncing to hit my the left side on the chair so I - on that time, I really didn't care about my health much because I was thinking of the - my solicitor just waiting for me and I went to the Local Court. I told him that I just had accident, I cannot think and he said, ""You just go back. Whatever you want to do, you need to do it, go back to do it.""

So I went - on the way back the police call me because I leave a note to say that my car cannot drive, just have accident, so he call me and I said, ""Yes, I'm on the way back."" And then after that I - on the same day I go to the - the - my GP in Chatswood with my son to report the accident because I - I was - we were very unwell at that time and I report the accident. And I still wanted to work. I carry on to work but in the end my - I couldn't copy with any more so I stop around beginning of June, beginning of June and then I - that's I, I don't want to stop there and then sit in the house do nothing because I'm not that type of person, so I say, I better do something.” (T 31)


	
	The plaintiff went later that day to her general practitioner (see Exhibit 2 page 18) which records the entry:
	


“No head injury, no LOC [loss of consciousness], wants all to be recorded.”


	
	The plaintiff was cross-examined about this information being recorded:
	


“Q. Page 18. You will see down the bottom, ""2 March 2011"". Do you see that?

A. (No verbal reply)

HER HONOUR

Q. And you saw VP, that's what it says, Dr Putica, did you say?

A. Putica.

FITZSIMMONS

Q. See down the bottom, Mrs Foong, right at the last entry.

A. By--

Q. ""2 March 2011"". Do you see that?

A. Yes.

Q. See that? You can see it?

A. Yes.

Q. You'll see it says, ""Stated MVA today. Hit by other car from side."" Do you see that?

A. (No verbal reply)

Q. Mrs Foong, can you see where I'm reading, or not?

A. Which ‑ it's on 2 March?

Q. Yes.

HER HONOUR

Q. See, look, it says ""2 March"", down the bottom of the page, ""Stated MVA today.""

A. Yeah, I see, yeah.

Q.

""Hit by other car from side. Plaintiff is driver. Stated seatbelt on. Police on situ. Walking after. No head injury, no LOC. Wants all to be recorded. Complained of left post back aches, left neck aches.""

Nothing about your head.

A. I think I did told them that I got ‑ hit the head.

Q. All right, then--

A. I don't know--

Q. --a week later you go and see the doctor and you get two referrals.

A. (No verbal reply)

FITZSIMMONS

Q. But you see, Mrs Foong, it specifically said, ""No head injury""? Mrs Foong, are you looking at 2 March or have you gone somewhere else?

HER HONOUR

Q. Mrs Foong, look at this page. Look, if you can't look at this page I'll take it out of my volume and I'll give it to you. Now, look, Mrs Foong--

A. Yeah.

Q. --you have to pay attention.

A. The ‑ 18.

Q. Look ‑ no, Mrs Foong.

A. Yeah.

Q. I'm going to give you this document. This is not good, Mrs Foong, you need to help me out here. Now, look, here's the page from my entry. See where I put the yellow Post‑it note? All right, now, I want you to read out aloud the entry for 2 March. Read it out aloud to the Court.

A. I stated, ""MVA today, hit by other car from side.""

Q. Keep going.

A. ""P ..(not transcribable).. is driver, states seatbelt on, police on"" ‑ S-I-T-U, I don't know what is it, ""Working after, no head injury, no LOC. Wants all to be recorded."" See--

Q. You said there was no head injury, didn't you?

A. I don't know, I, I don't ‑ but see here--

FITZSIMMONS

Q. Mrs Foong, just please don't go looking at other things.

A. Okay, okay.

Q You accept that you told your GP on the day of the accident, the very same day, that you did not suffer a head injury and you did not suffer any loss of consciousness?

A. I think I forgot to tell her, I think.

Q. How could you forget, Mrs Foong? How could you forget on the very day of the accident, when you're going to the doctor ‑ how could you forget that you suffered a head injury?

A. I forgot to tell her.

Q. I beg your pardon?

A. I forgot to tell her--

HER HONOUR

Q. That's not--

A. --but anyway--

Q. Mrs Foong, that's not an answer.

A. Right, it's okay, okay.

Q. You were asked how could you have forgotten, if you went to the doctor on the day of the accident, that you had hurt your head? How could you have forgotten that? You tell me. I want to understand your case but you're not helping me.

A. Yeah.

Q. Well, what's your answer?

A. (No verbal reply)

Q. You have to answer, Mrs Foong. It's a long silence.

A. Sorry, cause I, I really couldn't remember how I, I, I told her, and I thought I have told her, but according to here, they said I, I, I, I didn't tell ‑ I didn't her, so--

FITZSIMMONS

Q. Not only did you not tell her, I suggest, I suggest the doctor asked, ""Did you suffer any head injury?"" And you said, ""No, I didn't.""

A. I see, I--

Q. And you were asked, ""Did you lose consciousness at all?"" And you said, ""No, I didn't."" Isn't that the case?

A. I did tell the, the defendant's mother I lost unconscious ‑ lost memory, she knows, but--

Q. Mrs Foong, have you still got page 18 there?

A. Yes, I still have, but the ‑ I meant according to her she, she didn't record it.” (T 112-115)


	
	The plaintiff attended a record of interview on 11 March 2011, nine days after the accident, in respect of trust account anomalies and her failure to account to a vendor for the sum of $80,000 which had been held by the plaintiff on trust. The plaintiff appeared to have been well enough to be able to participate in this interview and to make an undertaking to look into the short fall in the trust account.
	
	
	The plaintiff returned to see her general practitioner on 2 April 2011, shortly after this interview. Her general practitioner again recorded that there was “no head injury” and that she had been conscious and able to walk after the accident.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s focus thereafter in her complaints to the general practitioner related to the injury to her left shoulder (which occurred in her fall in May 2010). She underwent CT scanning of her neck and brain which confirmed no abnormalities (Exhibit 2, page 15; see the doctor’s notes of 2 September 2011).
	
	
	The plaintiff was cross-examined about the injuries she reported to her general practitioner:
	


“Q. Can you go up to 2 April? Do you see that? 2011?

A. Yeah, 2, 2 April.

Q. 2011.

A. It's page ‑ on the same page, yes.

Q. Same page.

A. Yeah.

Q. See further up?

A. Mm.

Q. And this says, ""Initial Consult and Exam."" In other words, examination. See that?

A. Yes.

Q. It says, ""On 2 March 2011 was involved in MVA,"" that's motor vehicle accident, ""was driver, sit on driver's side, son in the car with her. At the time of accident no head injury.""

A. Mm.

Q. See that?

A. Yes.

Q. So again, a month later, when you're back with ‑ and seeing a different doctor altogether--

A. Who was this doctor, then? The--

Q. DJ is the initials. You told that doctor, ""No head injury. Was conscious and able to walk."" See that? That's what you told the doctor, wasn't it? You didn't suffer a head injury?

A. I know according to them they, they, they say it is, but I did tell the defendant's mother, I said that I hit--

Q. And again you didn't tell the doctor that you suffered any loss of consciousness. Correct?

A. According to them here, saying no.

Q. You've just made that up, haven't you, since?

A. No, I, I don't make it up, but I don't know why he's ‑ I, I don't know. I said--

Q. Can you offer to her Honour any explanation why on two separate occasions you didn't tell your own treating doctor that you had suffered a head injury and that you had suffered loss of consciousness? Can you explain that?

A. I ‑ my--

Q. Why you wouldn't have told the doctor?

A. I explanation ‑ the fact is I, I did the ‑ it did hit my head and I did loss unconscious for a few minutes, and I, I have told the defendant's mother. You can ask the defendant's mother to come and tell you.

Q. No, I'm not talking about the defendant's mother, I'm asking about the doctors who you were getting medical advice from. Do you understand? Do you have any explanation--

A. Yes, but I don't know ‑ I can't ‑ I, I don't know why she's write it, I ‑ write it, I, I can't explain, but I, I did, I did tell the defendant, the mother.” (T 115-116)


	
	The plaintiff gave the following evidence concerning her condition in the weeks after the accident:
	


“Q. Now, what do you say was your condition in the weeks after the accident?

A. (No verbal reply)

Q. Mrs Foong, I've asked you a question. Did you hear me?

A. I'm sorry, you asked me a question. What did you say?

Q. What do you say your condition was like in the weeks after the accident? Were you able to do much?

A. Those - I detail things I--

Q. Beg your pardon?

A. I, I ‑ no, I, I didn't ‑ I couldn't do much, no.

Q. Were you able to do anything much at all?

A. I, I tried to do the, the daily things, but I never do ‑ be able to do the, the ‑ those scratching things, the domestic housing ‑ house things, and I tried to occupy myself, to go to do some study, but I ‑ to me if the, the defendant paid me the treatment I should ‑ I, I should treat my, my health.

Q. Didn't you have a trip to Melbourne in the month after the accident?

A. Yes, I did, I, I did got to the Melbourne for my, for my, for my graduation for ‑ what is it for? For my franchising diploma.” (T 116)

The plaintiff’s second accident


	
	On 26 September 2011, the plaintiff was travelling as a bus passenger, returning from seeing a Dr Susan Lawrence concerning the injuries she suffered in the 2 March 2011 accident. At the intersection of Pacific Highway and Ellis Street, Chatswood, the bus had to swerve violently because of the defendant’s vehicle and the plaintiff and other passengers were thrown backwards and forwards. Ambulances were called to assist the passengers and the plaintiff was taken to Royal North Shore Hospital, where she was released after a few hours.
	


Surveillance and social media evidence


	
	The plaintiff was the subject of extensive surveillance footage. Much of it shows her energetically wheeling a suitcase of books around the university faculty where she was studying.
	
	
	The plaintiff was shown a photograph of herself at a tram station carrying luggage. She agreed that she had attended her graduation in Melbourne (T 117) but said it was “the only trip I made after the car accident” (T 117). She denied that this trip was for a holiday, but was asked at T 117-118:
	


“Q. In any event, this is only the month after the accident. You had a holiday down in Victoria.

A. No, it's not holiday. I just went to attend my graduation. After the accident, I never have any holiday.

Q. Do you see it says the entries, someone asked you, ""What are you doing in Victoria?"" Do you see that?

A. Which one?

Q. Page 329.

HER HONOUR

Q. Century Twentyone Uniforms. The man from Century Twentyone Uniforms said, ""What are you doing in Victoria?""

A. Yeah, yes.

FITZSIMMONS

Q. You said, ""Back already, I love Sydney.""

A. Yeah.

Q. And he ‑ and someone else asked you, ""Did you have a nice holiday?""

A. But it was not holiday.

Q. And you said, ""Yes, thank you, Amy. See you next Friday. Time pass quick.""

A. Yes, because I try to be active and I try to be ‑ look, look good and because on that time I was in the ‑ what is it? The Toastmasters, I ‑ it was in Toastmasters, yes.

Q. So I asked you a question before, ""In the weeks after this accident did you do much?"" And you said, ""No."" No, but you went to Melbourne.

A. No, I didn't do much. Don't, don't ‑ this trip is for attending the ‑ attending the graduation.

Q. What sort of condition do you say you were in then?

A. I was not good, but like, like today also I was not good, but I just do it because of - it's necessary to force myself to do it. I'm, I'm not ‑ I'm not well.” (T 117-118)


	
	The above was one of several extracts from the plaintiff’s social media accounts which were tendered. According to her posts on social media, her social and personal life appears to have continued unabated, as did her work and social activities. The plaintiff’s Facebook page also includes references to various properties that she was seeking to sell, including a large commercial estate.
	
	
	The plaintiff complained that the material on her Facebook page and other social media material was irrelevant and should not be tendered. I interpreted this as an application for exclusion of this material pursuant to s 135 Evidence Act 2005 (NSW). I permitted the tender of this material for the following reasons.
	
	
	Tender of social media records in many different kinds of civil and criminal proceedings is now routine. There are no special provisions for the tender of such material, nor is there any need to warn an opponent (as is the case in relation to surveillance material, created by the opposing party and served prior to trial, as occurred here: see r 31.10 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) as to its tender and use).
	
	
	The high water mark, in terms of evidentiary weight, for social media records is to be found in Palavi v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd (2012) 84 NSWLR 523 and Palavi v Radio 2UE Pty Ltd [2011] NSWCA 264, where a plaintiff who failed to produce (and was in fact held to have destroyed) social media-related material in the form of photographs allegedly sent as text messages on her phone had her claims for defamation struck out completely.
	
	
	Social media entries are commonly tendered in personal injury proceedings in relation to claims for damages where a plaintiff is asserted not to have suffered the kind of ongoing disabilities that are claimed to have been suffered. It is a valuable source of material, in that it has been created by the party against whom the material is tendered.
	
	
	It would seem disingenuous for a party who has created such entries to object to their tender, although common sense suggests that some social media entries may well exaggerate or indeed fantasize about the lifestyle of the person who posts the material. These are, however, matters which can be raised in evidence by the party whose posts are challenged (see, for example, Davies v Nilsen [2016] VSC 557 at [35]).
	
	
	My research has not been able to discover any judgments where social media pages have been excluded in evidence in personal injury proceedings under s 135 or for any other reason. To the contrary, entries on LinkedIn and Instagram (Abou Antoun v Chidiac [2017] NSWDC 208), and the ubiquitous Facebook, are increasingly commonly tendered without objection in personal injury proceedings in this court. If there are rulings to the contrary in other courts (in relation to tort claims generally), these are not publicly available. There would need to be significant reasons for excluding material prepared by a party to litigation which directly contradicted, or indeed gave the lie to, sworn testimony in proceedings for damages for tortious wrongdoing. As I have noted after considering this evidence, the facts of this case indicate the reason why there would need to be compelling reasons for the exclusion of such evidence.
	
	
	Accordingly, the material in question was admitted into evidence.
	
	
	After tender of this material was permitted, the plaintiff was asked (at T 118):
	


“Q. You went out to functions, didn't you?

A. Function, I ‑ sometimes I, I feel, I feel the ‑ too bored, because I normally go functions before the car accident, so I, I ‑ now I don't go much, I did go occasions.

Q. Have a look at page 331. See that?

A. Yeah.

Q. Went out to a fundraising night.

A. Yeah, but I sit down only.

Q. 7 May.

A. I just sit there and she ask me to take a photo, I just smile like this, the photo ‑ to take a photo. Now I also, if you ‑ I just make a face.” (T 118)


	
	The plaintiff was also challenged about whether she was working during this time:
	


“Q. You were working all through this time, weren't you?

A. No, I was not working.

Q. Mrs Foong, that's just a lie, isn't it? To say you weren't working?

A. The ‑ sorry ‑ yes, I was working, sorry, yeah.

Q. Yes.

A. Yes.

Q. Have a look at page 332. Got that one? See that? Do you see 14 May 2011? ""What do you think of the advertisement?"" This is from you:

""A white elephant needing a little touching up. We have had problems getting this house ready for inspection. Battle scars are evident in the entrance foyer and to a lesser extent in the family room. Otherwise there is not much wrong with this place.""

Do you see that?

A. Yes.

Q. May 14, ""For sale, $9 million. 40 classrooms, commercial building."" Do you see that?

A. Yes.

Q. You're working all the way through this time, weren't you?

A. Yes, I working - yes.

Q. Why did you say to her Honour a moment ago you weren't working?

A. I, I didn't work up to the, the beginning of June 2011.

Q. I just asked you during this period of time you were working and you said, ""No,"" but then you then, having seen these, you accept you were working?

A. Because the, the date I, I, I look at the day, I was working. Yeah, I was working during the day, during the time.

Q. You were selling, obviously, big commercial real estate properties, is that right?

A. Yes, during that time.

Q. This was during the period of time when you were under investigation by Fair Trading, correct?

A. I'm not sure. I, I think so because I'm confused with those dates. I think so.

Q. You continued to go to other functions to, didn't you?

A. Yes because I, I want to try to, to forget the, the car accidents. I try to hopefully get back my, my memory, my, my focus.” (T 118-119)


	
	The plaintiff was further asked about attending cocktail parties and other social activities with friends:
	


“Q. Page 334, please. This is still only in the months after the accident. 334 there's an entry down the bottom from Amy Him Young(?). Who's that by the way? Is she a friend or a business person or what?

A. I know her through the - what is it--

HER HONOUR

Q. We know you know her. Who is she?

A. Who is she? I'm not sure because I, I--

Q. What do you mean you don't know? She's following you on Facebook and describing you as a friend.

A. I, I know her--

Q. 334, ""Tina, are you coming to my cocktail party Jazz on Bourke on 3 June. It's for a good cause and will be lots of fun. Bring friends.""

A. I don't think I go there. I can't remember. I don't think I go there but she - I, I don't know her personally. I know her through Toastmasters. More than that, private life, I'm not sure. I don't know. That's - we're friend. I really don't know the personal life much, sorry.

FITZSIMMONS

Q. You just said you don't think you went to that event, that's not true is it?

A. I can't--

Q. Have a look up the top of page 334:

""Hey Anna, great that you are coming to the event on Friday night. Is your friend coming too or just one person? Faye and Ron will be there.""

You've said, ""She is not coming,"" that is obviously your friend. Do you see that?

A. I can't remember that, that time.

HER HONOUR

Q. Was that another trip to Melbourne?

A. No, It was in Sydney. It's in Sydney.” (T 119-120)


	
	The plaintiff was not only undertaking further qualifications as an auctioneer in order to either advance or change her career direction, but she was successful in them. On 16 June 2011 the plaintiff stated on social media that she had completed the property auction course that day and would soon be qualified as a property auctioneer. On 24 June 2011 the plaintiff posted that she had received confirmation she was an accredited auctioneer, noting that she would be the first Asian auctioneer, which was a considerable achievement (see page 338 of Exhibit 2).
	
	
	The plaintiff was asked about obtaining her auctioneer’s licence:
	


“Q. You were out pursuing your auctioneer's licence weren't you?

A. I do a lot of - sort, sort of - a lot of different type of things. I, I stop doing that only my health stopped me. Even now I'm very suffering.

HER HONOUR

Q. I'll take that as a yes? You agree that you were pursuing a auctioneer's licence, that's right isn't it?

A. Yes, yes, yeah, I did.

FITZSIMMONS

Q. Can I take you to page 335?

A. Yes.

Q. You see 16 June 2011, ""Just finished the property auction courses today. Do you believe I'm going to be the property auctioneer?""

A. Yes.

Q. That's far from giving up work, is it or not being able to work. Do you accept that?

A. Yeah because I hope my, my health getting better. I don't hope--

Q. I beg your pardon?

A. Because I hope, I hope my health getting better that's why I, I want to move forward.

Q. 24 June, by this stage you've given up work according to the evidence you gave to her Honour. Go to 24 June on page 338. Have you got page 338?

A. 338. Yes.

Q. ""Just received a confirmation that I am an accredited auctioneer. Do you believe I'm the first Asian woman auctioneer, ha."" Do you see that?

A. Yes.

Q. Yet, you're suggesting by this stage you've given up work? That's just patently untrue, isn't it?

A. That's the, the - get the, the auctioneer licence. I'm not unable to work. My health - I can, I can say anything but my health I - doesn't allow me to work.

Q. You can say anything even if it's untrue?

A. No, it's not correct. It's not correct.

Q. What was involved in your getting your auctioneer's licence?

A. Only doing the, the, the course. It's open, open book course.

Q. What's involved? Do you have to attend lectures or courses?

A. Just like seminar, I think. This is--

Q. I beg your pardon?

A. Like, seminar, like, seminar like that.

Q. A seminar?

A. Yes, it's a easy than a, than a course. It's easy because I don't want just to sit there, do nothing. I want to do something, so.

Q. Then you have to do some sort of exam?

A. No, no exams just ask questions and answer the question on open books.

Q. The fact is you are pursuing here, aren't you--

A. I pursued everything, sorry.

Q. Please let me finish. You are pursuing further career opportunities, advancing your career by getting your auctioneer's licence, correct?

A. That's correct but my health stopped me. ” (T 120-122)


	
	It was put to the plaintiff that the problem about her working as an auctioneer was not her health but the loss of her real estate licence:
	


“Q. Do you need your real estate licence to act as an auctioneer?

A. Yes, you do. You do.

Q. You can't operate as an auctioneer whilst you haven't got your real estate licence?

A. That's correct, yes.

Q. This was around the time when the proceedings were being taken or the Fair Trading were taking their proceedings against you, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. You were pursuing the auctioneer's licence but ultimately you couldn't work as an auctioneer because you had your real estate licence taken from you, correct?

A. Yes, that's correct but I, I do that because I, I was hoping I keep, keep my licence and--

Q. You were hoping to keep your licence so you could continue working as a real estate agent and indeed as an auctioneer, is that right?

A. When my health permit me to do so, yes. When the, the - my health permit me to do so.

Q. You were pursuing these things this time because your health permitted you to do it, didn't you?

A. I forced myself to do it like today. I forced myself to do it. I'm, I'm, I'm not feeling well but because I force myself to, to do it. The--

Q. What do you say was stopping you from working as a real estate agent at this time?

A. Sorry?

Q. If it wasn't being struck off as a real estate agent--

A. Yeah.

Q. --what was it that was stopping you from working as a real estate agent, physically from a health perspective? What was the problem?

A. If what? If, if the, the licence not get struck?

Q. Yes, you're saying that you not working didn't have anything to do with losing your licence. It was because of your health that you couldn't work?

A. That's correct, yes.

Q. What was it, in terms of your health, that stopped you from working?

A. Because of my, my shoulder sore and my back sore and also sometimes my memory is not that clear and my - even now my, my whole body's sore.” (T 122-123)


	
	The plaintiff had other difficulties which would have prevented her career in real estate from progressing. After a separate interview by Fair Trading of the plaintiff’s son (Keen Joi Foong) on 21 June 2011, he contradicted her statements that he had signed an exclusive agency agreement and denied that the document in question bore his signature. The plaintiff was given a Notice to Show Cause under s 195 Property, Stock and Business Agents Act 2002 (NSW) as to why disciplinary action should not be taken and findings were made by the Department of Fair Trading that on 4 April 2010 the sum of $80,000 had been transferred for “renovations” by the plaintiff. The plaintiff had sought to argue that this was renovation work done on the purchaser’s property (see Exhibit 2, pages 102-105), but this was not accepted, and on 19 September 2011, Fair Trading issued a Notice of Determination to take Disciplinary Action under s 198 of the Act. The plaintiff was declared a disqualified person for the purposes of the Act for a period of five years to take effect from early October 2011.
	
	
	While these events were occurring, the plaintiff suffered her second accident on 26 September 2011 while riding on a bus on the Pacific Highway. The plaintiff claims she was thrown forwards towards the front seat and hit the back of the seat, and that her shoulders hit the back of the chair as she was thrown forward. An ambulance attended and took the plaintiff to the Royal North Shore Hospital where she was treated and released shortly thereafter.
	
	
	Within two days of this accident, the plaintiff was making representations to the Department of Fair Trading to have her licence returned. The Department of Fair Trading did not accept the plaintiff’s submissions, although she warned them of the consequences:
	


“You disqualify my license, you will take full responsible (sic) for loss of my future income, reputation, and effect the ability to get any type of license from any organisations including the Government.”


	
	This letter, which was written shortly after the second accident, sheets home loss of the plaintiff’s real estate licence and business to the actions of the Department of Fair Trading rather than to injuries suffered in the motor vehicle and bus accidents which are the subject of these proceedings.
	
	
	On 3 September 2012 the plaintiff appeared before this Court in its criminal jurisdiction in a severity appeal from a sentence by a Local Court Magistrate of 15 months’ imprisonment to be served by way of home detention. That order was confirmed on appeal, although a non-parole period of 9 months was imposed by way of variation (Exhibit 2, page 186).
	
	
	Judge Zahra was told by Mr Healey, who appeared for the plaintiff:
	


“[The plaintiff] has the future intention to repay [the amount of $80,000 which is the subject of the charge] from wages earned as and when she is able, but currently is reliant on Centrelink benefits and has no means to commence repayment until she is in paid employment.” (Exhibit 2, page 173)


	
	The Court was told that the plaintiff “clearly has a very strong work ethic” and that subsequent to her disqualification, she had been studying accounting and conveyancing at Ultimo TAFE (Exhibit 2, Transcript 177).
	
	
	While Mr Healey of counsel noted that it was most unlikely she could ever be registered as an accountant or conveyancer, he told the court the plaintiff wanted to avoid a custodial sentence and that she was “skilling herself” and could go into customer service or retrain as an interpreter to earn money to repay what was stolen (Exhibit 2, pages 177-178).
	
	
	In other words, the Court was told in the clearest possible terms that the plaintiff was a woman with a “very strong work ethic” (a statement Mr Healey used several times in his submissions; this example is drawn from Exhibit 2, page 178), not someone struggling with injuries from two road accidents. Repeated submission were made to the court that the plaintiff was “getting back into the workforce” (Exhibit 2, page 179) so that she could raise the money to pay the $80,000.
	
	
	All of this was taken into account by Judge Zahra, who was never informed that the plaintiff had suffered any accident at all, let alone accidents which could result in her being unable to work at all, although the plaintiff had in fact already lodged accident claim forms for each of the accidents and was under surveillance.
	
	
	The surveillance tapes at various periods during 2012 confirm the picture painted to the court of the plaintiff as a busy and active woman who was successfully pursuing tertiary education.
	


The medical evidence


	
	The medical evidence paints a consistent picture of the plaintiff as a person who claims substantial and serious injury which is unsupported by investigative reports and described by the practitioners who have seen her as being largely feigned.
	


Professor Aggarwal


	
	The Court has been assisted by a series of treating reports from Associate Professor Aggarwal from 18 January 2012 onwards (see Exhibit 2, page 225). His exhaustive and sympathetic attempts to find out what was wrong with the plaintiff over a three-year period are instructive.
	
	
	Professor Aggarwal’s initial description of the plaintiff’s account of her injuries and ongoing disabilities, in his report of 18 January 2012, painted a gloomy picture of her injuries and inability to work. She did not inform Professor Aggarwal that she had been prevented from working due to her conduct in relation to the operation of a trust account and was in fact engaged in tertiary study, instead telling him that she had had to cease work in June 2011 as a consequence of changes in memory and concentration “to a point where she had to cease work in June 2011” (paragraph 2, Exhibit 2, page 225).
	
	
	This was complicated by the second accident in September 2011, the plaintiff told Professor Aggarwal, as she has “continued to notice a reduction in her memory and concentration” after that time and had had a number of episodes where she “has lost awareness of her surroundings for a short period of time, especially when she has been driving and she stops in the middle of the road”. This is said to be the reason why she had ceased driving. This was in fact also untruthful, in that the plaintiff had ceased driving for entirely unrelated reasons, as is set out below.
	
	
	Professor Aggarwal took these complaints seriously. He initially considered she might be experiencing post-traumatic epilepsy and arranged for an EEG. The normal results of her EEG contradicted this. However, he gave her the benefit of the doubt. Given the plaintiff’s “significant cognitive symptoms”, he next sought the performance of an MRI at the insurer’s expense, considering that this may explain the drop in her level of cognition after her September accident. She had an MRI scan at her own expense, the results of which were normal.
	
	
	Next, Professor Aggarwal suggested a neuropsychological assessment (report 30 March 2012, Exhibit 2, page 230). By 1 June 2012 Professor Aggarwal was recommending that she should “try to reintegrate back into the workforce” (Exhibit 2, page 231) and was puzzled by her symptoms but still searching for a medical answer.
	
	
	In his report of 1 May 2015, Professor Aggarwal noted very poor scores on mental tests were continuing, and considered she had some signs of Parkinsonism. However, by 22 December 2015, after a formal neuropsychological assessment was performed, Professor Aggarwal was satisfied that the plaintiff was consciously performing badly throughout the test and that she was “looking for avenues for compensation” which he considered were unlikely to be fruitful. This renowned specialist had spent nearly three years endeavouring to determine the plaintiff’s problems. He reluctantly, but politely, came to the conclusion that she was exaggerating her symptoms for the purposes of obtaining compensation. I set out his report in full:
	


“Mrs Foong came back for review.

She feels there has been a slight improvement in her mobility since commencing Madopar at a dose of 100/25 ½ tablet twice per day. She is tolerating this medication well without side effects. She also feels that the numbness of her right hand has been reasonably well controlled.

Mrs Foong has had a formal neuropsychological assessment. I have not received the formal report yet, but a verbal report indicated that her effort was not consistent during the assessment and it seemed that she was consciously performing badly throughout the test. There was no evidence to suggest any organic brain injury and it was felt that her performance was deliberately poor.

On examination, Mrs Foong’s gait remains slow but steady. She still had reduced arm swing on the right. Her tone was still increased in the upper limbs, and she had ongoing bradykinesia of find finger movements. She had no tremor at rest. Upper limb nerve conduction studies showed that her right carpal tunnel syndrome has improved. EMG studies showed no evidence of denervation and upper limb somatosensory evoked potentials were normal

Mrs Foong still has some organic signs of Parkinsonism and I have suggested she increase her dose of Madopar slowly to 100/25 1 tablet 3 times per day to optimise the benefit of this medication.

I have advised her regarding the results of the neuropsychological assessment, indicating that she has no evidence of organic brain injury and that it was felt that her perceived cognitive impairment is subjective and with no objective signs. She still seems to be looking for avenues for compensation and I have indicated to her that it is unlikely that these avenues will be fruitful to her.

I would like to review her again in another 3 months time.”

   [Emphasis added]


	
	If there had been anything wrong with the plaintiff in terms of a head injury or brain damage, this exhaustive series of tests would have discovered it. Professor Aggarwal’s final report confirms that the plaintiff was shamming her symptoms in the hope of compensation.
	


Dr Bodel


	
	The plaintiff was also reviewed by Dr James Bodel on 27 August 2012 in relation to her physical injuries.
	
	
	Once again, the history the plaintiff provided to Dr Bodel was inconsistent with the contemporaneous evidence of what was in fact occurring. She told Dr Bodel that shortly after returning to work she was struggling and had to go off work for a few weeks, finding that by June 2011 she was unable to continue and had to close the business down. She did not mention the reasons that she was in difficulties working as a real estate agent, or about her studies or her other activities.
	
	
	She demonstrated to Dr Bodel a full range of shoulder movements on the right hand side, but only slightly reduced movement on the left, as well as reporting a restricted range of movement in the back. As the 2012 surveillance video shows, this was exaggerated.
	
	
	Dr Bodel’s report uncritically accepted the plaintiff’s evidence. However, the facts given to Dr Bodel are totally at variance with the plaintiff’s very busy life of study and attending proceedings in court. The value of his report must be materially undermined by these differences, and accordingly I can place no weight upon it.
	


Dr Robert Hampshire and Ms Natalie Windsor


	
	Dr Hampshire examined the plaintiff on 30 October 2013. His report contains a number of inconsistencies. His observations as to the plaintiff’s level of depression is inconsistent with his own observations as well as with the objective facts of the plaintiff’s real reason for ceasing work as a real estate agent.
	
	
	As is the case with Dr Bodel, the misleading and untruthful statements made to him by the plaintiff, which were relied upon by him uncritically, must materially undermine any finding of fact that he has made.
	
	
	Dr Hampshire’s assessment of whole person impairment is inconsistent with the psychiatric evidence relied upon by the defendants, including the reports of Dr Selwyn-Smith, Professor Mattick and the MAS Assessor Dr Friend.
	
	
	Similarly, Ms Natalie Windsor’s report concerning the treatment she provided as a psychologist were based on an uncritical acceptance of the plaintiff’s untruthful evidence concerning her disabilities and inability to work, and is of no assistance.
	


The defendants' medico-legal evidence


	
	The defendants' reports confirm the observations of Professor Aggarwal.
	


Dr Michael Lim


	
	Dr Lim’s first report of 29 February 2012, concerning an assessment on 14 February 2012, notes the plaintiff as complaining of the following symptoms:
	



	
	The left side of her body is constantly numb;
	
	
	Her head is numb;
	
	
	She cannot hear properly out of her left ear;
	
	
	She suffers headaches;
	
	
	She suffers from left shoulder pain and cannot lift her left arm;
	
	
	She cannot lift her right arm since the second motor vehicle accident;
	
	
	Her lower back is sore;
	
	
	Her left knee is sore.
	



	
	She told Dr Lim that she stopped working after the accident “because she could not remember to do things” (p 6).
	
	
	On physical examination, the plaintiff displayed to Dr Lim about half the normal range of movements but he noted that her neck movements were quite normal during the interview and she was able to rotate her cervical spine at other times.
	
	
	Dr Lim makes the following observations at p 9 of his report:
	


“10.g Consistency of presentation

The claimant presented as manipulative. For instance, she was keen for me to believe that she sustained a head injury in the subject accident, even supplying me with a note (see below) after the assessment that alleged direct injury to her head, contrary to what she told me during the interview and also contrary to her medical records (see section 12). She failed to mention that she had been experiencing left parietal headache prior to the accident (see section 12).

She also expressed conviction that the proposed operation to her left should was attributable to the subject accident even though she acknowledged that her surgeon had proposed the operation prior to the accident. She stated that she did not believe the left shoulder condition prior to the accident was serious enough to warrant surgery but in the medical records (entry of 30 August 2010) she stated she could not afford surgery. She provided me with scant details of her employment prior to the accident. The medical records indicated that she had reduced her work hours following the fall on 11 May 2010. She told me that she did not work after the subject accident. However, the medical records did not indicate that was the case. Dr Aggarwal noted in his report of 18 January 2012 that the claimant ceased work for 2 weeks. She then resumed work and continued working until June 2011.”


	
	The note referred to by Dr Lim read as follows:
	


“Dear Dr Lim,

I forgot to tell you that the 2/3/11 accident. I just remember.

I have hit my back head. Please shade the diagram for me. Thank you.

Yours faithfully,

Yena Foong”


	
	Dr Lim was of the view that the plaintiff’s motor vehicle accident resulted only in mild soft tissue injuries to her neck, upper back and left chest and that no other injury was attributable to the accident of 2 March 2011 or 26 September 2011. He noted her medical investigation results showed tears to the rotator cuff, but he points out that the report of Dr Matthew Sherlock of 3 August 2010 showed an acute or chronic tear of the left shoulder prior to the accident, and that Dr Sherlock’s recommendation for surgery included the likelihood of further surgery for the plaintiff’s right shoulder (p 12), as well as her injured left shoulder.
	
	
	Dr Lim provided a second report dated 25 February 2013. He noted by way of update that she had not undergone any operation or suffered any further accident and she was unable to explain what treatment, if any, she had received from Dr Aggrawal:
	


“8. Additional remarks

The claimant complained incessantly about the ruinous effect of the subject accident:

-   She stopped having sex because of the 2 MVAs. Her husband now has “very bad health” because she stopped giving him sex.

-   She stated that the accident caused “a lot of unhappiness and family problems”.

-   She alleged ongoing work incapacity attributable to the accident. She complained she has not received any money from the insurer. She stated that a claims officer from Allianz told her on 24 November 2012 that the company would pay her but she still has not received any money.

-   She stated that her children relied on her for money. I pointed out that her sons are adults. She replied that 2 of her sons are still students.

I told the claimant that I found no evidence in the relevant documents that she injured her head in the subject accident and I was not able to attribute her alleged memory problems to the accident. Her reply was “what about the lump on my head?” She pointed to the left parietal region to indicate the location of the lump. (In a handwritten note left at my office after the previous assessment, the claimant alleged she struck the back of her head in the subject accident. A blow to the back of the head would not cause a lump in the left parietal region of her scalp).”


	
	He made the following additional observations:
	


“12.01 Diagnosis

After re-examining the claimant and reviewing additional clinical material, I reaffirm the opinions I previously expressed that:

-   The subject accident resulted in mild soft tissue injuries to the claimant’s neck (cervical spine) and upper back (thoracic spine) and left chest.

-   There was no other injury attributable to the accident. In particular, the accident did not result in injury to the claimant’s head, left shoulder or left knee.

12.02 Prognosis

After re-examining the claimant and reviewing additional clinical material, I reaffirm the opinions I previously expressed that:

-   The injuries caused by the accident were mild in nature and would have resolved over a matter of a few weeks or a few months.

-   The injuries did not affect the claimant’s life expectancy.

12.03 Are the reported disabilities consistent with the injuries caused by the subject accident?

No.

I believe the claimant has genuine physical disabilities arising from her left shoulder and left knee. Such disabilities were pre-existing at the time of the subject accident. There was no evidence that the accident resulted in further injury (or aggravation) to her left shoulder or left knee.

The claimant’s presentation suggested the presence of underlying psychiatric disorders, possibly somatoform disorder, depression and personality disorder. A psychiatric assessment is recommended.”


	
	He had the following to say about her proposed treatment:
	


“12.04 Treatment

After re-examining the claimant and reviewing additional clinical material, I reaffirm the opinions I previously expressed that:

-   The chiropractic treatments and doctor consultations within 3 months of the accident were reasonable and necessary under the circumstances.

-   The use of prescribed medication up to 3 months of the accident was reasonable and necessary under the circumstances.

-   No other treatment was necessary in relation to the subject accident.”


	
	He estimated that impairment of her past earning capacity was for two weeks only (p 8 of the report).
	
	
	Dr Lim provided a third report dated 8 July 2016, confirm that the first and second motor vehicle accidents resulted in mild injuries only which had fully recovered and that her ongoing symptoms were “most probably feigned” (p 1) and that he adhered to the same view despite the most recently provided material, including his observation that her work capacity had been affected only for a period of two weeks.
	
	
	Dr Lim’s long and careful reports are of great assistance in the determination of the plaintiff’s problems. She has genuine physical disabilities which were pre-existing at the time of the accident, and there is no evidence of the injured she incurred in either of the accidents resulted in any further injury or aggravation to her shoulders or knees. He concludes, and I agree, that what the plaintiff suffers from is an underlying psychiatric disorder or disorders, which he suggested were potentially somatoform disorder, depression and personality disorder. These were unrelated to the accident.
	


Dr Cummine


	
	Dr Cummine provided two reports dated 1 May 2014 and 4 August 2016. He noted that she had pre-existing shoulder injuries as a result of her fall in a hotel on 11 May 2010 and that she also suffered significant degenerative change in her right shoulder. She also had osteoarthritis of the right knee. None of these related to or were exacerbated by the injuries she suffered in the accidents the subject of this claim (p 9).
	
	
	He also notes that between these two accidents she suffered physical assault on 15 May 2011 and that this resulted in neck pain, bilateral shoulder pain (the left worse than the right), as well as back pain.
	
	
	Dr Cummine did not consider her complaints and the disabilities described as reasonable and considered there was no direct relationship between her complaints and the respective accident. He considered that she suffered from underlying pre-existing degenerative disease which, combined with abnormal illness behaviour, had become part of a chronic pain syndrome unrelated to the accident. He confirmed this view in his report of 4 August 2016, noting a series of reports from Professor Mattick, Associate Professor Spira and Dr Dalton, with all of which he was in agreement.
	


Associate Professor Spira


	
	Associate Professor Spira provided two reports. In the first of these, dated 14 August 2014, he noted her diffused complaints of pain and injury, ranging from visual disturbance (“I just cannot see”) to continuous symptoms of numbness and pain over most of her body, as well as memory difficulties, hearing problems and depression. She had fallen asleep in the waiting room and told him that she had to rest repeatedly because she becomes severely fatigued, but he observed that she displayed what he would describe as remarkable stamina in that she maintained her concentration throughout an almost four-hour consultation without difficulty despite the complexity of her issues. He noted her gait as to walked as being “quite bizarre with her taking tiny steps and shuffling although there were no manifestations of an extrapyramidal disorder”. She said that this was to prevent knee pain. She recoiled in pain from pressure on her back and neck which “barely indented subcutaneous fat” (p 8). He concluded that there were clear features of embellishment of disability and of complaints about severe pain where there was no pain at all. He considered it was highly unlikely that any of her disabilities (if she had any) resulted from the motor vehicle accident.
	
	
	Associate Professor Spira was also of the opinion that she did not have any mental state impairment. He considered she was “an unreliable witness to her level of symptomatology” (p 9).
	
	
	In his report of 4 July 2016, Associate Professor Spira reviewed four folders of additional documents which he considered confirmed his view as well as demonstrating that “there has been a broad consensus in relation to the nature of Mrs Foong’s complaints and their non-organic nature”, notably her “intentionally poor performance” in a test carried out by the neuropsychology unit at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital on 17 December 2015.
	


Dr Dalton


	
	Dr Dalton provided two reports dated 1 October 2014 and 29 June 2016. He concluded:
	


“This lady presents with Abnormal Illness Behaviour, non-organic clinical signs and a number of inconsistencies were clearly demonstrated during the assessment. There is considerable psychological and functional overlay and the reported disabilities and complaints are disproportionate to injuries sustained in the subject accident and objective clinical findings, notwithstanding the fact that this lady does have confirmed degenerative pathologies affecting both shoulders.”


	
	His follow-up report confirmed this view and he noted the consensus of opinions by other medical practitioners that there was “significant exaggeration and embellishment of her psychological symptoms and cognitive dysfunction” (p 2) which confirmed his earlier diagnosis.
	


Dr Newlyn


	
	Dr Newlyn had the advantage of seeing the plaintiff comparatively early, namely on 9 February 2012. He provides a long and comprehensive review of relevant medical records for the period up until that time. He considered that she did not have any psychiatric disorder.
	
	
	In his report of 25 July 2016, Dr Newlyn noted that he had been provided with extensive reports from other medical practitioners, including Dr Lim, Professor Mattick, Dr Cummine, Dr Selwyn-Smith, Associate Professor Spira and Dr Dalton, as well as the MAS Assessor Mr Cameron.
	
	
	He was also aware of the contents of the report of Natalie Windsor, psychologist, who considered that the accident had left her with significant psychological trauma resulting in post-traumatic stress disorder. His opinion remained the same.
	


Other medical reports


	
	The defendants also relied upon the MAS assessments and the reports of Professor Mattick and Dr Selwyn-Smith. These reports were consistent with the reports set out above.
	


The plaintiff’s claim for damages


	
	The plaintiff, in a document headed “Statement of Order” sets out her quantification of the claim for $20,665,550, being the sum set out in this document plus an additional $270 for taxi expenses:

	The document in question does not comply with the general manner in which such claims are made, but in the course of oral submissions, it has been explained to me as follows:
	



	
	Non-economic loss – The plaintiff claims $3,000,000 for head injuries and “psychology” injuries, despite falling below the threshold for non-economic loss.
	
	
	Past and future economic loss – The plaintiff has provided calculations totalling $15,780,438 for past and future economic loss which in fact goes back to 2010, the year prior to the accident.
	
	
	Other economic loss – The plaintiff claims the cost of a replacement unit in North Sydney ($1,000,000), as a “loss of a chance”.
	
	
	Home care – The plaintiff makes a claim for commercial paid care to 88 years of age ($300,000) and an additional sum of $150,000 to “[m]obilise, and employ people to lift up heavy objects, and marriage separation, and quality of life, and quality of food to age 88”.
	
	
	Other expenses – The plaintiff also claims legal costs, court costs, printing costs, storage costs, moving costs, accountant costs and other expenses up to 5 October 2017 totalling $234,842.
	
	
	Additional expenditure – The plaintiff also claims taxi expenses of $270.
	



	
	The above calculation also includes claims for out-of-pocket expenses of $11,064, legal costs of $116,873.18 but do not appear to include future medical expenses. I was informed that Schedule E, which refers to a claim for $200,000 included future out-of-pocket expenses, although the basis for this claim was unclear.
	
	
	The defendants' calculation may be noted as amounting to reimbursement of past s 83 expenses which for the first accident are $5,302.24 and for the second accident $550. The large size of the expenses for the first accident relates to the cost of investigations since the date of the accident as opposed to treatment at the time. The difference between the past out-of-pocket expenses estimate of the defendants and the plaintiff’s estimate is that the plaintiff has claimed for all HIC or medical expenses since the accident without nominating which of these relates to the accident in question.
	
	
	A great deal of the evidence in this case related to whether the plaintiff’s claim of being in consistent unbearable pain should be accepted by the court, an issue which the defendants resolve by referring to the plaintiff’s lack of credit.
	


The plaintiff’s credit


	
	Mr Fitzsimmons draws my attention to Thornton v Telegraph Media Group Ltd [2011] EWHC 1884 (QB) at 72, a helpful summary of credit issues which is often referred to in personal injury proceedings. He particularly draws my attention to the text by Sir Richard Eggleston QC, “Evidence, proof and probability” (1st Ed., Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1978), which identifies the following five tests:
	


“(1) The consistency of the witness’s evidence with what is agreed, or clearly shown by other evidence, to have occurred;

(2) The internal consistency of the witness’s evidence;

(3) Consistency with what the witness has said or deposed on other occasions;

(4) The credit of the witness in relation to matters not germane to the litigation;

(5) The demeanour of the witness.”


	
	The evidence of the plaintiff’s lack of credibility is, to use Mr Fitzsimmons’ language (at paragraph 91 of his submissions), overwhelming. Any claim that she lost the ability to work in general, let alone work as a real estate agent, must be patently untrue for the following reasons:
	



	
	The evidence is inconsistent with the plaintiff’s posts on social media concerning her work success and studies. She remained actively engaged in her profession up to the last possible time before her licence was not renewed after June 2011.
	
	
	The plaintiff continued to attempt to renew her licence and to appeal the decisions of the Department of Fair Trading and the Local Magistrate.
	
	
	The plaintiff told Judge Zahra through her counsel in September 2012 that while it was unlikely that she would obtain work as a real estate agent or accountant because of her conviction, she would be doing her best to be gainfully employed if given the opportunity, and this was the reason for seeking that the custodial sentence to be served by way of home detention should be overturned.
	
	
	The plaintiff was able to complete a very busy study program including some extra studies to finish the course quickly and, as the surveillance tape shows, she was able to walk vigorously.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s exaggerated claims of having suffered significant injuries in both accidents, which include alleged head injuries and consequential loss of consciousness, are inconsistent with contemporaneous medical reports which show her either not making any such complaint at all, or, when she complained to Professor Aggarwal, giving normal results when tested. All three specialists who tested the plaintiff’s mental functioning concluded the plaintiff was deliberately feigning her mental impairment to a significant degree, including (reluctantly, and only after all other tests were exhausted) Professor Aggarwal.
	



	
	The plaintiff’s demeanour in the witness box should also be taken into account. She only reluctantly conceded (at T 220) that the real reason for her inability to pursue her real estate career was her disqualification and criminal conviction in the middle of 2011, before the second accident occurred (T 220) and when she was shown the video surveillance, she attempted to argue with the very clear picture of her walking rapidly and vigorously in high heels, asserting it was “misleading” (T 218). She continued to assert that she could not lift heavy items, despite being shown surveillance of having lifted a trolley bag of books on 20 March 2014 (T 220-221 and 283-285).
	
	
	In the course of the proceedings, it transpired that the plaintiff has been appointed as a justice of the peace, with her appointment expiring on 31 December 2017. The plaintiff should not have continued to hold her appointment as a justice of the peace in light of the findings of the Department of Fair Trading and her subsequent criminal conviction. The plaintiff conceded she was aware of her obligation to disclose adverse findings. Although this is only a small point, it is an indication of the plaintiff’s willingness to mislead others.
	


Conclusions concerning the plaintiff’s injuries and disabilities


	
	All of the medical evidence points to the plaintiff suffering mild soft tissue injuries in each of the accidents from which she has recovered within weeks at best, and in circumstances where she has been able to go about her normal duties almost without interruption. There is no evidence of her having days off work and the contemporaneous medical reports are inconsistent with her later claims of significant injury.
	
	
	As to the plaintiff’s claim of psychiatric injury, I note the requirements of s 31 Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW). The plaintiff has not suffered any psychiatric condition or associated mental or intellectual disorder as a consequence of either of the accidents.
	
	
	The plaintiff called evidence of a “character” nature from persons who had known her as a real estate agent, such as Ms Fay Petru. Ms Petru readily acknowledged that she knew nothing about the circumstances in which the plaintiff ceased work as a real estate agent, saying that the plaintiff had never given her reason for doing so (T 326).
	


Non-economic loss


	
	The plaintiff is not entitled to any non-economic loss.
	


Economic loss


	
	The plaintiff sought to call evidence from an accountant as to the economic loss she had suffered. Mr Kenneth Leo attended court and was cross-examined. He told the Court in a frank and straightforward fashion that he had never prepared an economic loss report for the Court before. He had never heard of the Code of Conduct and had not taken it into account when preparing his report. In those circumstances, his report, which consisted simply of ascertaining company profit plus personal income to ascertain net income, was inadmissible.
	
	
	These reports were not only inadmissible, but were based on a completely false premise. The plaintiff could not claim from the defendants for economic loss (past or future) in relation to her real estate company activities in circumstances where she had been prosecuted for an offence of financial dishonesty and been relieved of her real estate agent’s licence for a lengthy period which has still not yet expired. The only basis upon which the plaintiff could bring a claim for economic loss would be for work in the general workforce following her second accident (the evidence in relation to the first accident pointing to her continuing to work full-time as a real estate agent until her licence was withdrawn in June).
	
	
	Even the very financial records produced by the plaintiff as being “income tax returns” are uncertain. These income tax returns have never been submitted to the Australian Tax Office for assessment, as the plaintiff herself conceded (at T 233). They appear to have been prepared solely for the benefit of these proceedings. As such, they are not business records.
	
	
	Finally, I note that on 12 September 2016 the plaintiff completed a further claim for a bus accident on 22 March 2016. In the claim form she asserted that she was a full-time university student and that as a consequence of the accident she reduced her study load to part-time. Whatever impact this third accident may have upon the plaintiff’s earning capacity, her statements in relation to this third accident indicate that she was capable of undertaking full-time study following the accidents, which is inconsistent with her claim that she is unable to perform any activity of an income-bearing nature. In addition, it is clear that the plaintiff is taking steps to re-qualify with the intention of engaging in remunerative employment in the future.
	
	
	I am thus not satisfied that the plaintiff has suffered anything other than an amount representing one or two days’ absence from work, at most. Dr Lim suggested an absence of up to two weeks might be reasonable. Precise determination of this sum is difficult given the uncertainty of the plaintiff’s financial record-keeping.
	
	
	There should be no award for future economic loss, as I am satisfied that the plaintiff suffered no compensable injury beyond soft tissue injuries, which resolved within days or weeks of the accident in question.
	
	
	I am prepared to award a modest cushion for past economic loss of $1,000 for each of the two accidents, to allow for the two weeks of absence which Dr Lim thought would be appropriate. That will be the total of the plaintiff’s claim for past and future economic loss.
	


Past and future domestic assistance


	
	Section 141B Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 (NSW) provides:
	


“141B Maximum Amount of Damages for Provision of Certain Attendant Care Services

(1) Compensation, included in an award of damages, for the value of attendant care services:

(a) which have been or are to be provided by another person to the person in whose favour the award is made, and

(b) for which the person in whose favour the award is made has not paid and is not liable to pay,

must not exceed the amount determined in accordance with this section.

(2) No compensation is to be awarded if the services would have been provided to the person even if the person had not been injured by the motor accident.

(3) Further, no compensation is to be awarded unless the services are provided (or to be provided):

(a) for at least 6 hours per week, and

(b) for a period of at least 6 consecutive months.

(4) If the services provided or to be provided are not less than 40 hours per week, the amount of compensation must not exceed:

(a) the amount per week comprising the amount estimated by the Australian Statistician as the average weekly total earnings of all employees in New South Wales for:

(i) in respect of the whole or any part of a quarter occurring between the date of the injury in relation to which the award is made and the date of the award, being a quarter for which such an amount has been estimated by the Australian Statistician and is, at the date of the award, available to the court making the award--that quarter, or

(ii) in respect of the whole or any part of any other quarter--the most recent quarter occurring before the date of the award for which such an amount has been estimated by the Australian Statistician and is, at that date, available to the court making the award, or

(b) if the Australian Statistician fails or ceases to estimate the amount referred to in paragraph (a), the prescribed amount or the amount determined in such manner or by reference to such matters, or both, as may be prescribed.

(5) If the services provided or to be provided are less than 40 hours per week, the amount of compensation must not exceed the amount calculated at an hourly rate of one-fortieth of the amount determined in accordance with subsection (4) (a) or (b), as the case requires.

(6) Unless evidence is adduced to the contrary, the court is to assume that the value of the services is the maximum amount determined under subsection (4) or (5), as the case requires.

(7) Except as provided by this section, nothing in this section affects any other law relating to the value of attendant care services.”


	
	The Court must be satisfied that the plaintiff has been provided with domestic assistance of at least 6 hours per week for a continuous period of 6 months.
	
	
	The plaintiff has adduced no such evidence; to the contrary, she appears to have been providing domestic and other assistance to her son Genn Foong who was injured in the first accident (T 157-161; see also Exhibit 4). Nor is it the case that the plaintiff suffers from any relevant disability requiring domestic assistance. Not only is there no evidence from any occupational therapist (Boral Bricks Pty Ltd v Cosmidis [2013] NSWCA 443), but the plaintiff gave no evidence of any intention to engage commercial assistance in the future (Miller v Galderisi [2009] NSWCA 353).
	
	
	Accordingly, there should be no award for past or future domestic assistance.
	


Past and future treatment expenses


	
	Although I invited the parties to reach agreement as to what past treatment expenses there would be, the plaintiff has not done so. She refers in her lengthy (and unpaginated) submissions to such matters as “travel costs claim”.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the plaintiff is not entitled to any future out-of-pocket expenses, but I am prepared to award a cushion of $250 for each accident in question for medication of a non-prescription nature for pain relief.
	
	
	The defendants asked to be given credit for a total of $5,852.24 for past out-of-pocket expenses. To avoid the possibility of a medical disbursement being attributed to the wrong claim, I have simply excluded the sums agreed to by the defendants from the amounts awarded.
	


Concluding remarks


	
	I thank Mr Fitzsimmons for his careful preparation and presentation and the fairness with which he has responded to and assisted Mrs Foong in the preparation of her case.
	
	
	Mrs Foong is in many ways a tragic figure, in that after a number of years in the workforce she got into financial difficulties which impacted on her career, as well as causing her personal difficulties. However, that does not entitle her to claim damages to which she is not otherwise entitled.
	
	
	As a litigant in person, Mrs Foong is not entitled to legal costs. She is entitled to disbursements of the kind that litigants in person may claim: see Cachia v Hanes [1994] HCA 14.
	
	
	While the smallness of the size of the claim would otherwise attract the costs penalties under r 42.35 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW), her son (a passenger in her vehicle) was injured in the first motor vehicle accident. He was awarded substantial damages in a settlement. I am satisfied that it was appropriate to commence both proceedings in the same court.
	
	
	Mrs Foong sought payment of legal costs totalling $116,873.18 for her former solicitors’ costs. I have, however, reserved the issue of costs, at the request of counsel for the defendants.

The plaintiff’s claims for defamation


	
	These are proceedings for defamation for two publications, one of which is asserted to be a poster in a shop window and the other a conversation behind the plaintiff and the person behind the counter in the shop.
	
	
	The first matter complained of is pleaded to be a sign placed on a shop window in July 2016, consisting of the photograph of an unidentified woman (the plaintiff, according to identification evidence), and with the word “THIEF!” in capital letters above and below (“the poster publication”). This poster is claimed to have remained on the shop window from an unknown date in early July (the statement of claim refers to 6 July 2016) up until at least 13 July 2016 (when the plaintiff visited the shop), and for an unspecified time thereafter.
	
	
	The second matter complained of is an oral publication (“the oral publication”), between the plaintiff and defendant on or about 13 July 2016 as follows (paragraph 5 of the Amended Statement of Claim):
	


Plaintiff: “I am the person in the picture in the window. Can you take the picture down please. I did not steal anything.”

Defendant: “No. I am not taking it down. I have spoken to my solicitor and I am allowed to hang it up there. It is my property and it is not coming down. I will show you on the footage what you have done.”

Defendant (showing some video footage): “See, see you take your hands in and out of your pockets five times. That is five items you have stolen. Who takes their hands in an [sic] out of their pockets that isn’t stealing. This footage says it all?”

Plaintiff: “I didn’t. I swear I didn’t. I didn’t know I was taking my hands in and out. I do this without thinking. I didn’t steal anything. Take it to the part in the footage where I put all my stuff on the counter and paid for it.”

Defendant: “No. I am not going through this anymore. You are a thief.”

Plaintiff: “Please, I didn’t do it. I promise. Take it down.”

Defendant: “No, you’re a thief. The cameras say it all.”

Plaintiff: “I am going to call the police.”

Defendant: “Go ahead. I work very closely with the police. I wasn’t going to take this any further but now that you won’t let this go I am not taking the picture down. How much money do you have in the bank?”

Plaintiff: “I have some.”

Defendant: “I have plenty. I have more money in the bank than you. Do you think I am an idiot. I have put the note up with my solicitor’s advice. I have a right to hang this up because you were stealing.”


	
	The particulars of publication for each of the issues are identified in the Amended Statement of Claim as follows:
	



	
	As to the poster affixed to the window of the shop, this notice was seen, read and understood by persons who knew the plaintiff and recognised her from the photograph, including the three named persons in paragraph 3(ii) of the Amended Statement of Claim and witnesses called at the hearing;
	
	
	As to the conversation in the shop, the words spoken was spoken in the presence and hearing of “a number of shoppers and one of the plaintiff’s staff”.
	



	
	The imputation pleaded as arising from the poster publication is that:
	



	
	The plaintiff is a thief (the matter complained of as a whole).
	



	
	The imputations pleaded to arise from the oral publication are that:
	



	
	The plaintiff is a thief;
	
	
	The plaintiff stole five items from the defendant’s shop.
	



	
	The defendant is described in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the statement of claim as “the operator of a shop known as One Stop Bargains” at 12 Mount Druitt Road, Mount Druitt, a location “less than 500m from the plaintiff’s home”. He is asserted to have published the poster “by affixing it to the window of his shop, where it was visible to anyone passing on the street and was seen and understood by an unknown number of persons” (paragraph 3 of the statement of claim. Three persons who saw it are named. One of these persons, Mr Taimi Pougia, gave evidence about what he saw, which is set out in more detail below.
	


The defences


	
	The defences originally pleaded were:
	



	
	Justification pursuant to s 25 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW); and
	
	
	Honest opinion pursuant to s 31 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW).
	



	
	The defendant also denied that he was the owner or operator of the shop or that he had affixed the poster to the window.
	
	
	There were conflicting documents on this issue, most or all of which appear to have been in the possession of the plaintiff’s solicitors prior to the hearing. One of these was a retail lease was entered into by Ms Taylah Barakat as lessee on 6 March 2016 for use of these premises as a two-dollar shop called “Our Bargain Hut” (Exhibit 9). In addition, there were public records available, such as an ASIC Business Names Extract which described the business at 12 Mount Druitt Road, Mount Druitt as “Our Bargain Hut” and a Ms Taylah Barakat, the defendant’s daughter, as having been an individual business name holder since 24 August 2015 (Exhibit F). However, in paragraph 3 of a statement to police which the plaintiff obtained in the course of criminal charges laid against her, the defendant identified himself as a former owner of the shop and said he was “still an employee” (at paragraph 4). He also said that he printed off the photograph of the plaintiff and that he put this behind the counter “for staff to see so that they would be able to identify her when she came back in” (paragraph 13).
	
	
	As a result of the apparent inconsistency between these documents requiring an amendment to the pleading, the plaintiff sought, and was granted, an adjournment on the first day of the hearing.
	


The plaintiff seeks leave to amend her pleadings


	
	On the first day of the hearing, 17 August 2017, the plaintiff sought leave to amend to bring an alternative pleading that the defendant:
	



	
	Signified his approval of the publication in his statements to the plaintiff on 13 July 2016 and in his police statement dated 2 November 2016;
	
	
	Alternatively, had the authority to remove the poster and did not do so, thereby assuming responsibility for the publication.
	



	
	The defendant could not meet that alternative pleading and the parties agreed that an adjournment was necessary.
	
	
	I granted leave to the plaintiff to amend the pleading, granted leave to the defendant to amend the defence to plead qualified privilege at common law and granted leave to the plaintiff to file a Reply.
	
	
	The granting of an adjournment on the first day of any hearing is not a course to be encouraged. In the District Court, such applications must generally be made to the List Judge, not the trial judge, and it was necessary for me to consult the List Judge as to whether or not I should hear the application or refer it to him.
	
	
	My reasons for hearing and granting the adjournment included the desirability of all issues being dealt with expeditiously in circumstances where, by readjustment of the court’s listed hearings, a gap could be found to enable the adjournment of the hearing. However the principal reason was the likelihood of a refusal to grant leave to amend in a case of this nature in circumstances where there are decisions to the contrary in the New South Wales Court of Appeal, particularly in defamation proceedings (as to which see Dillon v Boland; Dillon v Cush [2012] NSWCA 364; Ainsworth v Burden [2005] NSWCA 174; TCN Channel 9 Pty Ltd v Antoniadis (1998) 44 NSWLR 682; see also the observations of Mr Tobin QC as to the frequency of adjournments on the first day of the trial at p. 49 of Aspects of the Law of Defamation in New South Wales (Law Society of NSW, Sydney 1990), but also in proceedings for damages in tort generally (as to which see Dubois v R & V Bergin Pty Ltd [2011] NSWCA 309). In Photi v Target Australia Pty Ltd [2006] NSWDC 265 at [16], Mr Evatt, one of the most experienced barristers in this field, consented to the addition of a defence of qualified privilege during the hearing on the basis that the appellate courts would be likely to set any judgment aside if consent were not given. Decisions such as Dillon v Boland; Dillon v Cush, where the amendments of particulars of malice made in 2012 were permitted at the second hearing of the plaintiffs’ claim for a slander spoken 7 years beforehand, in 2005, suggest that such a course is a wise one. 
	
	
	In relation to the defence of common law qualified privilege, a Reply has now been filed, pleading that the occasion of privilege was exceeded, or alternatively that the defendant was actuated by malice, in relation to the first matter complained of, by reason of the following:
	



	
	The fact the matter complained of was displayed in a position from which it was visible to passing members of the public;
	
	
	The fact the first matter complained of was not readily visible to persons working in the shop;
	
	
	It is to be inferred from the above that the publication of the first matter complained of was intended to assert to the public at large that the plaintiff was a thief in order to embarrass and humiliate the plaintiff and that that was its dominant purpose;
	
	
	The defendant continued to display the first matter complained of for some weeks even after being made aware of the plaintiff’s adamant denial that she had stolen from the plaintiff’s shop.
	



	
	As to the second matter complained of, the following particulars of malice are provided:
	



	
	The fact the defendant took no steps to restrict the persons to whom the publication was made, even though those persons clearly included members of the public with no interest in the matter under discussion;
	
	
	The manner of the defendant in the course of publication of the second matter complained of;
	
	
	The malice of the defendant in respect of the publication of the first matter complained of.
	



	
	A defence of honest opinion is also pleaded. As counsel for the defendant notes in her submissions, there is no plea in the Reply in defeasance of the defence of honest opinion pursuant to s 31 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW).
	
	
	The following issues arise in relation to damages:
	



	
	The plaintiff seeks aggravated damages and argues that if such damages are awarded, the cap does not apply (Wilson v Bauer Media Pty Ltd [2017] VSC 521);
	
	
	The defendant raises matters in relation to mitigation of damage.
	



	
	The issues in dispute are largely matters of factual evidence. These were difficult to resolve for the following reasons:
	



	
	Neither party complied with the Standard Orders for Hearing by providing a chronology or statement of issues.
	
	
	The parties did not have discovery or seek case management in the Defamation List.
	
	
	The parties chose not to order a transcript and could not agree upon what evidence had been given by certain witnesses. This created problems as there were substantial challenges to the credibility of both the plaintiff and defendant as well as to certain of the witnesses.
	
	
	The application by the plaintiff on the first day of the hearing (17 August 2017) to adjourn the hearing and the repleading of their respective cases by both parties added to the confusion.
	


The circumstances giving rise to these proceedings


	
	The events in question all took place in the shop the plaintiff calls the “one Stop Bargain Shop” and the defendant calls “Our Bargain Hut” (“the shop”), in July 2016. I will first set out the events of 1 July 2016.
	


The plaintiff visits the shop on 1 July 2016


	
	The plaintiff’s evidence was that she lived three to five minutes’ walk away from the shop and that she went there “every day”. On 1 July 2016, accompanied by two of her seven children, she visited the shop to make some purchases.
	
	
	The plaintiff said she recognised the defendant as someone who worked at the shop twice a week. She also knew Taylah Barakat by sight as someone who, she said, worked at the shop about three to four times a week (which tends to confirm that the plaintiff must be a regular shopper in order to make these observations). However, on 1 July 2016 the only person serving was a young man, whom she described as another person who worked at the shop one to two days a week.
	
	
	On 1 July 2016, Jackson Barakat, who is the defendant’s son and the brother of Taylah, was working in the shop by himself. Jackson Barakat, who is 21 years old, gave evidence that he had worked in the shop for about two years. He was paid a wage by his sister, Taylah Barakat, whom he described as the shop owner. He was familiar with the shop’s CCTV system, which consisted of 8 CCTV cameras which could zoom in and out. Recorded footage was retained until the memory filled up (which took about 12 months).
	
	
	All the evidence confirms that neither Ms Barakat nor the defendant were at the shop at the relevant time of the plaintiff’s visit. The only other member of the Barakat family who came to the shop was Jackson Barakat’s grandmother, who can be seen on the CCTV having a 10-second conversation with him at the time the plaintiff was on the shop premises.
	
	
	The plaintiff indicated that she was just doing her shopping in the usual way. Jackson Barakat said that the plaintiff drew his attention because she was acting in a manner that he considered to be suspicious. He observed her standing in front of the lipsticks display picking up and holding lipsticks and then putting her hand in her pocket with something in it. While she was doing this, she was glancing furtively at him. He told the court that on the CCTV “You can see her looking over her left shoulder”. His observations of the plaintiff’s darting glances at him while putting her hands in her pocket made him suspect that she was inserting items (lipsticks from the make-up section) into her pocket and he operated the camera to zoom in and to follow her as she walked around the shop.
	
	
	When the plaintiff came to the counter, she did not purchase any lipsticks, Jackson Barakat claimed, although the plaintiff had been standing in front of a lipstick counter for some time. Instead, she purchased two ice-blocks for the two children who accompanied her. He thought she was in the shop for seven minutes.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s evidence is to the contrary. She said she bought two lollipops for $1.50 each, 2 ice-blocks at 50 cents each and a $4 lipstick, making a total of $8. She had looked at the $8 lipstick before choosing a $4 lipstick. She has since thrown away both the receipt and the lipstick.
	
	
	The plaintiff denied in her oral evidence that she had put anything in her pocket. She was shown her answers to interrogatories (Exhibit 1):
	


“Q. While you were at the Shop on or about 1 July 2016 did you place any lipstick in your pocket?

A. I can’t recall. I initially was looking at a more expensive lipstick for about $8. I then noticed a less expensive lipsticks range. I can’t recall if I put the $8.00 lipstick in my pocket or not. I put the $8.00 lipstick back on the display when I saw a $4.00 lipstick that I liked and ultimately purchased.”


	
	The plaintiff’s evidence contained a number of inconsistencies, of which this is only one.
	


The CCTV footage


	
	The CCTV footage was shown in court to the plaintiff. The images are clear. The plaintiff is seen picking up and holding items in the makeup display. The long, furtive glance when she looks towards Jackson Barakat (which starts at 37 seconds in the first CCTV extract) is clearly demonstrated.
	
	
	I was only generally addressed about the CCTV contents, but I specifically note:
	



	
	The CCTV is incomplete. The first film, which is 3 minutes and 37 seconds, is taken after Jackson Barakat has zoomed in on the plaintiff, after he said he was alerted by her previous behaviour. She is seen looking at items in the make-up section, picking up small cylindrical items which look like lipsticks. She places one in her pocket while giving a very long and furtive stare from 37 – 55 seconds in the direction of Jackson Barakat, whose head can briefly be glimpsed.
	
	
	It is just after this that Jackson Barakat’s grandmother comes in smiling in recognition of him (at 55 seconds), addressing a quick question to him and giving him a hug. She is gone by 1 minute and 5 seconds.
	
	
	The plaintiff continues to pick up items with her right hand while keeping her left hand in her pocket, apparently clutching something or making a fist, until the 3 minutes and 37 seconds break in the film.
	
	
	It is clear from the second film, which is 2 minutes and 8 seconds long, that Jackson Barakat is watching the plaintiff move around the store and zooming in on her. When she is at the ice-blocks section, she takes her left hand out of her pocket at 59 seconds but puts it back in at 1 minute and 20 seconds, where it remains for the rest of the time until she is shown paying at 2 minutes and 8 seconds. Once again, it looks as though an item has been secreted in her pocket.
	
	
	It is not possible to see what was bought on the film, although both the plaintiff’s hands can be seen at this stage. The angle of the camera does not include her hands.
	



	
	Mr Dibb challenged the admissibility of the CCTV as lacking authenticity, being unclear and lacking probative value pursuant to s 135 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).
	


The admissibility of the CCTV footage


	
	CCTV footage is ubiquitous in shop premises, as well as in many public areas. The tender of CCTV evidence is increasingly common in civil cases (QBE Insurance (Australia) Limited v Orcher [2013] NSWCA 478) and in criminal proceedings (Miller v R [2015] NSWCCA 206). It is not footage prepared for the specific purpose of surveillance of a particular individual (as to which, see Justice Young, P.W., “Disclosure of Evidentiary Video Tapes in Personal Injury Litigation” (2001) 75(6) ALJ 353) but for purposes of security or, in the case of shop premises, to obtain evidence of shoplifting and, as such, is generally regarded as reliable evidence. Although its use to detect crime is suggestive of collection of evidence for investigation of a crime, CCTV footage has nevertheless been considered to amount to a business record (Hamilton v State of New South Wales (No 3) [2014] NSWSC 1915). (I note that the same challenges to CCTV authenticity (at [4] ff) and pursuant to s 135 (at [22]) as those made by Mr Dibb in these proceedings were made to the tender of CCTV in Hamilton v State of New South Wales (No 3), and I have adopted the reasoning of Campbell J in relation to both issues.)
	
	
	The Court of Appeal warned, in QBE Insurance (Australia) Limited v Orcher, as I stressed when making my ruling, that judges must exercise the greatest of caution when interpreting CCTV, and that the quality and clarity of the images is important. However, CCTV is not a one-dimensional photograph and the higher level of caution necessary in relation to photographs (as to which see QBE Insurance (Australia) Limited v Orcher at [21] – [24]) needs to be seen in that light. Where judges do interpret what is on CCTV film, the approach to adopt is the same careful analysis as that made by the Court of Appeal in QBE Insurance (Australia) Limited v Orcher at [59] – [77] and [136] – [138].
	
	
	This is not a case where the identity of the plaintiff is challenged, or the film blurry. However this film was put together, and from which cameras (and I received no submissions from Mr Dibb as to this), the plaintiff is shown in sufficiently long periods of time to be engaging of conduct for the film to be regarded as reflecting what was occurring.
	
	
	Mr Dibb sought to challenge the admissibility of the material on the basis that the original CCTV was the best evidence and not the copy made by Mr Jackson Barakat on his phone. He complained that his client had been seeking that CCTV since the proceedings were commenced. The plaintiff did not give any evidence of the CCTV she saw in the store being any different to that which was shown to her on 13 July 2016, or draw attention to any error or discrepancy in the CCTV. The attack was simply made on the “best evidence” basis and on the basis that exculpatory material may have therefore not been included.
	
	
	The evidence in this case was that the CCTV was given to the police and formed part of the police brief in criminal proceedings against the plaintiff which were dropped on the day of hearing. The CCTV tendered by the defendant was recorded by Jackson Barakat on his phone from the CCTV screen. I was not told if the CCTV the police took was the one tendered or, if the criminal proceedings went as far as the hearing, whether the police CCTV was given to the plaintiff, or her lawyers at any time.
	
	
	If the tendered CCTV is different, I noted that it sometimes occurs that CCTV film is lost or unavailable and that, in those circumstances, secondary evidence of CCTV film may be given, for the reasons explained in Wade v R (2014) 41 VR 13. In the present case, there are compelling reasons for doing so, as Jackson Barakat actually saw the plaintiff performing the acts shown on the CCTV, made a recording that day and showed it to his sister and the defendant, and provided either the original CCTV or a copy from his phone (it was unclear which) to the police on the following day. As noted in Wade v R, his personal observation and role in the creation of the CCTV are of relevance in accepting it into evidence.
	
	
	Accordingly, for these reasons, the CCTV footage copied by Jackson Barakat onto his phone is admissible.
	


The CCTV is copied and shown


	
	After the plaintiff left the premises, Jackson Barakat immediately checked the CCTV footage. He saw the plaintiff appearing to put items in her pocket from the shelves in the makeup display. He telephoned his sister Taylah, who told him to make a copy of the footage on his phone. He had to record it in two parts because his phone battery was used up and his phone stopped recording.
	
	
	Jackson Barakat also reported the matter to the police, whom he said came the next day and “took the footage”. He did not know who the plaintiff was when the police came. He did not hear from the police again and he did not know until afterwards that the plaintiff had come into the store about two weeks later and denied stealing anything.
	
	
	None of this evidence was challenged, including Jackson’s statement that the police came to the shop the following day and he showed them the CCTV. In particular, there was no challenge to the defendant or his children that evidence they did not know who the plaintiff was. Nor was there any challenge to Taylah Barakat’s description of being told about these events and shown the footage her brother copied onto his phone from the CCTV.
	
	
	Taylah Barakat did a stocktake the next day and noticed, when she checked the lipstick inventory against the shelves, that there were items missing. She was not cross-examined about making this discovery, although it was put to her that “shrinkage” of this kind was inevitable.
	
	
	Jackson and Taylah Barakat both asked their father, the defendant (who told the court his name was in fact Tony Elwedde and not Tony Barakat, but nothing turns on this) what to do. The defendant said that he told them to copy the CCTV and subsequently looked at the recorded footage on his daughter’s phone. When he looked at the footage, the defendant was satisfied that the person he was observing had stolen some lipsticks by putting them in her pocket, and said so. He said his daughter asked him what to do and he said he told her to ask the lady not to come back into the shop.
	


Who prepared the poster?


	
	Contrary to what appears in his own police statement, the defendant said he was not able to take a still photograph from the footage on the phone as he was “old school” and not very good with computers or CCTVs. He played no part, he said, in printing off any portion of the phone to create the poster, which is the first matter complained of. The evidence of Taylah Barakat is that she did this, and that the handwriting on the poster was hers, which she demonstrated by writing the word “THIEF!” on a sheet of paper.
	
	
	The first question is what to make of the defendant’s statement to police that he saw the plaintiff stealing, he prepared the poster and that he, not his daughter, was responsible for this poster being in the shop.
	
	
	The defendant provided a statement to the police on 2 November 2016, The relevant portions are as follows:
	


“1. This statement made by me accurately sets out the evidence that I would be prepared, if necessary, to give in court as a witness. The statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief and I make it knowing that, if it is tendered in evidence, I will be liable to prosecution if I have wilfully stated in it anything that I know to be false, or do not believe to be true.

2. I am 46 years of age.

3. I am currently the owner of a retail store “Our Bargain Hut” located at shop 12a Mount Druitt Road, Mt Druitt. My daughter recently became the owner of the store about 2-3 months ago.

4. I am still an employee at the store, stocking shelves and assisting with sales.

5. On Friday the 15th of July 2016, I was working in the store attending to my duties. About 11:00am that day, I noticed a woman in the store with kids; I think there were about 2 of them. She was hanging around the makeup section. She was a large islander female, medium height, her hair was tied back and she had a big coat on. I recognised her because she was a regular customer.

6. I noticed that she was there for quite a while, maybe 7 to 8 minutes. She kept looking over her should towards me and my son. My son was standing near the register which is at the front of the shop.

7. I saw the female holding something from the makeup section then she moved her hand down and placed it in her pocket. She kept that hand there inside the pocket and looked around and stared at me and my son.

8. She then started looking at things with her other hand. I noticed her again with the opposite hand place something in her other coat pocket and continued shopping.

9. The two children with her came to her and lead her to the freezer section. I watched the kids grab an item each and walk towards the register.

10. The lady paid my son for the items and then left the store. The total cost for the items is about $20 to $25 dollars.

11. About closing time, around 5:15pm, my son and I reviewed the stores CCTV system and watched footage of the female in the store.

12. I again saw the lady stealing make up and placing it in her coat.

13. The next week I printed off an image of the lady and placed it behind the counter for staff to see so that they would be able to identify her when she came back in.


	
	This is untrue. It was Jackson Barakat who was in the store and the defendant never saw the plaintiff. Nor did he, according to his evidence, print off the photograph and make the poster. Nor was he the owner or operator of the store, according to the documentary evidence tendered.
	
	
	For the reasons set out in more detail below, I accept that this poster was created by Taylah Barakat and not by the defendant. She owned the shop and showed her knowledgeability concerning the lease contents, the business and day to day shop activities. She said she wrote the word “THIEF!” in her own handwriting and wrote the word again on a piece of paper. While judges must be cautious about making assumptions as to handwriting without the benefit of expert evidence (Angel v Hawkesbury City Council [2008] NSWCA 130; Blacktown City Council v Hocking (2008) Aust Torts Reports ¶81-956), the similarities between her handwriting (Exhibit 10) and the writing at the top and bottom of the poster are strong.
	
	
	The next question is where the poster Ms Barakat prepared was kept.
	


Where was the poster put?


	
	Ms Barakat’s evidence, and that of the other witnesses for the defence, is that she never put it on the window and never saw it on the window. The poster remained behind the counter where it was visible to staff and persons attending the counter, for the period up until 13 July 2016.
	
	
	Was the poster visible from the street? The plan of the shop which was tendered and the photograph of the premises (Exhibit 5 and Exhibit E) showed clearly that the counter is an L-shaped desk which is directly beside the window at the front of the shop. Everything is glass. However, there is no evidence that the poster, if it was behind the counter, could be seen from the street.
	
	
	It is unclear how many customers came and went in the shop between the period when the poster was put up (which the plaintiff asserts in the Amended Statement of Claim occurred on 6 July 2016, but which could have gone up a day or two earlier on the defendant’s account) until the plaintiff’s visit on 13 July 2016.
	
	
	Given the regularity with which the plaintiff and her family visited the shopping centre (on a daily basis, according to her evidence), it is more likely than not that the plaintiff and members of her family were not merely walking past the shop but going into it. In the case of the plaintiff, she said in her evidence that she attended the shop “every day”.
	
	
	While Mr Dibb sought to argue in his oral submissions that this was in fact a reference to “the shops”, I am satisfied that the plaintiff and her family members were such regular attenders at the shop premises that at least one, or indeed all of them, must have attended these premises at least one or two times in the intervening week to ten days before the plaintiff’s visit on 13 July 2016. In addition, if they were visiting other shops, it is likely that they would have walked past this shop, as Mr Pougia and Mr Fou Vaa said they did on the way home from work. If this poster was on the window visible for all to see, it would have been difficult to miss.
	
	
	One of the principal difficulties for the plaintiff in this case is that if the poster in question was in fact in the shop window in a visible location, it is impossible to explain how she and the members of her family who gave evidence on her behalf never noticed this publication over this period. The question of where this publication was affixed, rather than its contents, is the central issue concerning publication.
	


The events of 13 July 2016


	
	The poster came to the attention of the plaintiff when she received a text message from Lena Olamoe, whom she identified as “a friend” but who was later described as her sister-in-law. The plaintiff said that she received a text message on 13 July 2016 from this person saying there was a photograph of her “on the shop window”. She conceded in cross-examination, however, that this text message does not use the word “window” but says in the Samoan language that the photograph was “at the front of the shop”.
	
	
	A photograph of the front of the shop (taken from the inside) was tendered. The whole shop front is glass, and the shop counter (where the defendant’s witnesses and Mr Pougia say the poster was) is right beside the glass front windows and glass front door. Given the location of the counter at the front of the shop, the description of the poster being “at the front of the shop” is more consistent with the version of events given by the defendant’s witnesses than that given by the plaintiff and her witnesses.
	
	
	The plaintiff went to the shop at about 11:45am on 13 July 2016. The person who was serving behind the counter on that occasion was the defendant. They had a conversation (asserted to be the second matter complained of) and she was shown the CCTV footage. The plaintiff then went outside while she attempted to call the police. She remained there, according to her evidence, until approximately 2:00pm that day.
	
	
	Taylah Barakat was in the shop on the occasion of the plaintiff’s visit, but said she was working in another part of the premises and did not come over to take part in the conversation between the defendant and the plaintiff on any version of the events in question. No version of the conversation given by the plaintiff suggests that she made any contribution to it. The evidence of the defendant and Ms Barakat is that she came over to set up the CCTV when called by the defendant, as he wanted to play the CCTV but did not know how to do this.
	
	
	There is a dispute about whether the first matter complained of was taken down at the end of that conversation (the oral evidence of the defendant and Ms Barakat), or at some later time (the evidence of the defendant in his police statement). The only witness for the plaintiff giving evidence about the sign being there for any length of time is Mr Fou Vaa, who said the poster was there for “a few weeks”, but in such general terms that his evidence is of little assistance.
	
	
	Whilst the plaintiff was in the shop talking to the defendant, the plaintiff’s brother, Mr Pougia, came into the shop but did not participate in any of the activities or hear the words of the matter complained of. He did, however, give evidence of seeing the first matter complained of during his visit to the shop. He saw it on the plywood wall inside the shop behind the shop counter and not on the window as claimed by the plaintiff.
	
	
	The plaintiff told the court that she telephoned her solicitor that day. Whether she telephoned her solicitor on the same day or the following day, the solicitor for the plaintiff, Mr Neil Kirby, gave evidence about a conversation he had with the defendant, which is discussed in more detail below.
	


Other family members see the poster on 13 July


	
	The plaintiff said she made several telephone calls to the police to ask them to attend and waited at the shop until approximately 2:00pm. She then went home and went to her room, too distressed to speak to her children, when they came home from school or work.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s daughter, Melinda Vaa, came home between 3:00 and 4:00pm that day. She spoke to her uncle, Mr Pougia, who told her that her mother was in her room but he did not refer to the incident at the shop despite having just been there himself.
	
	
	Melinda took her younger sister to the shop to make some food purchases and while she was there she saw the first matter complained of “in the window”.
	
	
	At an unknown time but apparently after Melinda’s visit, the plaintiff’s son, Mr Fou Vaa, walked past the window of the shop on the way home from work. I infer from his evidence that he routinely walked past the shop in this fashion as part of his trip home. He saw the first matter complained of on the window of the shop, according to his evidence, but was uncertain of the date.
	
	
	Another son of the plaintiff, Sakaro Vaa, also went to the shop and saw the poster in the window of the shop. This is described in the chronology provided with closing submissions as occurring “on or shortly after 13 July 2016” but Mr Sakaro Vaa was unable to identify the date. It is more likely than not that he saw it on 13 July 2016, because he described going home to speak to his mother who said she had already seen the poster.
	


The solicitor’s call to the defendant


	
	The plaintiff’s case is that the defendant admitted, both to the plaintiff and to Mr Kirby, that the shop was under his control, which is consistent with his statement dated 2 November 2016. Mr Kirby was called to give this evidence.
	
	
	Mr Kirby appears not to have been cognizant of the possibility that he would be giving evidence, in that he sat in court and did not disclose that he would be a potential witness until the second day of the hearing. He was doubly disadvantaged being called at such short notice, in that he acknowledged he had made no telephone note of the conversation he had with the defendant on or about 14 July 2016.
	
	
	Mr Kirby’s evidence was that he identified himself on the telephone to the defendant as the plaintiff’s solicitor and said he was calling in relation to a photograph of the plaintiff in the window of the shop. He said that the defendant admitted to putting the notice in the window and to being the owner and said “Do you think I am an idiot? I have spoken to my lawyer and I am allowed to put it there. The footage is clear”. Mr Kirby replied that it would be in the defendant’s interests to take it down. The conversation became heated and the defendant told Mr Kirby to “put it in writing”, or words to that effect.
	
	
	Mr Kirby was not a convincing witness. He only generally recalled the conversation as occurring “around 12 or 13 July”. He thought he prepared a concerns notice or some other form of letter to the defendant, but was unable to recall if the letter had been sent. He acknowledged in cross-examination he had only known he would give evidence “this morning” and his demeanour in the witness box was that of a person struggling to remember what was said.
	
	
	Mr Kirby gave his evidence after the defendant. Ms Chrysanthou submitted that this was a relevant factor to take into account when determining the weight to put on Mr Kirby’s evidence.
	
	
	Although Mr Kirby said he had “a strong recollection of a conversation because of the nature of it” and that he “couldn’t believe” how the defendant had ignored his “simple request” to take the poster down, his inability to recollect whether or not he sent a letter of demand or the precise date of the conversation, and the absence of contemporary notes, means that I place little weight upon his recollection of the events in question.
	


Publication


	
	The plaintiff must demonstrate that each of the matters complained of was published as pleaded and to a third party.
	


Publication of the first matter complained of


	
	The plaintiff’s case on publication in relation to the first matter complained of changed when it became apparent that Taylah Barakat was indeed the owner of the premises and had put up the notice in question. The amendment in question takes into account the broad definition of publication in Webb v Bloch (1928) 41 CLR 331 for those who are in any degree accessory to publication, including by lending assistance to the existence of the publication or “by any means whatever conduce to the publication” (at 364), such as suggesting the course of conduct or otherwise endorsing it, or refusal to take down the matter complained of. I have considered both bases of liability, although the plaintiff’s submissions are principally aimed at the amended ground of publication, in that documentary evidence confirms that Taylah Barakat, not the defendant, is the leaseholder and operator of the shop and the evidence clearly points to her creating and putting up the poster.
	


Publication of the second matter complained of


	
	In relation to the second publication, the plaintiff must establish that the defendant spoke either the words complained of or some reasonably similar version (see the reference to “fatal variance” in R. Parkes QC, A. Mullis, G. Busuttil, A. Speker & A. Scot, Gatley on Libel and Slander (Sweet & Maxwell, United Kingdom, 12th ed. (“Gatley”)) at [32.15]). It must also be demonstrated that the conversation in question was heard by a third person.
	
	
	The defendant challenges whether the second matter complained of was published as pleaded or heard by a third party.
	


Matters incidental to publication


	
	The capacity and defamatory meaning of the imputations is not in dispute. Nor, in relation to the first matter complained of, is the issue of identification.
	


The credit of the witnesses


	
	The contested issue of fact between the parties on publication included a strong attack in relation to the credit of the plaintiff and the defendant (and, in the case of the defendant, to the plaintiff’s witnesses).
	
	
	In McGlen-McLeod v Galloway [2012] NSWCA 368 Tobias A-JA cited with approval the observations of Tugendhat J in Thornton v Telegraph Media Group Ltd [2011] EWHC 1884 (QB) at [73]–[74] concerning findings of credit of witnesses:
	


““[73] There is great assistance to be obtained from extra-judicial writing of Lord Bingham in a chapter headed “The Judge as Juror: The Judicial Determination of Factual Issues” … Lord Bingham cited Sir Richard Eggleston QC Evidence, Proof and Probability (1978), 155 who set out the main tests to be used by a judge to determine whether a witness is lying or not:

(1) the consistency of the witness’s evidence with what is agreed, or clearly shown by other evidence, to have occurred;

(2) the internal consistency of the witness’s evidence;

(3) consistency with what the witness has said or deposed on other occasions;

(4) the credit of the witness in relation to matters not germane to the litigation;

(5) the demeanour of the witness.

[74] Lord Bingham then added these observations:

“In choosing between witnesses on the basis of probability, a judge must of course bear in mind that the improbable account may nonetheless be the true one. The improbable is, by definition, as I think Lord Devlin once observed, that which may happen, and obvious injustice could result if a story told in evidence were too readily rejected simply because it was bizarre, surprising or unprecedented … so long as there is any realistic chance of a witness being honestly mistaken rather than deliberately dishonest a judge will no doubt hold him to be so, not so much out of charity as out of a cautious reluctance to brand anyone a liar (and perjurer) unless he is plainly shown to be such.””


	
	The defendant’s statement to police is full of statements which must have been known by him to be false. I have set out my reasons for considering that he lied to the police but I have had regard to the nature of those lies in the manner considered appropriate in the decisions discussed in Marsden v Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd [2001] NSWSC 510. I do not regard him as a reliable or honest witness. However, I do not consider he is lying about saying that the plaintiff was stealing when he knew she was not. His were lies to protect his family.
	
	
	This can also be seen in relation to his version of the conversation he had with the plaintiff, which is set out in his statement to police as follows:
	


“14. About a week later, the same woman came back into the store and approached me.

She said: “You have a photo of me on your window?”

I said: “Are you the lady in that picture?”

She said: “Yes.”

I said: “Well you were here on Friday and we have you on camera stealing.”

15. The lady denied stealing the makeup. I showed her the CCTV footage and she said “That’s not me”.

16. In the weeks that followed, there were other people I believe to be relatives of the lady. They kept on coming into the store and threatening me and other employees to take the photo of her down.

17. I spoke to the lady again and agreed to take the photo down if she and her family stop coming into the store, to which she agreed.”


	
	This is not an accurate version of what was said, but it does not “verbal” the plaintiff, or assert she made admissions of guilt.
	
	
	The defendant’s lies in his police statement must detract substantially from his credit. His explanation that he was worried for the health of his wife, who was having a difficult pregnancy, is implausible.
	
	
	The nature of his lies is, however, revealing, and should be considered in light of the many judicial observations as to the interpretation of lies by witnesses discussed in Marsden v Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd, where Mr Marsden gave a false name to police to avoid being arrested for homosexual conduct, an offence at the time, where a conviction would have destroyed his legal career.
	
	
	In the present case, the defendant claimed in the witness statement to be the owner of the shop, to have seen the plaintiff stealing and to have made the poster when his children had in fact carried out these steps. At that time, he had already been sued for defamation.
	
	
	The defendant did not make up fresh evidence against the plaintiff, but gave the evidence in his statement that his children should have. The most likely explanation is that he sought to protect his children from being sued for defamation as well. That is conduct which must very substantially damage his credit, but, contrary to Mr Dibb’s submissions, it does not amount to making up evidence to convict the plaintiff when she was innocent.
	
	
	The first difficulty for the plaintiff (and, for that matter, all of her family members) is the unlikelihood that she and her family walked past or into this shop on a daily basis without ever noticing a poster with her photograph and the word “thief” prominently displayed to all passers-by through the glass panelling. The second is that, as Ms Chrysanthou points out in her written submissions (at paragraph 20) the plaintiff’s evidence is inconsistent with contemporaneous evidence (such as the CCTV and her sister-in-law’s text message), her answers to interrogatories and the form and content of both the matters complained of.
	
	
	The particular difficulties with her evidence are as follows:
	



	
	There is nothing on “Exhibit A” indicative of it being affixed to anything, let alone the inside front window of the shop, and the explanation for the cropped photograph attached to the matter complained of, which masks the top of the photograph in a way that prevents the lack of Sellotape or Bluetack being evident.
	
	
	Her answers to interrogatories and evidence concerning her sister-in-law’s text message were inconsistent with what was acknowledged to be the correct translation, namely that there was no reference to the photograph being in the “window” and the reference to it being at the front of the shop was, if anything, supportive of the defendant’s version of where this poster was located.
	
	
	Her answers to interrogatories (Exhibit 1) and conduct as seen on the CCTV are inconsistent with her denial in the witness box that she had not put anything in her pocket. In cross-examination she admitted that there was no honest reason for her to have placed an item such as a lipstick in her pocket.
	
	
	Her description of looking at Jackson Barakat because of his conversation with his grandmother is inconsistent with what is seen on the CCTV; she is looking at him from 37 second onwards whereas the grandmother does not come into the picture until 55 seconds. Mr Dibb’s subsequent explanation that she was looking at her children is also not borne out by the CCTV.
	
	
	When faced with inconsistencies in her evidence, she said she could not remember. For example, when asked how she could have failed to notice the poster in the window in the week to ten days prior to her sister-in-law contacting her, she said she could not remember if she had attended the shop over this period, although she said in evidence in chief that she effectively shopped there daily.
	



	
	I am satisfied, in relation to both the plaintiff and defendant, that I should not rely upon any part of their respective evidence unless it was corroborated by a witness of credit. In the case of the plaintiff, this creates real difficulties, because the evidence of Mr Pougia, the only witness she called whom I regard as a witness of credit, contradicted her evidence. The evidence of the plaintiff’s children concerning the manner in which the notice was asserted to be fixed to the window was so inconsistent that I can give it little or no weight.
	
	
	As noted above, the plaintiff’s solicitor, Mr Kirby, was called at very short notice, in circumstances where he did not have a file note and could not remember essential information such as the date of the call or whether he had sent a letter of demand. His general recollection of events appeared sketchy and his evidence is of little assistance.
	
	
	While the defendant is not a witness whose evidence I would accept without corroboration, Taylah Barakat and Jackson Barakat are, I consider, witnesses of truth. As noted above, Taylah Barakat’s careful and detailed answers to questions about how she ran the shop satisfied me she is in fact in charge of the shop, as the lease documents and ASIC documents confirm. Jackson Barakat’s evidence was challenged in the most cursory fashion and no submission is made that he is not a witness of truth.
	
	
	I next set out a consideration of the evidence in relation to the disputed issues concerning publication and the defences.
	


Publication


	
	Each of the publications must be considered separately.
	


The first publication


	
	The Amended Statement of Claim describes the poster as having been affixed by the defendant “inside the window of his shop, where it was visible to anyone passing on the street” (paragraph 3). Annexure A to the Amended Statement of Claim shows a photograph which appears to be behind glass; there is a reflection of what appears to be the opposite side of the street, including trees. There is also a shadow of indeterminate nature behind the poster. The whole of the poster is not shown; the top left hand corner is cut off and the bottom right hand corner is not tethered to the window but appears to be flapping away slightly. The top right hand corner is also obscured.
	
	
	The plaintiff produced another copy of the poster to the court (Exhibit A). It looks as though it is the same photograph, in that the material at the bottom looks the same; if it is not the same photograph it was certainly taken at the same time. The portion at the top which is obscured is now visible, but the left hand side of the poster is still cut off.
	
	
	Both photographs show the poster on the inside of the shop window, facing outwards. In neither photograph is there any indication of the method of affixing the poster to the glass behind which it is shown. The manner in which the poster is curled away on the bottom left hand side in both photographs suggests that any form of affixing of the photograph to the window would have to be rudimentary. There is no evidence of any line of Sellotape in the window, or any other form of adhesive.
	
	
	In addition, there is no photograph of the shop window from a distance showing where this poster was attached. The logical manner in which to take a photograph of the poster would be to take a picture of the front of the shop showing where the poster was located.
	
	
	The defendant’s position is that given that the whole of the poster is not displayed in either of the photographs, and there is no photograph of the shop window from a distance, it can be surmised that a person is holding the poster up to the window for the purpose of the photograph being taken. It is submitted that the poster could have been momentarily grabbed and held up to the window. The plaintiff’s evidence was that she took the photograph of the poster.
	
	
	It was put to the plaintiff by Ms Chrysanthou that the photograph tendered was not the photograph that the plaintiff had in fact taken. The plaintiff replied, “whatever photo is in my phone is the one I took”. It was also put to her that someone was holding the poster up for the purpose of the photograph, and she did not accept that proposition.
	
	
	The plaintiff was cross-examined about the contents of the text message she received from her sister-in-law. She conceded in cross-examination that the text message did not say “window” and that it said “at the front” of the store.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s solicitor, Mr Kirby, gave evidence of telephoning the defendant and of the defendant admitting to him to being the owner and to putting the poster in the window. For reasons set out elsewhere, I am reluctant to accept this evidence.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s daughter, Melinda Vaa, gave evidence that she saw the poster in the window and that it was held up with four short pieces of tape. The plaintiff’s son, Fou Vaa, gave evidence that he saw the poster in the window but was unable to say how it was affixed. The plaintiff’s son, Sakaro Vaa, also said that the poster was in the window and that it was affixed with one piece of tape.
	
	
	Mr Dibb relies upon what is called “a revealing slip” in the defendant’s evidence when the plaintiff says that “it was her picture in the window”. I note that he said this in his police statement as well (Exhibit D, paragraph 14).
	
	
	However, I regard all of the defendant’s evidence as unreliable, including these parts. Even if I were to construe this part of his evidence against him, it is not “a revealing slip” but a description of what the plaintiff said.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the handwriting in question was that of Taylah Barakat. Her evidence was that she created the poster, wrote the words (see Exhibit 10) and put the poster behind the counter of her own volition. She said she also created another document with just the photograph of the plaintiff and put it on the wall behind the register. The defendant and Mr Pougia both described seeing this photograph behind the register in their evidence.
	
	
	The evidence of Taylah Barakat and Jackson Barakat that the poster was behind the counter is supported by the evidence of Mr Pougia, the plaintiff’s brother, and by the contents of the plaintiff’s sister-in-law’s text message, which set out that the poster was “at the front of the shop”.
	
	
	Ms Chrysanthou asks me to draw a Jones v Dunkel inference (Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298) from the plaintiff’s failure to call her sister-in-law.
	
	
	As the person who saw the matter complained of and alerted the plaintiff, and who sent the plaintiff a text message saying where the poster was, the plaintiff’s sister-in-law’s evidence was relevant to the contested issue of publication in this case. As the plaintiff’s sister-in-law, and as someone who had been sufficiently motivated to send a text message to the plaintiff, the plaintiff’s sister-in-law was clearly a witness who would be found in the plaintiff’s camp. In the circumstances, I draw an inference that her evidence, if given, would not have assisted the plaintiff.
	
	
	I am satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the poster was indeed at the front of the shop, namely at the counter directly in front of the glass windows, most probably in the spot marked on Exhibit 4.
	


Was the defendant the owner of the shop?


	
	I am satisfied that the poster was not placed on the window as claimed. However, I must also set out my findings of fact in relation to whether the defendant was in fact the owner of the shop or in some other ways authorised the putting up of the poster. The material relied upon by Mr Dibb is set out below.
	
	
	During the hearing Mr Dibb provided a statement of issues on publication in which he identified the issues going to the defendant’s liability as being:
	



	
	Whether he posted it on the window of the shop or directed someone else to do it, or otherwise agreed to it being removed from the shop;
	
	
	Whether he failed to remove it from the window of the shop “when he could have done so in circumstances that indicate he assumed responsibility for its continued display”. I interpret this to mean his refusal to take it down when the plaintiff came into the shop.
	



	
	Although not included in the statement of issues, Mr Dibb made a submission that the plaintiff was liable for publication on the basis that he subsequently signified his approval of the poster by his statements to police.
	
	
	I shall deal with each of these in turn.
	
	
	As to whether the defendant was in fact the owner of the shop, Mr Dibb points to the following evidence. The defendant, who owns several discount or “two dollar shops”, has always owned the “One Stop Bargains” name. It would appear from the Facebook page that these shops traded at a number of addresses at various times, including two shops in the ShopSmart Centre, another in Elmerton and this shop itself. Mr Dibb submits that as there is no distinction made between these various branches of the shop on the shop’s Facebook page, I should assume that they all are owned by the defendant.
	
	
	Exhibit 9, the real estate lease, is however to the contrary. It is a retail lease in favour of premises described as “Our Bargain Hut”, not “One Stop Bargains”. Just as importantly, it is dated 6 March 2016, which is well before the events the subject of this litigation.
	
	
	Mr Dibb also submitted that I should not accept the evidence of Taylah Barakat as being the owner, because of the vagueness of her evidence. It is submitted, for example, she was “vague about the rent”, although her evidence clearly identified the correct sum of rent at the beginning of the rental lease as being $530. It was also put that she was wrong about the lease in believing it to be three years, when the lease tendered was only one. However, that lease terminated on 6 March 2017 and the shop is still operating from the same premises. Ms Barakat’s evidence needs to be seen in this context.
	
	
	As I have noted elsewhere, Ms Barakat gave evidence confidently about turnover, supplies, ordering and selling, stocktaking and shrinkage. She was an impressive witness who made no errors on these topics. I am satisfied that she was the owner of the shop.
	
	
	Mr Dibb also relies upon the fact that Taylah Barakat and Jackson Barakat both asked the defendant what to do. Given that Ms Barakat and her brother were at 20 and 21 years respectively and Ms Barakat said she started her working life working for her father, I consider this to be understandable in terms of family dynamics rather than proof of ownership. Their evidence was not that the defendant told them to put up a poster, but that he told them to stop the plaintiff coming back into the shop. The poster was then created by Taylah Barakat for this purpose.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the putting up of a poster was Ms Barakat’s idea, that she did so and that she did so in the context of being the person in charge of the store.
	


The alternative Webb v Bloch argument


	
	Mr Dibb also relies upon the principles set out in Urbanchich v Drummoyne Municipal Council (1988) A Def R 50-035 and Byrne v Deane [1937] 1 KB 818 to submit that the defendant failed or refused to remove the poster in circumstances in which he assumed responsibility for its publication.
	
	
	There are considerable difficulties of law in terms of the liability of third parties for material published by other persons even where that is done with the knowledge or consent of the third party involved. In Cao v Liu [2013] NSWDC 172 the defendant claimed not to know anything about how emails worked, but was aware her husband had set up an email account in her own name, and had taken no steps to prevent him from doing so. This was insufficient to amount to liability when her husband used the email account in her name to publish defamatory material.
	
	
	The principles for liability set out in Urbanchich v Drummoyne Municipal Council were recently considered by the Full Court of the South Australian Supreme Court in Google Inc v Duffy [2017] SASCFC 130 at [131] where the court noted the formulation for liability in accordance with the principles in Urbanchich v Drummoyne Municipal Council requires that there be a failure to take advantage of an opportunity to remove defamatory material where that failure shows consent, approval, adoption or promotion of the presence of that statement on the defendant’s property. It is approval of the presence of the material, not its message, that is required. The question is, however, one of what amounts to reasonably practicable steps (at [134]).
	
	
	What Mr Dibb submits a defendant must do is to respond instantly and uncritically to the plaintiff’s complaint. This is a great deal to expect from a person who is not the original publisher, in circumstances where it would be reasonable for him to raise this with the publisher first (it should be recalled that the matter complained of in Urbanchich v Drummoyne Municipal Council was anonymous graffiti, and the decision may accordingly be distinguished).
	
	
	What the defendant in fact did was consistent with his obligations, in that he showed the plaintiff the CCTV and asked for her comments. When she said she was going to call the police, he waited while she called the police, who did not come. He later responded to a phone call from the solicitor for the plaintiff by telling that solicitor to put this in writing.
	
	
	Whether or not my finding as to publication in the window is accurately reflected on the evidence, these responses of the defendant were entirely reasonable in the circumstances. Whether or not he was the owner, it was entirely proper for him to wait until the police and/or the plaintiff’s solicitor set out the issues so that the appropriate steps could be taken. He was not obliged to rip down the poster immediately in the manner suggested by Mr Dibb. Accordingly, if my findings in relation to where the poster was affixed, and the identity of the owner of the shop, are individually or collectively wrong, the defendant would still not be liable under Webb v Bloch principles.
	
	
	I remain troubled by the apparent admission of liability in the defendant’s statement to police, which Ms Chrysanthou submits is “incorrect as a matter of law” (written submissions, paragraph 63), although without setting out why. If a person assumes liability for the purpose of protecting a third party (such as a family member), it is difficult to see how that does not amount to an assumption of liability for the publication in question. I was not, however, addressed as to authority on this issue by either party (beyond Ms Chrysanthou’s statement that the law was to the contrary).
	
	
	If a person accepts liability for a publication in a police statement, in circumstances where the limitation period then elapses without the correct person being joined, it is hard to see why that person should be allowed to withdraw that admission. If the poster had been attached to the shop window as claimed, the defendant’s admission of placing it there, for the purpose of protecting the true publisher from liability up until the trial, is one which he should not be entitled to withdraw.
	


The second publication


	
	The plaintiff’s version in her evidence in chief was that after she received a text message she went straight to the shop where she saw a male person and a lady. It was the man she spoke to. She asked about the poster (although not identifying precisely where she had seen it). She claimed that the defendant said, “That wasn’t you darling, I know you well”. The plaintiff said she replied, “That’s me, that’s my photo in the window” and asked him to take it down. She said the defendant replied, “I can’t take it down because someone stole from the shop”.
	
	
	The plaintiff said she spent “about half an hour” talking to the defendant and was not able to set out “everything that was said”. She kept asking him to take it down and he said he could not because he has authority from his lawyer to hang the photo up. She said that he went through his “computer” to find the “photograph”. She thought there were two other shoppers in the shop “when he went through [the CCTV]” and said “he showed me everything in the computer”. He told her “whatever it says in here says it all”. He said that the way she was stealing the makeup “was clear as day”. She was “pretty sure” the two shoppers who were standing there heard this portion of the conversation as well. The plaintiff then said, “I am going to the police”, to which the defendant replied, “Go outside and ring the police because you’re disturbing the customers”. She went outside and telephoned the police. She was sitting on a seat nearby. She tried to contact the police “so many times” and then spent “a few hours” waiting for the police. She thought she was there for two to three hours. She also took a photo of the poster. She was asked where it was displayed and she said “up on the front of the window of the shop” indicating it was “on the left”. She said she took the photograph “from outside”. She said that the photograph was “above eye level”.
	
	
	The plaintiff was told that the police would be there “shortly”, but after waiting three hours outside the shop when the police had not arrived, she went home.
	
	
	The plaintiff said that later that afternoon she spoke to her sister-in-law. She also mentioned her daughter, Melinda, her son and her brother, but it was unclear whether she was claiming to have spoken to them that day about the matter complained of. The plaintiff’s evidence on these issues was at times discursive and hard to follow.
	
	
	I have drawn this summary from my own notes. Neither counsel summarised the plaintiff’s evidence in chief of the second matter complained of. Mr Dibb’s submissions (at paragraph 54) merely stated:
	


“The Plaintiff gave evidence of this conversation. The Defendant gave evidence that was different from the Plaintiff’s version.”

Was Taylah Barakat present?


	
	Mr Dibb went on to add that (paragraph 55, written submissions):
	


“Extraordinarily, the Defendant’s daughter, Taylah Barakat, gave no evidence of this conversation at all, despite the fact that she was there. The Defendant says he asked Taylah to play the video footage, so (assuming that even this is not an invention) she was clearly involved. She must have known what it was all about because she took the Notice and screwed it up and threw it away. It had been put to the Plaintiff in cross-examination that she was making so much fuss and noise that she had to be asked to leave the shop. Had that been true, Taylah Barakat could not have been unaware of it. Nevertheless, Ms Barakat’s evidence about this conversation ran to saying: “They were talking. I didn’t pay any attention.””


	
	Taylah Barakat was present in the shop when the plaintiff came in, according to the plaintiff’s evidence, but the plaintiff’s evidence was that the defendant was, at all relevant times, the person she spoke to, who discussed the footage and who played it for her on his computer.
	
	
	In cross-examination, it was put to the plaintiff that she had a poor recollection of the events in question and in particular of this conversation. She had difficulty recollecting what was said and said as much in her answers. This applies not only to this conversation but generally. I am satisfied that Taylah Barakat was not present during the conversation prior to or after the CCTV footage was shown and that her presence during the CCTV portion was to set up the film only.
	
	
	Taylah Barakat says that she was out of earshot in another part of the shop until called over by her father to help with playing the CCTV, which was after the conversation in question. She had to locate the tape and play it. She played no part in the subsequent conversation and her whereabouts are unknown. She was not asked what part of the conversation she heard while the tape was playing.
	
	
	If the plaintiff sought to prove that Ms Barakat was there, the onus lay on the plaintiff to put it to her that she was present during the period of time that the oral publication took place. It was not put to her that she heard her father say words to the effect that the plaintiff was a thief or that the plaintiff had stolen five items from the shop. The only part she was asked about was whether she heard her father say he had his solicitor’s authorisation of the poster, which she denied hearing.
	


What was said?


	
	The version that is put to the plaintiff in cross-examination was that when she initially raised the issue with the defendant, he said, “That’s not you?”, to which she replied, “Yes it is”, and the defendant said, “how did you even see that photo?”, to which the plaintiff replied, “Never mind, I’ve seen it”. The defendant then said “We’ve got footage of you” and played it. The plaintiff said the footage he played was “the one we saw [in court]” and not a different footage, to which the plaintiff said, “that’s not me”. The defendant replied, “Five minutes ago you said that it was you”. It was then put to her that she said she was not leaving until the poster was taken down and that she would call the police. It was then put to her that the defendant said, “Fine, do it outside”, following which she went outside. She was asked if other people came to the store that she knew during this conversation and she said the only person who came was her brother, Mr Pougia. She was asked how he knew to come there, and she replied, “He just walked in by coincidence on the way home from work. He did not know I had this problem”. She could not recalled if he came in before or after the footage in question was shown, but she was certain he had not seen the footage.
	
	
	It was put to her that the defendant said, “Please move outside, you are blocking the shop”, to which the plaintiff replied, “How long before the police arrive?”, whereupon the defendant replied, “Well, you call them”. The plaintiff then said, “I can’t wait. I will leave my name and my phone number, please ring me when the police arrive”.
	
	
	The version of the conversation given by the plaintiff in examination in chief was not put to the defendant in cross-examination as Ms Chrysanthou notes in her written submissions (at paragraph 77). That makes any consideration of the defendant’s version of the conversation rather difficult.
	
	
	One issue is, however, clear. In none of the versions of the matter complained of, either from the plaintiff or the defendant, was there any reference to the plaintiff having taken her hands in and out of her pockets five times, or stealing five items.
	
	
	This is a significant omission, as this is the second pleaded imputation in relation to this publication. Its absence must cast doubt upon the version of the conversation given by the plaintiff in the statement of claim.
	
	
	Clearly, some allegation of being a “thief” was made, but it is a publication very different in terms to that which is pleaded. The question is whether this difference amounts to “fatal variance”.
	
	
	The onus of establishing publication lies on the plaintiff. Something was said, but the conflicting versions given make it impossible to determine what was said.
	
	
	Gatley deals at paragraphs 32.14 and 32.15 with the issue of “variance between words alleged and words proved”:
	


“The requirement to prove the actual words spoken does not mean that there must be complete correspondence between the words pleaded and the words proved. As long as the words proved are a material and defamatory part of the words alleged, or words which are substantially to the same effect, the claimant is entitled to have it decided, whether the words alleged or words to the like effect have been proved, or of course he could seek leave to amend his particulars of claim.

32.15 Fatal variance However if the words proved materially alter or qualify the sense of those set out in the particulars of claim, the variance will be fatal to the claimant, unless he can persuade the judge to grant him permission to amend the particulars of the claim.”


	
	In Umeyor v Ibe [2016] EWHC 862 at [1], Warby J notes the difficulties of proof of actions for slander and explains the need for precision as follows:
	


“[39] These are not mere technicalities. Liability for defamation depends on meaning, which is a subtle and nuanced thing. Quite small differences in wording can lead to significantly different meanings. In order to avoid the wrongful imposition of liability, precision is necessary. A feature of slander cases is that there can often be much room for dispute about what precisely was said”.


	
	In the present case, there is no evidence that the portions of the matter complained of giving rise to the second imputation were spoken at all. There is evidence that allegations of theft were put and denied, but there is no definitive account of what was said or what role (if any) the playing of the CCTV had (in circumstances where this is clearly referred to in the text of the matter complained of in the statement of claim).
	
	
	The plaintiff bears the onus of proof in relation to publication of the matter complained of.  On the balance of probabilities, the plaintiff cannot satisfy me that the second matter complained of was spoken as pleaded or as asserted by the plaintiff in her oral evidence, let alone heard by another person present in the shop.
	


Publication to a third party?


	
	On any version, the second matter complained of was a conversation before and after the showing of the CCTV which, in the version I have, is 5 minutes and 45 seconds. As noted above, the plaintiff’s estimate of the time taken by this conversation was half an hour.
	
	
	It is not in dispute that Mr Pougia, the plaintiff’s brother, came in while the conversation was taking place, but did not remain and did not hear any of the matter complained of.
	
	
	The plaintiff says that there were three women shoppers in the shop at the time and asks me to accept that the shop was so small that they must have heard every word of the conversation before, during and after the playing of the CCTV footage which, given the length of the footage and the time taken to locate it, must have taken more than ten minutes, if not the “half an hour” the plaintiff said was taken up.
	
	
	As Ms Chrysanthou points out in her written submissions (at paragraphs 78 – 82), the plaintiff must prove that a third person heard the whole of the matter complained of, and not merely a part. Ms Chrysanthou submitted that there was no evidence any shopper had been able to hear any, let alone all, of the matter complained of, which would have required any such person to wait around while the CCTV was located and played, as well as to hear what was said afterwards.
	
	
	I raised with Mr Dibb whether, given the reference to the CCTV footage being played, it formed part of the matter complained of to the persons hearing the words spoken, since these words consisted of a commentary upon the CCTV footage. He said that the footage did not form part of the matter complained of. If it did, the plaintiff would have to prove that the other shoppers saw it as well as heard the words spoken, which would require these other shoppers to be standing in viewing range of the CCTV screen, which did not form part of the plaintiff’s evidence. I will assume, for the purposes of this judgment, that Mr Dibb is correct in this regard, because if he is wrong, in that his client gave no evidence of other persons watching the CCTV, then that would be the end of the claim that a third party heard this oral publication.
	
	
	I do not accept Mr Dibb’s claim that the shop was so small that any shopper could hear every word spoken. Ms Barakat’s evidence was that she was at the back of the shop and did not know what was going on until she was called over by her father. The CCTV of the shop shows a series of narrow corridors of shelving with shoppers passing by each other in the course of making purchases and absorbed in their own activities. There is no suggestion that either the plaintiff or defendant was shouting or angry.
	
	
	A similar problem arose in Coles Supermarkets Australia Pty Ltd v Clarke [2013] NSWCA 272, where the sole witness called by the plaintiff in relation to a claim by store staff of stealing did not hear the matter complained of. This issue of publication to a third party was not directly addressed in the appeal but it would appear that the plaintiff in those proceedings was shouting and drawing attention to himself, as well as surrounded by several store staff, and the matter complained of was very short. None of those redeeming features is present here.
	
	
	This means that neither publication, nor publication to a third party, has been established.
	


Conclusions concerning publication


	
	The first matter complained of was not placed in the shop window. As no action has been brought in relation to publication of the poster elsewhere in the shop, this claim fails.
	
	
	The plaintiff has failed to establish that the oral publication occurred as pleaded and as given in evidence, or that it was published to a third party.
	
	
	The plaintiff has therefore failed to establish publication in relation to both matters complained of.
	
	
	In the event that I have erred in this finding, I have considered the defences as set out below.
	


The defences


	
	The defences pleaded are as follows:
	



	
	The defence of common law qualified privilege –
	



	
	The first matter complained of is pleaded in relation to a poster which was placed in the window of the shop. Mr Dibb concedes that if the poster was placed behind the counter as claimed by the defendant and his witnesses, he would not have made out his case.
	
	
	The submissions of both parties in relation to qualified privilege concerning the second publication depend upon whether the statements the defendant is asserted to have made were relevant to the occasion.
	
	
	If either of the publications was made on a protected occasion, the question of whether the defence is defeated by proof of malice must be determined.
	



	
	Justification – The defendant relies upon the CCTV footage as demonstrating that the plaintiff was in fact stealing items by repeatedly putting items into her pocket and glancing at the counter where Jackson Barakat was standing to see if she had been observed in so doing.
	
	
	Honest opinion – A defence of honest opinion (s 31 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW)) is pleaded. The plaintiff challenges whether the imputations are expressions of opinion or based on proper material. I note that the plaintiff has not pleaded any defeasance of this defence, a point also noted by the defendant (written submissions, paragraph 141).
	
	
	Damages – The question of quantum of damages, the interaction between the cap on damages and aggravated damages and mitigation are issues for determination.
	


Justification


	
	Section 25 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) provides:
	


“25 Defence of justification

It is a defence to the publication of defamatory matter if the defendant proves that the defamatory imputations carried by the matter of which the plaintiff complains are substantially true.”


	
	The task of proving an imputation true is not to be approached by focusing narrowly on a particular form in which the plaintiff has articulated the imputation.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s case is that she did in fact purchase a lipstick, as well as lollies and ice blocks, totalling $8. This is challenged by Jackson Barakat, who says that she only bought two cheap ice blocks and did not purchase any lipsticks or lollies.
	
	
	It is clear from the CCTV that it is being zoomed in and out. Jackson Barakat gave evidence about his knowledge of how he zoomed the camera in and out. He carried out this inquiry because his suspicions were aroused by the plaintiff’s conduct. I infer from his evidence that he zoomed in on the plaintiff after she began behaving suspiciously whilst standing in front of the makeup section in the store, which is adjacent to the front counter and where she would have been clearly visible. This is evident from the CCTV footage as the back of Jackson Barakat’s head could be seen, while the plaintiff was standing in front of the makeup counter. What particularly alerted Jackson Barakat was that the plaintiff cast him some covert glances. This means that the plaintiff’s suspicious conduct which led to Jackson Barakat zooming in on her on the CCTV must have commenced prior to the CCTV footage, which shows her already in the store looking at the objections in question.
	
	
	Although less than two metres from the plaintiff, Jackson Barakat could only see one side of her, namely the left hand side where the plaintiff had her hand in her pocket. He said that he did not challenge the plaintiff at the time in case he was wrong, but it is clear that during the time she was in the shop he had her under observation, as well as using the CCTV to zoom in on her.
	
	
	The footage shows the plaintiff casting a long convert glance towards Jackson Barakat from 37 seconds up until about 55 seconds, when the person identified as Jackson Barakat’s grandmother comes in. Mr Dibb submits that as the camera pulls out again to show the whole of that frame, what is revealed is that “the plaintiff is looking at her children” (paragraph 64, written submissions).
	
	
	This was not the evidence of the plaintiff, she said that she was looking at the conversation Jackson Barakat was having with the person he is seen greeting and embracing (evidence I do not accept, as the plaintiff can be seen continuing to stare in the direction of Jackson Barakat after this person had gone).
	
	
	I do not accept Mr Dibb’s submission that what the plaintiff is doing in this long suspicious glance is looking at her children. Her children are beside her and she is clearly looking beyond them. Nor do I accept Mr Dibb’s explanation (written submissions, paragraph 65) that the plaintiff “puts her hands in her pockets at some points” because it is “the coldest part of the winter”. The plaintiff has her left hand in her pocket but not her right, and the attire and manner of the other customers in the shop do not suggest that the temperature in the shop is so cold that the plaintiff needs to keep her hands in her pockets. At no stage does the plaintiff in fact put both hands in her pockets; she only puts her left hand in her pocket and it remains there for most of her visit to the shop.
	
	
	Jackson Barakat’s evidence on this issue, and indeed all issues, was clear and concise. He was not caught out in any lies or inconsistencies. The principal challenge to the evidence in relation to justification consisted of challenges to the video footage as “most unsatisfactory” (written submissions, paragraph 61), “act to mislead” (paragraph 64) and omitting what is called “the vital ending as the plaintiff checks out”.
	
	
	The defendant’s evidence is that the CCTV footage was given to the police on two occasions, the first being when Jackson Barakat provided a copy and the second on a date after the defendant went to the police in September 2016 to report the theft (see paragraph 19 of the statement of the defendant).
	
	
	According to the chronology, the police brief served on the plaintiff included the statement of the defendant, but no mention is made of the CCTV footage. Whether that was served or not (and it seems most unlikely that it was not), the plaintiff and her legal advisers must have seen the CCTV footage when the criminal prosecution came on for hearing at Mount Druitt Local Court, when the charge was withdrawn. Even if the plaintiff and her legal advisers still had not seen the footage, it is clear from the statement of the defendant (with which they were served, according to the chronology) that a copy had been provided to the police and this could have been obtained under subpoena; alternatively, the parties could have used the Defamation List to seek orders for discovery. The same applies to the request made for the docket printout for the plaintiff’s purchases.
	
	
	Evidence in relation to the plea of justification was also given by Taylah Barakat, who said that she checked her stock against the stock sheets the following morning and found seven or eight pieces of makeup were missing. Ms Barakat acknowledged that the shop suffered “shrinkage”. Mr Dibb submits that “much of this shortage of stock must on any view be the result of theft by other people” (written submissions, paragraph 62) and that it is not possible to infer from this evidence that the plaintiff stole anything. The stock sheets in question are not in evidence; I was not told whether or not they were included in the prosecution brief for the criminal proceedings.
	
	
	If the lipstick inventory checked by Taylah Barakat the next day against items still on the shelf had shown that no items were missing, that would be relevant. The fact that seven or eight items were missing is of very little persuasive value.
	
	
	When considering imputations of criminal conduct, it is often stated that the burden of proof to establish must be that imposed by s 140 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), namely that the trial judge must be comfortably satisfied that the evidence supports the findings made: Marsden v Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd. I acknowledge that there is some controversy concerning this burden of proof: Lower Murray Urban and Rural Water Corp v Di Masi; Lower Murray Urban and Rural Water Corp v Belbin; Lower Murray Urban and Rural Water Corp v Marciano (2014) 43 VR 348. Mr Dibb refers only to the balance of probabilities (written submissions, paragraph 69).
	
	
	On either test, I am satisfied that the evidence displayed that the plaintiff did in fact steal items from the shop, applying this finding to the facts. This amounts to a complete defence to the first publication.
	
	
	As to the second publication, I was not addressed by either counsel as to whether stealing items on one occasion meant that a person was a thief, or whether it was necessary to establish that the plaintiff had stolen five items, as opposed to merely one or two. The plaintiff is seen putting her hand into her pocket in a suspicious manner throughout the CCTV footage and I am satisfied that this could be sufficient to provide a complete defence to the second imputation as well as the first.
	
	
	The defence of justification would therefore succeed for both publications.
	


Qualified privilege


	
	In her written submissions, Ms Chrysanthou has set out the general principles for an occasion of qualified privilege, relevance to the occasion and the presumption of honesty (paragraphs 100-108). These principles are well-known and I do not need to repeat them.
	
	
	I note two preliminary features of the evidence in relation to this defence.
	
	
	First, although the plaintiff said in her evidence (although not in the statement of claim) that the defendant said he “knew her well”, there is no evidence that there was any prior hostility or ill will, or that the defendant and his children had anything other than a totally genuine belief that the plaintiff had shoplifted.
	
	
	Second, Mr Dibb acknowledges that the plaintiff has not sued on the basis of a photograph displayed behind the counter, on the basis that any publication on such an occasion “might indeed be covered by privilege” (paragraph 70). The defendant is sued on the basis of publication in the window to whoever happens to be passing by, which is submitted “is clearly not an occasion of privilege” (paragraph 71) as there could be no inference that all or even a significant portion of those who saw the notice so displayed would have an interest in knowing its contents. It is submitted that the defendant’s argument to the contrary is “very ambitious”. I am not provided with any authorities in support of this contention, or any consideration of the nature of CCTV footage or its use to detect and deter shop theft.
	
	
	I make the general observation, as to the issue of wider publication (such as in the shop window) that the defence of qualified privilege at common law has not kept up with the profound changes to communication which have occurred during the 20th century. Whether the defence should continue to be interpreted in the traditional way is, however, a matter for the appellate jurisdiction and/or legislative reform.
	
	
	However, the use by supermarkets and stores of CCTV images to help identify shoplifters is now an accepted procedure as well as being discussed in the press (see for example, B Shuhyta, “Supermarkets take to posting CCTV images to help identify shoplifters, lawyer warns of defamation risk”, ABC News, 20 January 2016). While the relationship of this defence with subsequent use of CCTV to obtain information about the identification of shoplifters has not been the subject of specific consideration, Ms Chrysanthou submits that existing law permits such activities and that the occasion (where the publication in question remains shop-related) is, therefore, protected.
	
	
	The limitation of qualified privilege to small groups of persons needs to be seen in the context of the wide public acceptance of use of CCTV. Implicit in that is that the duty and interest components must accordingly be widened to permit this intrusion into the rights of those filmed and the subsequent use of that material for purposes related to the use of CCTV in detecting crime, and especially shoplifting. As Ms Chrysanthou points out, there is a long history of the courts applying the privilege to protect personal and private interests in relation to business interest or reputation, as is noted by Professor Brown in Professor R. E. Brown, Brown on Defamation (Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, United States), Second Edition (formerly The Law of Defamation in Canada) (Carswell) at [13.6]. This is because store owners, of necessity, will utter defamatory remarks in an attempt to protect or recover their property interest in circumstance where a defendant accuses a plaintiff of committing an act of theft in circumstances where, although such words are directed to the plaintiff, casual observers may overhear the remark.
	
	
	Where a business owner is making an inquiry concerning the commission of a crime involving business interest or property, such as accusing an employee or third party of theft, the privilege will apply. In Nichols v J J Newberry Co, 150 F.2d 15 (9th Cir. 1945) a business who posted photographs of suspected criminals (supplied by the police) in an employee restroom was protected by the privilege. Similarly, in Pleau v Simpson-Sears (1977) 15 OR (2d) 436 (CA) the defendant’s store posted a notice to employees asking them to detain and report anyone with the plaintiff’s name who sought to cash a cheque, as the store has received information that the plaintiff’s wallet had been stolen and a cheque with his forged signature was cashed.
	
	
	In the United States, where shoplifting issues had been litigated extensively, courts have recognised the right of store proprietors, through their employees, to conduct enquiries into shoplifting, ranging from stopping persons from leaving the store to publishing communications for the purpose of obtaining information about a shoplifter’s identity. In some circumstances, this may extend to publication to the world at large. For example, where a mortgagee is selling mortgaged property, public notices may be given as to the indebtedness and the nature of the default and there are entitlements for holders of copyright to make public announcements aimed at warning others not to infringe their rights (see Brown on Defamation at [13.6(1)(b)(iv)]).
	
	
	Much would depend on the circumstances of the case and the degree to which the notice could be seen by the members of the public. If the publication in question had been placed on a noticeboard inside the shop, I am of the view that the privilege would still apply. This is because the protection of a business from potential thieves, and especially shoplifting, is an accepted part of business today which is why the intrusion of CCTV for this purpose is legislatively permitted.
	
	
	The real question is whether publication in a window where it could only been seen by members of the public passing by, as opposed to store employees and other regular shoppers who might know the plaintiff’s identity, is outside the parameters of the defence of qualified privilege at common law.
	
	
	This was not a publication to the world at large, but to persons walking past or entering the shop. The duty and interest arising out of the protection of property entitles a shop owner seeking the identity of a person to make inquiries of persons who frequent the shop or who walk past the door. This is because the public interest in the deterrence of crimes of this sort is such as to warrant the making of such a publication not only to any customer who see the sign on a noticeboard inside the shop but also who walk past the shop in circumstances where they are sufficiently close to see the sign and then enter the shop to impart the information.
	
	
	The occasion of the first publication, if it is a poster placed in the window in the manner claimed by the plaintiff, is therefore protected.
	


The second matter complained of


	
	The plaintiff initiated the conversation with the defendant and he responded to her inquiry by showing her the footage. She then challenged the footage and asked him to take it down and he refused.
	
	
	The second matter complained of was clearly made on an occasion protected by privilege in accordance with the principles set out in Brown on Defamation at [13.6] and Ms Chrysanthou’s submissions at paragraph 112 citing Henry v Minett (1910) 13 GLR (NZ) 138.
	
	
	The challenge to the occasion in relation to this publication is that it was exceeded by the intemperate language of the defendant (Skalkos v Assaf (2002) Aust Torts Reports 81-644). The defendant’s language consisted of a strong endorsement of the contents of the CCTV and a refusal to accept the plaintiff’s explanation. I consider the language did not exceed the occasion.
	
	
	The second publication was accordingly made on an occasion which was protected, and that protection was not lost by reason of the defendant’s statements or his subsequent conduct.
	


Malice


	
	Mr Dibb’s submissions (paragraphs 73-75) rely upon the following:
	



	
	The extent of publication, being to anyone who happened to be passing, which meant that the occasion was exceeded;
	
	
	The publication was principally made for an improper purpose, namely to humiliate and embarrass the plaintiff, rather than for her detection as a shoplifter; and
	
	
	The failure to remove the poster as soon as it was clear that the plaintiff has disputed the allegation or “to investigate it properly” by obtaining the full footage including the plaintiff’s checkout and to access and inspect the sales record on the till roll.
	



	
	This conflates malice in relation to both publications.
	
	
	As noted elsewhere, it is undisputed clear that no matter how dishonest the defendant’s statement to the police may have been, he genuinely believed that the plaintiff had been caught shoplifting by the CCTV footage. This means that the most common plea of malice, namely knowledge of the falsity, or absence of belief in its truth, is not in issue. Nor is it the case where there has been a failure to inquire. The actions of Taylah Barakat and Jackson Barakat, as well as of the defendant, indicate that each of them looked at the CCTV footage, asked what to do in relation to the conduct of the plaintiff, whom I am satisfied each of them genuinely believed to be a shoplifter.
	


Malice in relation to the first matter complained of


	
	The first matter complained of is a photograph of the plaintiff with the word “THIEF!” put on it twice. I do not consider this to be the introduction of material irrelevant to the occasion of qualified privilege. The manner and extent of publication and the language used is appropriate in the circumstances of the case. Taylah Barakat gave evidence that the purpose of the publication was to remind herself and employees of the plaintiff’s appearance and what she had done so that she could be barred from the entry to the shop in future. I am satisfied that this is the case.
	


Malice in relation to the second matter complained of


	
	The malice pleaded in relation to this claim is more difficult to determine. It appears to be that the defendant took no steps to restrict publication of what was said. In addition, there appears to be reliance upon the malice said to be established in relation to the poster.
	
	
	As Ms Chrysanthou notes in her written submissions at paragraph 30, neither of these constitutes grounds for the establishment of malice so as to defeat the defence of common law qualified privilege. The purpose of the conversation was to respond to what the plaintiff had said to the defendant. On any version of the conversation, the defendant’s response to the plaintiff was within appropriate parameters for a person dealing with someone he considered to have been guilty of shoplifting. He showed the plaintiff the CCTV footage and pointed to the occasions when she was said to have been putting items in her pockets. It is clear at all relevant times that the defendant had a genuine belief in the accuracy of the CCTV. Accordingly, any claim for malice must fail.
	


Conclusions concerning the defence of qualified privilege


	
	I am satisfied that each of the publications, if made, was made on an occasion protected by qualified privilege at common law and that the plaintiff has failed to establish malice so as to defeat this defence.
	


Honest opinion


	
	A defence of honest opinion must be responsive to the plaintiff’s pleaded imputations. The question is whether the meaning identified by the plaintiff is a comment as opposed to a statement of fact.
	
	
	Imputations that the plaintiff is a bully had been regarded as being statements of fact: Bennette v Cohen [2009] NSWCA 60. The question really is whether, in relation to each of the matters complained of, the imputation that the plaintiff is a thief is to defensible as comment in that it is in the nature of a deduction, inference or conclusion as opposed to a statement of fact.
	
	
	The first matter complained of consists of a photograph of the plaintiff and the word “THIEF!” being used twice. That is a statement of fact.
	
	
	As to the second matter complained of, the second imputation is clearly a statement of fact. While the imputation that the plaintiff is a thief may appear to be a conclusion in that it is in the nature of a deduction, inference or conclusion from seeing the CCTV, I am satisfied that it, too, is a statement of fact, rather than of opinion.
	
	
	The defence of honest opinion would fail for this reason. I am however satisfied that the opinions relate to a matter of public interest and relate to CCTV footage. I note that the plaintiff has not pleaded any defeasance to the honest opinion defences. In those circumstances, if I have erred in holding that the imputations are statements of fact rather than opinion, the defence would succeed.
	


Conclusions as to liability


	
	The plaintiff has failed to establish that the defendant published the first matter complained of (on both bases pleaded), and that the second publication was published, or that the second publication was made to a third party.
	
	
	If I have erred in these findings, the defences of justification and qualified privilege at common law would succeed in relation to both publications.
	
	
	The plaintiff sought substantial damages for these publications, while the defendant sought an order for nominal (or indeed zero) damages. I set out below my observations as to the damages which I would have awarded.
	


The relevant principles of law concerning damages


	
	Section 34 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) provides that:
	


“34 Damages to bear rational relationship to harm

In determining the amount of damages to be awarded in any defamation proceedings, the court is to ensure that there is an appropriate and rational relationship between the harm sustained by the plaintiff and the amount of damages awarded.”


	
	Section 35 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) caps the damages at $250,000. The maximum damages award has been increased from 1 July 2007 to the sum of $389,500 (New South Wales Government Gazette No. 56, 26 May 2017, p 1782). The significant increase in the statutory cap, which increased 46% over the first ten years: see J P Cashen “Defamation Cap Rising Well Above Inflation” (Gazette of Law and Journalism, 10 December 2014), should be noted. As Mr Cashen points out, the consumer price index in Victoria over the first decade, after the uniform legislation was passed, increased only 25%, and if the cap had kept place, it would have been only $314,000.
	
	
	The three purposes of defamation damages awards are consolation of hurt to feelings, recompense for damage to reputation and vindication of the plaintiff’s reputation (Rogers v Nationwide News Pty Ltd (2003) 216 CLR 327 at [60] per Hayne J (Gleeson CJ and Gummow J agreeing)).
	
	
	Three factors have led to a recent increase in the award of defamation damages. These are:
	



	
	The increase in the cap in excess of the consumer price index referred to above;
	
	
	Changes in the judicial interpretation of the role of the cap as set out below; and
	
	
	Changes in the judicial approach to the impact of an award of aggravated damages as to whether there should be a cap at all, as a result of the recent decision in Wilson v Bauer Media Pty Ltd [2017] VSC 521.
	



	
	When the uniform defamation legislation was enacted, judicial interpretation of the interaction between s 34 and the cap was that the cap was not merely a ceiling but a range in which general damages should be awarded: Attrill v Christie [2007] NSWSC 1386. Since that time, the cap has come to be interpreted as a simple cut off and does not impose a scaling exercise on lower awards: Cripps v Vakras [2015] VSC 193 per Kyrou J at [603]-[608]; Carolan v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd (No 6) [2016] NSWSC 1091 per McCallum J at [127]; Sheales v The Age Co Ltd [2017] VSC 380 per John Dixon J at [70]. Both counsel urge me not to follow Bell J in Attrill v Christie, although this appears to be contrary to the language of s 34, which by inference took into account similar damages regimes for personal injury.
	
	
	In addition, contrary to the explanation of the function of s 41 in relation to aggravated damages by Applegarth J in Cerutti v Crestside Pty Ltd [2016] 1 Qd R 89 and Rothman J in Al Muderis v Duncan (No 3) [2017] NSWSC 726. Section 41 has now been interpreted as taking the cap out of contention all together where an award of aggravated damages is to be made. The relevant decision is Wilson v Bauer Media Pty Ltd.
	


Relevant damages issues in these proceedings


	
	Each of the publications made in these proceedings is of a very limited nature. It is uncertain when the first publication was made; in oral submissions, Mr Dibb suggested it could have been put up a day or so before the plaintiff came to the shop on 13 July.
	
	
	The only reliable evidence as to when the publication was put up on behalf of the plaintiff is the text message from the plaintiff’s sister-in-law stating that she saw it at the front of the shop the day before the plaintiff’s visit.
	
	
	There is no reliable evidence as to when it was taken down, on the part of the plaintiff, beyond Mr Fou Vaa’s statement that the publication was in the window for “some weeks”, which, given the generality of his evidence, is of little or no evidentiary weight. The evidence of Taylah Barakat is that it was taken down that day. The defendant’s evidence on this is in conflict with his police statement, and I give his evidence no weight.
	
	
	The extent of publication in relation to the second matter complained of is even more limited. All that the plaintiff can point to is that there were a couple of other persons in the shop at the time and the defendant’s daughter, Taylah Barakat, may also have heard what was said. The plaintiff’s case does not include a claim that the plaintiff’s brother, who entered the shop briefly, heard the matter complained of being spoken.
	
	
	As to the extent of publication, there are similar difficulties. The plaintiff only called or relied upon evidence from members of her family to identify her. I note the names of two other persons in the Amended Statement of Claim in relation to the first matter complained of, but there is no evidence as to who these persons were, or as to how they recognised the plaintiff. However, some allowance would need to be made for the possibility of other persons passing the shop seeing the notice and identifying the plaintiff during the limited period that the notice was in the window.
	
	
	As to the second publication, there is no evidence that the unknown shoppers knew who the plaintiff was. Taylah Barakat did not know who the plaintiff was either.
	
	
	Given the very limited nature and extent of the publication of each of the matters complained of, the defendant submits that the damages should be at the bottom of the range. Mr Dibb submits that an award of aggravated damages should be made, because of the “high-handed and contemptuous treatment of the Plaintiff by the Defendant when she complained about the display of the Notice and because of the quite improper making by the Defendant of a statement to police after these proceedings had been commenced when that statement consisted largely of barefaced lies” (plaintiff’s written submissions, paragraph 88).
	
	
	Mr Dibb submits that, once aggravated damages come into consideration, the cap on the damages ceases to exist entirely and that damages in the range of $70,000 to $90,000 would be an appropriate award.
	


The interaction between general damages and aggravated damages


	
	The distinction between various categories of damages has been clarified by Devlin LJ in Rookes v Barnard [1964] AC 1129. Where the injury done to the plaintiff has been exacerbated by the conduct of the defendant, thereby attracting higher compensatory damages, a largely sum may be awarded. That larger sum should disregard malice or other state of mind of the defendant at the time of publication or at any other time, except to the extent that it affects the harm sustained by the plaintiff (s 36 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW)) but, where it does affect the harm, the proceedings may warrant greater compensation. Section 35(2) Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) provides:
	


“(2) A court may order a defendant in defamation proceedings to pay damages for non-economic loss that exceed the maximum damages amount applicable at the time the order is made if, and only if, the court is satisfied that the circumstances of the publication of the defamatory matter to which the proceedings relate are such as to warrant an award of aggravated damages.”


	
	Prior to Wilson v Bauer Media Pty Ltd, these issues were first considered in Davis v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2008] NSWSC 693, where McLellan CJ at CL noted the difficulties in relation to a cap where there was more than one publication and a claim for aggravated damages was made, adding (at [18]-[20]):
	


“[18] Section 35(2) provides that damages for non-economic loss may exceed the statutory cap. However, the exceedence is permissible “if, and only if, the court is satisfied that the circumstances of the publication of the defamatory matter to which the proceedings relate are such as to warrant an award of aggravated damages.” The plaintiff contends (inter alia) that by reason of the conduct of the defence during the course of the trial she is entitled to an award of aggravated damages. I shall relate the relevant facts below. If not excluded by the statute, an award of aggravated damages is available at general law. I discussed the principles relevant to aggravated damages in Jarratt v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2001] NSWSC 739 where I said:

113 The law recognises two elements of compensatory damages: ordinary and aggravated damages. In Bickel v John Fairfax & Sons Limited & Anor [1981] 2 NSWLR 474 at 496, Hunt J said:

Compensatory damages are given to compensate the plaintiff for the harm done to him by the publication of the matter complained of; aggravated compensatory damages (which are also known as merely 'aggravated damages') are given to compensate him when that harm has been aggravated by the defendant's conduct in publishing that matter or by his subsequent conduct.

114 It has also been stated that aggravated compensatory damages may be awarded if the defendant's conduct is ""improper, unjustifiable or lacking in bona fides"" (Vacik at [17]; Triggell v Pheeney (1951) 82 CLR 497 at 514).

115 The correct approach to aggravated damages was explained by Higgins J in Costello and Abbott v Random House Pty Limited(1999) 137 ACTR 1 at 46 where his Honour said:

The concept of 'aggravated damages' is not, whether calculated separately or not, a different 'head' of damage. It focuses on the circumstances of the wrong doing which had made the impact of it worse for the plaintiff. It is not to go beyond compensation for the aggravation of the harm to repute or feelings. It is not a means of punishing a defendant.

116 The difference between ordinary and aggravated damages was examined by Levine J in Marsden (para 4732 and following) where he pointed out that factors sometimes thought relevant only to aggravated damages are in fact relevant to ordinary compensatory damages: See Herald & Weekly Times Ltd v McGregor (1928) 41 CLR 254 considered by Clarke JA in Australian Consolidated Press Ltd v Ettinghausen (Court of Appeal, unreported, 13 October 1993 at p 25).

117 As the High Court noted in Gray at 4; in Uren v John Fairfax & Sons Pty Ltd (1965-66) 117 CLR 118 at 149, Windeyer J observed that the distinction between aggravated and exemplary damages is ""not easy to make in defamation, either historically or analytically; and in practice is hard to preserve."" The concept of aggravated damages serves as a reminder that there are different elements to the award of damages and the conduct of the defendant, when publishing or defending the publication, may, if unjustifiable, improper, or lacking in bona fides, be reflected in the award of damages if damage is by reason of that conduct suffered by the plaintiff: see Bickel at 497.

[19] It was submitted by the defendant that s 35(2) had the consequence that unless the entitlement to aggravated damages arises from “the circumstances of the publication of the defamatory matter”, they could not be awarded. The conduct of the trial is not such a circumstance and accordingly could not justify an award of aggravated damages.

[20] I do not accept the submission. Subsection (2) does not purport to deal in any general sense with a plaintiff’s entitlement to aggravated damages. The subsection is only concerned with the circumstances in which an award of damages for non-economic loss may exceed the statutory cap. Provided the award, including any component for aggravated damages by reason of the conduct of the defence or for other relevant reasons, does not exceed the statutory maximum, I am satisfied that an award of aggravated damages is available.”


	
	The first reference to the interaction between the award of aggravated damages and the possible exceeding of the cap is the decision of Applegarth J in Cerutti v Crestside Pty Ltd, where his Honour explained the interaction between general damages and the cap on damages as follows (at [41]-[42]).
	


“[41] An award of damages in excess of the statutory cap is permitted if the circumstances of publication are such as to warrant an award of aggravated damages. But this does not compel a judge to separately assess aggravated damages. In 1997 this court remarked in the context of a jury’s assessment of damages that there was no reason why the jury should have been obliged to answer a distinct question about aggravated damages. Circumstances of aggravation may justify “the court in assessing compensatory damages at a figure higher than that which would have been appropriate without those circumstances; but this does not mean that the increase is a separate category of damages.” The court observed:

“The jury is not to be invited to perform the difficult intellectual task of first considering the defamation in an abstract way, disregarding the circumstances in which it was published and the extent of publication, and then separately considering how much should be awarded for those matters”.

[42] A judge may be better-suited than a jury to perform such a task, and, in giving reasons, is able to explain the extent to which damages are increased on account of conduct which warrants an award of aggravated damages. The separate assessment of aggravated damages may enable an appeal court to isolate that part of an award that is attributed to aggravated damages, and to adjust an award of damages if the defendant’s conduct did not warrant an award of aggravated damages. However, the task of a trial judge should not be made more onerous than is necessary. A judge may assess a single amount which is appropriate to compensate for harm caused by the publication, and the additional harm to reputation or injured feelings caused by conduct which is improper, unjustifiable or lacking in bona fides.” (Footnotes omitted)


	
	However, as noted above, this was not the approach taken by John Dixon J in Wilson v Bauer Media Pty Ltd.
	
	
	One of the difficulties with the approach advocated by Mr Dibb is that, if aggravated damages remove the cap, then I must deal first with the question of whether aggravated damages should be awarded, rather than assessing general damages in the light of the cap and then having to revisit the topic of general damages on the basis that the cap no longer applies. This means that I must consider the issue of aggravated damages before considering general damages.
	


Should aggravated damages be awarded?


	
	The plaintiff submits that aggravated damages are appropriate because of the “high-handed and contemptuous treatment of the Plaintiff by the Defendant” when she complained and because of the making by the defendant of a statement to police which “consisted largely of barefaced lies” (paragraph 88, plaintiff’s written submissions).
	
	
	I do not consider any aspect of the defendant’s treatment of the plaintiff, whom he considered to be a shoplifter based on CCTV evidence, to warrant the awarding of aggravated damages. This is not a case where there is “malevolence or spite” (Rookes v Barnard [1964] AC 1129 at 1221 per Lord Devlin). These were not reckless publications; to the contrary, the defendant showed the plaintiff the CCTV in question and invited her to give an explanation. Nor is the extent and mode of publication unreasonable in the circumstances, having regard to the nature of CCTV and its role in the detection of crime, including the need to identify persons seen on CCTV committing crime such as shoplifting.
	
	
	Taking all of the above into account, I am satisfied that aggravated damages should not be awarded. This would mean, even if Mr Dibb’s submissions concerning the cap were accepted, that the cap would apply.
	


General damages


	
	All of the factors in this case point to two publications of an extremely limited nature where the sole witnesses were the plaintiff and her children or the one to three strangers who did not know the plaintiff.
	
	
	The most significant aspect is hurt to feelings. The two witnesses called by the plaintiff as reputation witnesses had not seen the publication but attested to her hurt to feelings. However, Bishop Karaka has only known the plaintiff for the last 14 months, and all that he could say was that her reputation was good. Meryl Betham, a former member of the same Mormon church as the plaintiff, did give such evidence, but it was of a limited nature.
	
	
	If I were to award damages, I would not accept Ms Chrysanthou’s submissions that any amount should be nominal. Nor would I award zero dollars in damages (Dank v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2016] NSWSC 295) as proposed in her schedule of damages. I must have regard to the relevant features of judicial awards which are pushing damages upwards, including the judicial interpretation of the cap and the disproportionate rise of the gazetted cap. I can only disregard decisions such as Wilson v Bauer Media Pty Ltd because I consider aggravated damages should not be awarded.
	
	
	The authorities are divided as to whether other awards of damages should be taken into account. Although this information is readily available, most judgments arrive at an assessment of damages in a few sentences without any reference to comparable verdicts.
	
	
	Where courts have given details, those judgments are, however, particularly helpful. I particularly note the New South Wales Court of Appeal decision in Bristow v Adams [2012] NSWCA 166; although this included a component for aggravated damages, the reasoning involved is not only helpful but a useful measuring stick, although the extent of publication in this case would be very much smaller.
	
	
	Appropriate awards would be $7,500 for the first publication and $2,500 for the second publication (see Beaven v Fink [2009] NSWDC 218 for a comparable verdict, a slander to a neighbour), making a total of $10,000.
	


Mitigation of damages


	
	The defendant submits that, if the plaintiff succeeds on liability, any damages should be minimal given the matters pleaded and proved in mitigation by the defendant, even if, in some respects, the plea of justification fails, the evidence put forward in support of that defence can still be relied upon: Pamplin v Express Newspapers Ltd (No 2) [1988] 1 WLR 116 at 120; Holt v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd (2014) 86 NSWLR 96 at [32].
	
	
	One example would be if the defendant was unable to establish the truth of imputation (b), namely that the plaintiff put five items in her pocket, as opposed to only putting two in her pocket. There are a number of possibilities depending upon the findings of fact in the relevant case.
	
	
	It is an exercise which, given my findings in these proceedings, is really not possible to do. Accordingly, I do not propose to determine this issue.
	


Costs


	
	Each of the parties asks to be heard in relation to the issue of costs after this judgment is delivered. One of the applications that is made by the defendant is for a personal costs order in relation to the circumstances of the adjournment of the hearing on the first day, the assertion being that the plaintiff’s solicitor was responsible. I consider that all costs issues should be dealt with at the same time and, accordingly, I have reserved all issues of costs for further determination.
	


Orders


	
	Judgment for the defendant.
	
	
	Costs reserved.
	
	
	Liberty to restore in relation to costs.
	
	
	Exhibits retained for 28 days.

		02 November 2017",2017-11-01 00:00:00,NSW District Court
6320407,Lynn v Thompson [2017] NSWDC 296,"Judgment


	
	These are my reasons for orders made on 26 October 2017 concerning the following:
	



	
	An application pursuant to r 28.2 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (“UCPR”) and r 14.30 in relation to imputations pleaded to arise from the matter complained of the subject of these proceedings; and
	
	
	An application for summary dismissal of the proceedings on the principles set out in Bleyer v Google Inc (2014) 88 NSWLR 670 (as recently endorsed by Basten JA in Farrow v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2017] NSWCA 246 at [5]) and pursuant to s 60 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW).
	



	
	The matter complained of is asserted to be an email “sent to a number of recipients, the identity of many of whom the plaintiff is presently unaware” but which included a Mr Malcolm Sayers, who forwarded the email to the plaintiff. Unfortunately, the schedule to the statement of claim attaches only the email Mr Sayers sent to the plaintiff. It is unclear whether he sent it to the plaintiff care of the Gmail address identified in the matter complained of or some other email address which is unknown.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s failure to attach the email sent to Mr Sayers, or to indicate how he came upon it, either in the pleadings or in subsequent correspondence, is a significant difficulty. In addition, if Mr Sayers and other persons did republish the defendant’s email, and a claim is brought on the principles of Speight v Gosnay (1891) 55 JP 501, these publications must be pleaded with some care to avoid the trap of the court being misled as to whether these are publications sued upon as causes of action or merely as going to damages (as to which see Habib v Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd [2009] NSWCA 231). In addition, issues such as “the grapevine effect” which go to damages, should not be included in the particulars of publication.
	
	
	The defendant’s attack upon the proportionality of these proceedings is put on the following bases:
	



	
	The award of damages is likely to be minimal given the very limited nature of publication demonstrated by the statement of claim, in that the matter complained of consists of the defendant’s email being on-forwarded by its recipient to the plaintiff, which would not be actionable;
	
	
	The factual issues are complex, in that it would require investigation into events occurring in Papua New Guinea over a potential 20 year period and may require witnesses being called from overseas as well as within Australia and Papua New Guinea government departments.
	



	
	This argument cannot proceed until such time as the plaintiff has set out the precise basis upon which publication is alleged by the defendant and to whom. If the email in question was some form of circular email to, for example, members of a RSL Club or organisation (as seems possible from the format of the letter), that must be set out. If reliance is placed upon republication being an actual and probable consequence, whether by Mr Sayers or not, that must be specified with some care, and it must be identified whether the extent of that publication is relied upon as going to liability or merely quantum.
	
	
	The plaintiff sought an adjournment of the argument so that particulars of the extent of publication could be administered and the result of inquiries already instituted on behalf of the plaintiff could be considered. Mr Rasmussen indicated he would not oppose the granting of an adjournment of the argument provided that his client’s costs were paid on an indemnity basis.
	
	
	The pleading of a claim for defamation where electronic publication is involved can often be a very technical exercise, requiring considerable care and skill. Unfortunately, in the present case, the pleading suffers a series of pleading defects ranging from failing to attach the correct matter complained of to the conflating of damages and liability issues in the particulars of publication.
	
	
	The extent of publication is a significant issue in any application for summary dismissal, and not merely in an application based on Jameel principles (Jameel (Yousef) v Dow Jones & Co Inc [2005] QB 946). In Bode v Mundell [2016] EWHC 2533 (QB), Warby J noted as an alternative finding to the question of serious harm that the proceedings would have had failed an abuse of the Jameel variety even if his Honour had concluded that the case should not be struck out on the basis of absence of serious harm for the purposes of s 1 Defamation Act 2013 (UK) by reason of the matter complained of being addressed to two individuals in circumstances where the harm could have been put right without any need for litigation.
	


The form of the interrogatories


	
	What should be the interrogatories to be administered, and should these be settled by the court?
	
	
	This is a different publication problem to that encountered by McCallum J in Dank v Cronulla-Sutherland District Rugby League Football Club [2013] NSWSC 1101, where her Honour formulated the interrogatories at paragraph 29 in circumstances where there was doubt about whether the defendant had published the matter complained of at all.
	
	
	There are two reasons for my not adopting the procedure taken by her Honour. The first is that applications of this nature often proceed on the basis of evidence as to the extent of publication (as was the case in Bleyer v Google Inc), whereas the application made in Dank v Cronulla-Sutherland District Rugby League Football Club was of the traditional kind, namely information about whether the defendant actually published the matter at all.
	
	
	The second reason is neither the parties nor the court have the information necessary to draft these interrogatories. The defendant in the present case admits publication to a third party, but nothing more. I have very little information as to what the nature and extent of the publication in question may be. The opening sentences of the matter complained of and the absence of personal information directed to the recipient are suggestive of the possibility that this email was sent to a group of persons such as club members but I have no other indications as to what the extent of publication would be.
	
	
	In the circumstances, in the interests of the claim proceeding without unnecessary supervision by the court, I propose to leave it to the plaintiff to draft the appropriate interrogatories for the purpose of a Bleyer v Google Inc argument.
	


Form and capacity of the imputations


	
	This brings me to the reasons for striking out imputations 2(c) and 2(d) as not differing in substance from imputation 2(b) and the striking out imputations 2(e) and 2(f) on the basis of form.
	
	
	The imputations are as follows (paragraph 2 of the statement of claim):
	



	
	The plaintiff is a liar;
	
	
	The plaintiff pretends to care about the heritage and preservation of the Kokoda Trail but really he is just interested in advancing his own egotistical aspirations and personal interests;
	
	
	The plaintiff is self-interested;
	
	
	The plaintiff is an egotist;
	
	
	The plaintiff is an awful person who has made promises to the villagers along the Kokoda Trail over 20 years and has failed to deliver on any of them;
	
	
	The plaintiff has let down the villagers along the Kokoda Trail, most of whom despise the plaintiff;
	
	
	The plaintiff caused tensions between the people of Papua New Guinea and visiting Australians;
	
	
	The plaintiff owes an apology to the public for his shameful self-promotion antics;
	
	
	The plaintiff is untrustworthy.
	



	
	Imputations 2(c) and 2(d) both arise from the same portions of the matter complained of. All three imputations (i.e. imputations 2(b), 2(c) and 2(d)) are imputations of condition. Whereas the first imputation puts a more specific condition, imputations 2(c) and 2(d) merely separate out the words “self-interested” and “egotist”, as separate imputations.
	
	
	Ms White admitted that a plaintiff could plead an imputation of condition in precise form and then plead an imputation in more general form, citing Toben v Milne [2014] NSWCA 200 at [13]:
	


“[13] An example of the application of the ‘test’ articulated by Hunt J is to be found in John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Hitchcock [2007] NSWCA 364; 70 NSWLR 484. In that case, McColl JA held that the imputation that the plaintiff had gate crashed a social function knowing she was not invited was different in substance from the imputation that the plaintiff had merely gate-crashed a social function, because to prove the first it would be necessary to demonstrate the respondent’s state of mind, whereas that was not necessary for the latter. Her Honour found that although there was clearly a significant overlap in the imputations pleaded, there was a point of difference sufficient to support the independent pleading of the different imputations.”


	
	The plaintiff’s self-interest and egotism really amount to the same thing, namely his real motive for his activities, as opposed to merely pretending to care about the heritage and preservation of the Kokoda Trail. The identical passages of the matter complained of are relied upon. Given the close similarity in content as well as form, this general charge should not be broken down into three overlapping imputations in the manner pleaded. I accordingly struck out imputations 2(c) and 2(d) as not differing in substance.
	
	
	Imputations 2(e) and 2(f) contain words which are ambiguous. Imputation 2(e), which pleads that the plaintiff “is an awful person”, although admittedly set out the basis for saying this, fails to identify what that awful conduct amounts to, in terms of whether it is untrustworthiness, dishonesty or mere unreliability. The word does not appear in the matter complained of. It is a poor choice of word and it is preferable to strike the imputation out rather than run the risk that it will be repleaded in a manner which does not differ in substance from the other imputations.
	
	
	I have similarly struck out imputation 2(f) on the basis that an imputation that the plaintiff “has let down the villagers along the Kokoda Trail” is insufficiently specific, however the plaintiff will have leave to replead.
	
	
	I also note that imputation 2(g) was reworded during argument, by reason of the word “caused” being a “weasel word”: Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden (1998) 43 NSWLR 158 per Hunt J.
	
	
	I must note, however, that there are unfortunately conflicting decisions on this issue as a result of recent decisions in the Federal Court of Australia. In Goodfellow v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited [2017] FCA 1152 at [52] – [60] Wigney J, ruling on a series of imputations using this word (for example, that the applicant, a police officer, “improperly caused a number of drug charges to be dropped against a violent criminal”), expressed dissatisfaction with the New South Wales Court of Appeal’s decision to the contrary in Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden, observing:
	


“[55] It is, with the greatest respect, difficult to see how a plain English word like “caused” could be described as a “weasel word”. That would depend entirely on the context in which the word is used. It could perhaps be accepted that in some circumstances, considered in isolation and in the abstract, the words “improperly” or “caused” might be of uncertain import. Read in isolation, they might in some circumstances prompt the questions: “how is it said that the conduct was improper” or “how is it said that the conduct caused something to occur”?”


	
	While I note that Wigney J was not prepared to follow the New South Wales Court of Appeal, I must do so, particularly where the judgment in question was that of Hunt CJ at CL, whose expertise in defamation law in Australia is undoubted.
	
	
	An additional reason for not being persuaded to discard the New South Wales Court of Appeal’s decision is Wigney J’s rulings on other words, such as “improper”. Despite decisions of the New South Wales Court of Appeal (such as Australian Broadcasting Corporation and Anor v Hodgkinson [2005] NSWCA 190), and despite the word “improper” having a statutory use (see, for example, Commissioner of Taxation v Day (2008) 250 ALR 388), which may give rise to the kind of ambiguity of meaning which fatally doomed the trial in Singleton v Ffrench (1986) 5 NSWLR 425, Wigney J refused to strike this word out. A challenge to the word “wrongly” was also dismissed, despite the New South Wales Court of Appeal’s decision in Ma Ching Kwan v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd (New South Wales Court of Appeal, 30 July 1998, unreported), although Ma Ching Kwan v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd was followed by the Federal Court of Australia in Murphy v Nationwide News Pty Ltd (No 2) [2017] FCA 781 and relied upon to strike out the word “inappropriately” on the basis that it was similarly flawed (see similar observations by Rothman J in Ultrasonic Slimming Pty Ltd v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd [2013] NSWSC 1987 at [24] – [27]). These rulings should all be viewed in the same light, as Wigney J was not taken to the relevant authorities when determining these issues.
	


Costs


	
	Only in very rare cases should an order be made for indemnity costs in the course of case management of defamation proceedings.
	
	
	I briefly note my reasons for making such an order in relation to the hearing on proportionality, which has now been adjourned twice in the Defamation List and which cannot be ready to go ahead until the plaintiff has provided the matter complained of (as opposed to the copy forwarded by the recipient to the plaintiff) and particulars or evidence of publication of the kind that would demonstrate the extent of publication sufficient to combat the defendant’s arguments.
	
	
	The making of an order for indemnity costs requires an significant departure from the obligation of a litigant to conduct litigation in a speed and efficient manner (Oshlack v Richmond River Council (1998) 193 CLR 72). In the present case, Mr Rasmussen pointed to the following factors as being relevant:
	



	
	Particulars of the extent of publication had been sought and had been answered with a statement that this was “a matter for evidence” at the trial;
	
	
	The argument had been ready to proceed in the Defamation List on 21 September 2017 and had been adjourned to suit the convenience of the plaintiff’s counsel;
	
	
	The application for adjournment had been made at a very late stage, namely the day before the hearing was to proceed, and was made only in the alternative, namely if the argument on proportionality were likely to succeed; and
	
	
	The failure to attach the matter complained of in the form of the email from the defendant to Mr Sayers, rather than his on-forwarding of this document to the plaintiff.
	



	
	The unreadiness of the plaintiff on this second occasion, when the defendant was ready to proceed, is complicated by the difficulty that the plaintiff first proposed interrogation as to the extent of publication only yesterday, and then as an alternative to the argument failing. The argument cannot go ahead in any event with the matter complained of in its present form.
	
	
	Mr Rasmussen also told the court that his client is a pensioner who resides in Queensland, with all the attendant difficulties of representation that this connotes.
	
	
	The allegations made about the plaintiff in the matter complained of are very serious, and he is entitled to seek redress from the court expeditiously. That requires, however, compliance with the principles set out in ss 56 – 62 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) as well as with the relevant practice note for conduct in this list. Time in the Defamation List is limited and when an argument is not ready to proceed on two occasions, that causes real difficulty in terms of accommodating other cases before the court, as well as straining court resources.
	
	
	Parties must be ready to proceed when arguments are listed for hearing. While I do not make this order for the purpose of “encouraging others” not to do so (to use Voltaire’s explanation of the execution of Admiral Byng), ensuring compliance with court timetables and readiness for hearing are an essential part of case management. This is particularly the case in defamation proceedings where a defendant is not an experienced media litigant and where the very substantial costs of defending a defamation action can be the cause of significant worry and anxiety. Accordingly, an order for costs on an indemnity basis for this part of the application before me today is warranted.

	Challenge to imputations 2(a) and 2(i) as not differing in substance is dismissed.
	
	
	Strike out imputation 2(f) with liberty to replead.
	
	
	Grant leave to replead imputation 2(g) by replacing the word “caused” by “heightened”.

	Plaintiff pay the defendant’s costs of the r 28.2 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) argument (on capacity) and r 14.30 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) argument (on form) on an ordinary basis.

		31 October 2017",2017-10-25 00:00:00,NSW District Court
6320420,Dagher v R [2017] NSWCCA 258,"Judgment


	
	LEEMING JA: I agree with Adamson J.
	
	
	JOHNSON J: I agree with Adamson J.
	
	
	ADAMSON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed on her by Delaney ADCJ on 22 May 2017 for one count of obtaining a financial advantage by deception contrary to s 134.2 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (the Code). The sentence of imprisonment was for a term of 2 years from 22 May 2017 with a direction that the applicant be released after 12 months pursuant to s 20(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (the Act) upon entering into a self-recognisance in the sum of $500 to be of good behaviour for 12 months. She is due to be released on 21 May 2018. All references to legislation in these reasons are references to the Crimes Act unless otherwise stated.
	
	
	The applicant relied on the following three grounds of appeal:
	



	
	His Honour erred in concluding that the applicant had shown no remorse or contrition, because she had permitted the offence to continue for a number of years, even notwithstanding evidence of post-offence conduct, which demonstrated such remorse and contrition.
	
	
	His Honour failed to reduce, in accordance with s 16AC, the sentence imposed upon the applicant, to reflect the value of her undertaking to cooperate with law enforcement agencies, in proceedings relating to other offences.
	
	
	His Honour erred in failing to take into account the effects which a sentence of imprisonment would have upon the applicant's family.
	



	
	The Crown conceded that the second ground had been made out which had the effect that the sentence had not been imposed according to law. The parties agreed that it was, accordingly, necessary for the applicant to be re-sentenced and that it was unnecessary in these circumstances that the other two grounds be addressed.
	
	
	I propose to address the second ground briefly before turning to re-sentence.
	


Ground 2


	
	Section 16AC provides that if a court imposing a sentence for a federal offence reduces the severity of the sentence or the non-parole order because the offender has undertaken to co-operate with law enforcement authorities in proceedings relating to the offence, the court must state that the sentence is being reduced for that reason and specify the sentence that would have been imposed but for that reduction: s 16AC(1) and (2). If the person does not co-operate in accordance with the undertaking the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal against the sentence: s 16AC(3). The court hearing the appeal can increase the sentence if it is satisfied that the offender has, without reasonable excuse, failed to co-operate, entirely or in part: s 16AC(4).
	
	
	The sentencing judge failed to comply with the requirement of s 16AC and, in particular, did not identify what sentence would have been imposed but for the undertaking to co-operate with investigating authorities in the future. This is an error of law which requires correction.
	
	
	I note that his Honour at various stages of the sentence hearing sought assistance from the Crown as to the provisions relevant to sentences for federal offences, it being apparent that his Honour was more accustomed to sentencing for state offences under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). After his Honour had pronounced sentence he asked the parties if there was an issue with what had been pronounced. On no occasion did the Crown, or the applicant’s representative, remind the sentencing judge of the requirements of s 16AC, though they were plainly germane to the sentence to be imposed on the applicant, having regard to her undertaking. Legal representatives, and the Crown in particular, have an obligation to assist courts to perform their functions in accordance with the law. It is part of a prosecutor’s duty to inform the Court of any legislation bearing on the appropriate sentence and to assist the Court to avoid appealable error on the issue of sentence: Rule 95(b) and (c) of the Legal Profession Uniform Conduct (Barristers) Rules 2015; and Rules 29.12.2 and 29.12.3 of the Legal Profession Uniform Law Australian Solicitors’ Conduct Rules 2015. The second ground of appeal is the result of the failure of the Crown to provide adequate assistance to the sentencing judge.
	
	
	It was accepted by the parties that a re-sentencing exercise was required. The Crown initially proposed that this Court ought remit the matter to the sentencing judge to specify the discount for future assistance pursuant to s 12(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) in accordance with the approach taken by this Court in R v Whitney (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW) Gleeson CJ, Cole JA and Newman J, 6 November 1997, unrep). In R v Whitney the Crown proposed that course, which was not opposed by the appellant. I consider that, as error is accepted, this Court ought undertake the re-sentencing exercise itself, rather than remit it to the sentencing judge.
	
	
	This Court must re-sentence the applicant as at the date of re-sentence and must exercise the discretion afresh. Apart from a joint note provided by the parties (to which reference will be made below), no material has been provided to this Court beyond that which was before the sentencing judge. Accordingly, the material for sentencing which was before Delaney ADCJ remains, with the joint note, the basis on which the applicant will be re-sentenced. The applicant did not give evidence at the sentence hearing before Delaney ADCJ. The only oral evidence was given by the applicant’s husband, who was not cross-examined.
	


Relevant legislative provisions


	
	The applicant is a federal offender. The sentence is to be determined in accordance with Part 1B of the Act. Section 16A(1) requires a Court sentencing a person for a federal offence to impose a sentence of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence. The Court is required to take into account the matters listed in s 16A(2) and any other relevant matters, insofar as they are relevant and known to the Court.
	
	
	The maximum custodial penalty for the offence is 10 years’ imprisonment.
	


The nature and circumstances of the offence (s 16A(2)(a))


	
	Between about 24 May 2013 and 13 November 2015, the applicant claimed and obtained welfare payments from DHS Centrelink (Centrelink) including Carer Payment and Carer Allowance in respect of two of her children whom she knew were not unwell in circumstances where she either knew or believed that she was not entitled to them. She paid a fee of $8,000 to two co-offenders to obtain the assistance she needed to fill out the forms and obtain the required supporting documentation.
	
	
	When Centrelink initiated a review of the payments in respect of the applicant’s son and one daughter, she took those two children to appointments with different doctors to obtain the necessary documentation to fulfil the requirements of the review. The applicant signed and submitted the review form in respect of her daughter. The doctor who saw the applicant's son in the presence of the applicant requested only the child's name and date of birth. No examination of the child was conducted at that time. Thus she again took active steps to obtain documentation to perpetuate the false claims.
	
	
	The applicant's conduct continued until Centrelink advised her in November 2015 that the payments would be stopped on the basis that the claims and supporting documents did not accurately reflect the children’s care requirements or that they did not qualify as dependants.
	
	
	As a result of her dishonesty the applicant received, during the period 24 May 2013 and 13 November 2015, a total of $66,447.53 from the Commonwealth to which she was not entitled. An amount of $49,764.43 related to Carer Allowance and the balance, $16,683.10 related to Carer Payment. The amount of money involved and the length of time over which the fraudulent offending occurred are significant relevant considerations when determining the objective seriousness of the offending: R v Hawkins (1989) 45 A Crim R 430 at 435 (Lee J). The use to which the dishonestly appropriated funds were put is a relevant consideration. It was not suggested that the offending in the present case occurred as a result of any real or perceived need.
	


Contrition (s 16A(2)(f)); prospect of rehabilitation (s 16A(2)(n))


	
	It was submitted on the applicant’s behalf that she has shown contrition by pleading guilty to the offence. The applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court on 16 August 2016, which was the sixth occasion on which the matter had been listed in that Court. She adhered to her plea before Delaney ADCJ on 22 May 2017. I regard her plea in these circumstances as a pragmatic response in the face of a strong Crown case, rather than a demonstration of remorse.
	
	
	It was also submitted that the applicant had shown contrition by expressing shame and regret for her actions. The offending did not cease due to any action taken on the part of the applicant. If the offending had not been detected by Centrelink, there is no reason to suppose that it would not have continued. Thus, any remorse could only date from the time the applicant’s criminal conduct was detected and the payments stopped. Although the applicant did express regret for her actions, she did not give sworn evidence at the sentence hearing to enable those expressions to be tested.
	
	
	Further, when she was interviewed for the purpose of a Pre-Sentence Report dated 1 May 2017, the author recorded the following:
	


“Attitude to offending

[The applicant] disputed elements of the Facts. She maintained that she was not aware of the illegality of her actions. She expressed shame and regret for her actions, although deflected responsibility for the offence to other parties She voiced her commitment to paying restitution.

. . .

Assessment

. . . [s]he claimed to have been unaware that her actions were illegal, instead apportioning blame to the third parties named in the Facts.”


	
	It is difficult to reconcile the applicant's expressions of shame and regret to the author of the Pre-Sentence Report with her statements that she did not know that her actions were illegal. I do not accept that the applicant did not know her actions were illegal at the time. The offending involved the applicant making claims for a Carer Payment and a Carer Allowance in respect of two of her children whom she knew were not unwell.
	
	
	It was also submitted that the applicant had shown contrition by making arrangements to repay the Centrelink debt. The evidence tendered on behalf of the applicant showed that Centrelink wrote to the applicant on 24 January 2017 confirming the account balance of $83,545.39 and the repayment arrangement of a lump sum payment of $20,000 by 31 January 2017 and monthly repayments of $500 per month with the first payment to be made on 28 February 2017. Had the applicant not made an acceptable offer to repay the debt and repayments had not been made in accordance with the agreement interest would have been compounded daily. The material also sets out other measures available to Centrelink to recover the monies owed, which were a debt due to the Commonwealth. By entering into an arrangement with Centrelink to repay the monies, the applicant was acting in her own financial interest. In these circumstances I do not regard the arrangement to repay the debt or the repayments made to date as demonstrating contrition.
	
	
	In these circumstances I do not consider the evidence to be sufficient to indicate her prospects of rehabilitation.
	


Plea of guilty (s 16A(2)(g))


	
	The timing and circumstances of the plea of guilty are set out above.
	


Degree of co-operation (s 16A(2)(h))


	
	The applicant provided a letter of assistance dated 5 January 2017 which relevantly said:
	


“Assistance provided by the offender to date

The Defendant has agreed to sign an undertaking under s 16AC of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) to be a witness and give evidence in proceedings against [persons named in the letter of assistance] which will be handed up with this letter.

. . .

Grading

The Defendant has been co-operative and has indicated a preparedness to assist the prosecution by providing an induced statement and giving evidence against co-accused. When evaluating her level of assistance, consideration has been given to what assistance the Defendant was able to and did in fact provide and what future assistance she has committed to.

The AFP assesses the Defendant's assistance as being of medium value.”


	
	The letter also confirmed that the information provided by the applicant largely corroborated evidence which the Australian Federal Police (AFP) had already obtained. The applicant volunteered information without evidence being put to her. The information which she provided was different in some respects from the information she had given in her recorded interview. Both the applicant and the AFP were of the view that the applicant was not putting herself or other persons at risk by providing assistance to authorities.
	
	
	One of the alleged co-offenders (A) died on 17 June 2015. Accordingly, the assessment of the value of the applicant’s assistance contained in the letter of assistance set out above took into account that there was only one surviving potential co-offender in respect of whose prosecution the applicant could provide assistance, being alleged co-offender B. On 5 May 2017 the applicant signed an undertaking to co-operate with law enforcement authorities pursuant to s 16AC.
	
	
	The parties have provided to this Court an agreed statement of facts dated 18 October 2017 as follows:
	


“1. The Letter of Assistance provided by the Australian Federal Police dated 5 January 2017, which assessed the assistance to be provided by the Applicant to the authorities as being of medium value, took into account the death of one of the Applicant's two co-offenders (Co-offender A) on 17 June 2015.

2. The section 16AC Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) undertaking to provide future assistance dated 5 May 2017 relates to a single co-offender of the Applicant (Co-offender B).

3. Charges have now been laid against Co-offender B. Co-offender B has not yet entered a plea.

4. The current grading of the Applicant's undertaking to provide future assistance in the prosecution of Co-offender B is medium value.”


	
	The question of the separate evaluation of future assistance will be addressed below.
	


Specific deterrence (s 16A(2)(j))


	
	There is also a need for a significant specific deterrent aspect to the sentence, as demonstrated by the extensive period of offending and the amount of money appropriated in this case.
	


General deterrence (s 16A(2)(ja)) and punishment (s 16A(2)(k))


	
	General deterrence and punishment are of primary importance in sentencing for offences of this nature. In R v Annecchini (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), Gleeson CJ, Allen and James JJ, 24 April 1996, unrep), Gleeson CJ said:
	


“It is generally the fact that considerations of general deterrence are of importance in dealing with social security fraud. One of the reasons for that is that conduct such as that engaged in by the present appellant is difficult to detect, indeed it is probably detected in a relatively small proportion of cases, and when it is detected it is appropriate that other people in the community who might be tempted to engage in such conduct should understand the penal consequences that attach to it. Indeed, questions of morale become involved if those in the community come to think that people who practise fraud of this kind upon the Commonwealth can get away with it or, if apprehended, will be dealt with leniently...”

The applicant’s character, antecedents, age, means and physical and mental condition (s 16A(2)(m))


	
	The applicant is 47 years old. She has no criminal history. She was born in Sierra Leone and migrated to Lebanon before arriving in Australia in May 1994. Her husband sponsored her immigration. The couple has six children, two of whom, by 5 May 2017, were married. The remaining four children, aged between 6 and 17 live with the couple at their home in Mt Pritchard in the Liverpool area. The applicant and her husband own their house subject to a mortgage which, as at May 2017 still had $227,000 outstanding. The monthly payments were around $1,600 per month. The applicant’s husband worked as a self-employed courier. His approximate after-tax annual income was $44,000. All four children go to school. Before her incarceration, the applicant took them to school. Two of the children, both girls, who were aged 12 and 17 in May 2017, have medical conditions (asthma and epilepsy) which require medication, which was obtained by the applicant.
	
	
	The applicant’s husband gave evidence at the sentence hearing in May 2017 that if his wife were incarcerated he would have to stop work to look after the children and that he had no other means of repaying the mortgage. As no evidence or other information is before the court as to the family’s current circumstances, I am not prepared to infer that what the applicant’s husband predicted as the outcome of the imposition of a custodial sentence on his wife has come to pass.
	
	
	The applicant has type-2 diabetes and hypertension which is treated with medication. She was also suffering from what her general practitioner described on 26 August 2016 as “situational stress” relating to the investigation by the AFP of the present offence.
	


The probable effect of the sentence on any of the person’s family or dependants (s 16A(2)(p))


	
	As there is no up-to-date evidence of the situation of the applicant’s family at the time of sentencing it is not possible to determine this factor with any specificity. As the applicant was, for much of the week, the sole carer for her four children who lived at home, the youngest of whom is 8 years old, I assume that her absence is having a considerable emotional effect on the children, and particularly the youngest. However, the evidence does not disclose what their present care arrangements are.
	


Whether sentence of full-time custody required


	
	Having considered these matters, and in particular the nature and gravity of the offence and the need for punishment and general deterrence, I am not satisfied that any sentence other than one which involves full time custody is appropriate in all the circumstances of the case: s 17A.
	


The effect of s 16AC in the present case


	
	I have considered the current grading of the value of the applicant’s undertaking to provide future assistance and the matters as to the provision of such assistance referred to above. But for the promise of future assistance I would have proposed a sentence of 2 years and 4 months imprisonment and directed that the applicant be released after 1 year and 2 months upon entering into a recognisance to be of good behaviour with self-surety of $500. However, in light of the promise of future assistance I propose a sentence of 2 years’ imprisonment and a direction that the applicant be released after 1 year upon entering into a recognisance to be of good behaviour with self-surety of $500. As the applicant has been in custody since 22 May 2017, the sentence ought commence from that date.
	
	
	For the reasons given above, I consider that no lesser sentence (whether in respect of total term or time to be served in custody) is warranted in law: s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act. 
	
	
	I note that s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act provides that, if the sentencing court is of opinion that no less severe sentence is warranted, the court is to dismiss the appeal. Section 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act applies to the applicant’s application for leave to appeal against sentence by reason of s 68(1)(d) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth): Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa (2010) 79 NSWLR 1; [2010] NSWCCA 194 at [10] (Allsop P); and [87] (Basten JA). However, s 6(3) does not displace the obligation imposed on a sentencing judge or court on re-sentence by s 16AC of the Crimes Act to specify, where a sentence has been reduced by reason of an offer of future assistance, what sentence would have been imposed but for the offer. Section 16AC, like s 16A, applies of its own force: see Bui v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) (2012) 244 CLR 638; [2012] HCA 1 at [18]. Any potential inconsistency between s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act (as applied by s 68(1)(d) of the Judiciary Act) and s 16AC of the Crimes Act is resolved in favour of the latter. Where the miscarriage in sentencing discretion has arisen as a consequence of non-compliance with s16AC of the Crimes Act, this Court ought allow the appeal (even if the sentence imposed is, in numerical terms in all respects identical to that imposed by the sentencing judge) and, on re-sentence, ought specify what discount was applied by reason of the offer of future assistance.
	
	
	Although, if the applicant provides the assistance which she has undertaken to give in the future, the resultant sentence will be the same as had the sentence imposed by Delaney ADCJ stood, it is necessary to set it aside in order to state the matters required to be stated by s 16AC and in order to sentence the applicant in accordance with law. It appears that the sentencing judge took into account past and future assistance in a rolled-up discount, but failed to comply with s 16AC. Accordingly, it was not possible to determine from the sentence imposed what it would have been (as required by s 16AC) but for the applicant’s undertaking to give future assistance. This error caused the sentencing discretion to miscarry which required the applicant to be re-sentenced according to law.
	
	
	As referred to above, the sentence imposed by this Court is, in effect, the same as the one imposed by Delaney ADCJ. Where a sentence is relatively short but there is a need for a component of full-time custody for the purposes of general deterrence and punishment, it is not surprising that the re-sentence, based on effectively the same evidence, will be the same or similar to the original sentence.
	


Proposed orders


	
	In these circumstances I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal allowed.
	
	
	In lieu of the sentence imposed by Delaney ADCJ on 22 May 2017, impose a sentence of 2 years’ imprisonment commencing on 22 May 2017.
	
	
	Direct that the applicant be released after serving 1 year, on 21 May 2018 on recognisance to be of good behaviour for 1 year, upon her giving self-surety of $500.
	
	
	Note, pursuant to s 16AC of the Crimes Act 2014 (Cth), that the sentence that would have been imposed but for the applicant’s promise of future assistance, would have been a sentence of 2 years and 4 months’ imprisonment with a direction that the applicant be released on 21 July 2018 on recognisance after serving 1 year and 2 months’ imprisonment, upon her giving self-surety of $500 to be of good behaviour for 1 year and 2 months.

6320468,Harris v R [2017] NSWCCA 254,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


Offences and sentence

The applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court on 9 March 2016 to the following offences:

Count 1 (sequence 8 of the Court Attendance Notice) – Aggravated break, enter and commit serious indictable offence, viz. aggravated robbery, contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) s 112(2) for which the maximum penalty applicable at the time was imprisonment for 20 years. There was no standard non-parole period then applicable. The circumstance of aggravation particularised in the charge was that the applicant used corporal violence on the victim.

Count 2 (sequence 1) – Aggravated sexual assault, contrary to the Crimes Act s  61J(1) for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for 20 years. The circumstance of aggravation was that the applicant occasioned actual bodily harm to the victim.

Form 1 (taken into account on Count 2):


	
	Assault with an act of indecency (sequence 4) contrary to the Crimes Act s  61L for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for 5 years. This was the first of the sexual offences in time, being pulling down the victim’s pyjama pants, rubbing his hands over her back, buttocks and clothing and saying “You're beautiful. Close your eyes”.
	
	
	Sexual intercourse without consent (sequence 10) contrary to the Crimes Act s 61I, s 344A, for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for 14 years. After the attempted sexual intercourse without consent below, and while the victim was on the bed, the applicant pulled her head towards his penis and again forced fellatio on her, for about two or three minutes.
	
	
	Attempted sexual intercourse without consent (sequence 9) contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for 14 years. After the forced fellatio in sequence 1, he told the victim to stand up and turn around. He was about to penetrate her anus with his penis and after she objected he then attempted to penetrate her vagina.
	



	
	The sentence proceedings were heard by her Honour Judge English, sitting in the Wagga Wagga District on 17 June 2016. The applicant was sentenced by her Honour on 21 June 2016.
	
	
	On Count 1 the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months, to date from 14 May 2015 and to expire on 13 November 2019, with a head sentence of 6 years to expire on 13 May 2021.
	
	
	On Count 2, taking into account the three matters on the Form 1, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 8 years, 5 months and 7 days commencing on 14 May 2015 and expiring on 20 October 2023, with a head sentence of 11 years and 3 months expiring on 13 August 2026. The sentence imposed for Count 1 was wholly concurrent with that imposed for Count 2.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal against that sentence on the following ground of appeal.
	


The learned sentencing judge erred in declining to take into account the delay in the offence coming before the Court for sentence.

Factual background


	
	At about 8.45pm on 11 July 1999 the victim, BC, had retired to bed when she heard what she believed to be the sound of a key sliding into the door-lock of her apartment. She was aged 22 at the time. When she got out of bed, she saw a male figure in the doorway. This was the applicant, who was unknown to the victim, and was wearing a balaclava. He said “Don’t scream bitch or I’ll bash you”. The applicant then put his left palm over the victim’s face. The victim saw that he was wearing gloves. When the victim commenced to scream, he said “Don’t scream or I’ll hit you”.
	
	
	The applicant grabbed the victim’s shirt and spun her around so that she was looking towards her bedroom and he was behind her. He pulled her downwards, causing her to fall to the floor. The right side of her cheek struck either the corner of the lounge or the heater. The applicant ordered her to “lie down”.
	
	
	The applicant sat on the victim’s back and straddled her with a leg either side of her body. He said “Righto B, where’s your money?” She asked “Do you know me?” and he replied “Yes, I know you BC”. The applicant then forced the victim into the kitchen where she gave him $70 from her wallet saying “Just take it”.
	
	
	The applicant forced the victim back into the bedroom and pushed her onto the floor so that she lay on her stomach. He said “Have you got any belts?” to which she replied that they were in a cupboard. The applicant said “Stay there. Aren’t you having any visitors tonight?” to which the victim replied “No”. The applicant then asked “Isn’t C coming?” (C was the victim’s boyfriend). The victim replied “No”.
	
	
	The applicant ordered the victim to put her hands behind her back, after which he tied them together using the belts and an article of clothing. He pushed the back of the victim’s head causing her to fall forward and land face down on the bed. The applicant got into bed next to her and lay only centimetres away from her, facing her. The victim said “I don’t want you to hurt me” to which the applicant responded “I’m not going to hurt you”. The applicant started rubbing both his hands over the victim’s back and buttocks and over her clothing. While doing so he was saying “You’re beautiful. Close your eyes”.
	
	
	The applicant turned the victim over so that she was lying on her back and continued to touch her, putting his hands under her singlet top and around her stomach area. He circled her breasts with his hand for about five minutes. The victim was terrified about what might happen next.
	
	
	The applicant said: “If C doesn’t want you, I’ll have you. Don’t you remember a couple of weeks ago you knocked me back?” to which the victim replied “No”. The applicant said “Open your mouth”. The victim complied and the applicant placed his penis entirely inside her mouth. She could feel that his penis was fully erect. The applicant ordered her to suck it and she complied with that demand. The applicant kept pushing his penis into her mouth about five or six times, causing the victim to choke as he pushed his penis further and further into her mouth.
	
	
	The applicant then grabbed the victim’s left arm and pulled her upwards. He sat her up and manoeuvred her so that her legs were dangling over the side of the bed. He ordered her to “keep your eyes shut”. The victim complied. The applicant put his right hand on the back of her head and pulled her head towards his penis and pushed his penis into her mouth again. He forced her to perform fellatio on him for two or three minutes.
	
	
	The applicant suddenly took his penis out of her mouth and ordered the victim to “stand up”. He forced her to kneel on the floor and lie with her chest on the bed. The applicant put both of his hands on either side of the victim’s underpants and pulled them down and ordered her to “lift your knees”. He rubbed his erect penis against her buttocks and said “You feel good”. He did that for a couple of minutes and then got up and left the bedroom.
	
	
	The applicant returned to the bedroom, knelt behind the victim and pressed his erect penis against her vagina. He thrust his penis forward so that the victim felt that it was about to penetrate her anus. She said “Don’t do that”. The applicant responded “Sorry I didn’t mean to hurt you”. He then repositioned his penis and attempted to insert it into her vagina. He thrust his penis forward a number of times but he was unable to penetrate her vagina.
	
	
	The victim heard the applicant rummaging through her cupboards and drawers. She heard the front door open and the sound of running footsteps. The victim lay still for a period of about 10 to 15 minutes and then ran down the side of the residence to gain the attention of her landlord, Mrs K. She kicked at Mrs K’s door screaming “Let me in”. Mrs K was unable to undo the bindings which held the victim’s arms. Mrs K rang the policy and held the phone close to the victim while the victim spoke with police. Eventually the victim’s boyfriend, C, arrived and undid the belts which were restraining her. Shortly afterwards the police and an ambulance arrived.
	
	
	The victim was transported to the Wagga Wagga Base Hospital and a Sexual Assault Kit (SAK) was completed. Swabs were taken from the vulval and vaginal areas and her underpants were retained. As a result of the assault, the victim suffered redness around both wrists from being tied up, a reddened area on her right cheek bone about 6cms by 4cms, swelling to her right cheek, six small red marks on the right side of her abdomen, non-specific red marks on her back, bruises to her right shin, a bruise just above her right knee and soreness to her neck, chest, upper arms and lower back.
	
	
	The SAK was taken to the NSW Police Division of Analytical Laboratories where it was examined. Semen was detected on her underpants. At the time no DNA suspect profiles were identified. On 26 May 2014 a DNA sample was obtained from the applicant while he was in custody in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) for other matters. The DNA sample was analysed and returned a match to the semen profile located on the victim’s underpants.
	
	
	The victim told police that she had never had any prior interaction with the applicant, nor did she have any knowledge of him. On 14 May 2015 a magistrate in the Canberra Magistrates’ Court granted an extradition order, just as the applicant finished serving a sentence of imprisonment in the ACT. The applicant was taken into custody in New South Wales on that day and has remained in custody ever since.
	


Sentence judgment


	
	At the time the applicant came before her Honour, he was aged 49. He had a poor criminal record in the Children’s Court, which included convictions for stealing, forgery, malicious injury, resist arrest, serious alarm and affront on enclosed land, drive in a manner dangerous, seven counts of stealing motor vehicles and one count of break, enter and steal.
	
	
	As an adult the applicant had a similarly poor record including the following convictions in NSW: five counts of break, enter and steal, two counts of stealing a motor vehicle, disqualified driver, larceny of a motor vehicle, driving while unregistered and uninsured, offensive behaviour, sexual assault, indecent assault, possessing cannabis, twenty counts of receiving, four counts of goods in custody, possessing housebreaking implements, possessing equipment for administering a prohibited drug, common assault, speeding offences, contravening a prohibition in an apprehended domestic violence order; stalk or intimidate and entering enclosed lands.
	
	
	The applicant had convictions in the ACT for failing to appear, common assault, theft, possessing a prohibited substance, negligent driving (x 2), damaging property, being an unaccompanied learner, destroying Australian Government property, sexual intercourse without consent and sexual intercourse in the third degree.
	
	
	In 1986 the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 7 years for sexual assault offences, among other matters. He was released to parole in 1996. Her Honour noted that despite that long period of imprisonment, the applicant continued to re-offend.
	
	
	Her Honour took into account a report from Ms Allen, a psychologist, dated 30 May 2016. The report was prepared following a consultation of 3¼ hours. Ms Allen found that the applicant was not suffering from any psychiatric illness at the time of the offending. The most that could be said of him was that his intellectual functioning was below the average range. Her Honour rejected the psychologist’s finding that the offending was “seemingly opportunistic” and unplanned. On that issue, her Honour took into account that the applicant knew the identity of the victim, had met her on a previous occasion, had a key to her apartment and was wearing a balaclava and gloves. Her Honour found, therefore, that there was a degree of planning associated with the offending.
	
	
	Her Honour reviewed the applicant’s previous sexual offending and noted a common theme, i.e. anger on the part of the applicant which seemed to be associated with each episode of offending. The applicant’s sexual offending began while he was in a relationship with a woman from New Zealand, who was returning home, and this angered him. He knew the victim of the first sexual assault who was a gymnastics teacher. The applicant came upon her as she was walking down the street and decided to sexually assault her.
	
	
	Following his release from custody for that offence he was living in Canberra and once again in a relationship with a woman. He was angry that he was not permitted to return to the Tumut area as a result of his earlier offending. He went to meet a friend that evening who did not turn up. This time the victim was a complete stranger. The applicant saw her walking to her vehicle, got into it and sexually assaulted her. On this occasion the applicant again reported that he was angry.
	
	
	The background to the present offending was that he was unemployed, was short of money and his partner had suffered two miscarriages. He said that he decided to break into the victim’s home for financial reasons, that he did not think anyone was at home and that the assault “just happened”. He tied the victim up so she “wouldn’t run away as he searched the place”.
	
	
	Her Honour rejected that explanation as being nothing more than an attempt on the part of the applicant to minimise his moral culpability. On the basis of the matters already referred to, her Honour concluded that the assault on the victim was deliberate. He had been rebuffed by the victim on an earlier occasion and he was angry. Her Honour regarded that as the only reasonable inference which could be drawn when one had regard to his past sexual offending.
	
	
	In relation to objective seriousness and moral culpability, her Honour characterised the offending as follows:
	


“To use old fashioned terminology in the terms of the sexual assaults upon this young woman, they were most reprehensible and disgusting rapes of a young woman who was home alone. What makes it even more heinous is that he had just served a lengthy sentence of imprisonment for an offence of a similar kind.” (Sentence judgment, 11.5)

…

“It was a prolonged series of assaults upon her involving repeated acts of fellatio, attempted penile and anal intercourse. She had been threatened, she was tied up to prevent her escape and indeed even defending herself in any way had that been at all possible.” (Sentence judgment, 13.9)

…

“It is certainly a matter falling at the upper end of the scale constructed for like offences. Had the matter proceeded to trial I would have imposed a head sentence in the order of 15 years imprisonment.

It is always possible to imagine a worst case scenario but it is difficult to imagine a case which would be more culpable than this. The torment, as I have referred to it, I find elevates the seriousness of the offence.” (Sentence judgment, 14.3)


	
	Her Honour noted that the applicant had not only engaged in a series of serious sexual offences but had also committed an aggravated break enter and commit serious indictable offence, namely robbery. By reference to the guideline judgment in R v Ponfield [1999] NSWCCA 435; 48 NSWLR 327 her Honour concluded that this was a serious example of such offending. The applicant was not young nor did he have little by way of criminal antecedents. There was planning and acts of violence against a young woman at home alone. These were residential premises which were broken into at a time when persons could be expected to be at home. Her Honour considered that both specific deterrence and general deterrence had important roles to play in sentencing for these offences.
	
	
	Her Honour was of the opinion that everyone should be able to feel safe and secure in the sanctity of their home and that no-one had the right to break into another person’s home, rob her, sexually assault her and leave her traumatised for the rest of her life.
	
	
	Her Honour gave particular attention to the issue of whether the applicant was likely to re-offend. Given the ground of appeal and the submissions put in its support, it is necessary to set out her Honour’s observations on this subject in greater detail than would otherwise be necessary.
	


“As to whether he is truly remorseful and contrite it is difficult to say. He demonstrates a total of lack of insight, despite years and years of being in gaol. He raped not only this young woman, but two others. He holds some very misguided belief that in some way “maybe it’s their fantasy to be sexually assaulted”. That is simply extraordinary. It shows his absolute lack of insight. Despite being aware whilst he was raping his victims that they were shaking through fear that did not dampen his arousal.

…

He says after he committed these offences that he felt dirty and he felt anxious, “you shut yourself away from the world for a week or two, you never do get over it, it stays with you always there at the back of your mind”.

Clearly what stays with him in the back of his mind is the risk of being caught, which has occurred over and over again.

It is difficult in those circumstances to sever any remorse from self-interest. Yet despite being caught and spending lengthy periods of time in custody he has continued to reoffend as I said.

What is of great concern is that in the opinion of the psychologist he is at high risk of reoffending. As I have already said specific deterrence looms large in any penalty to be imposed, retribution, deterrence, and more importantly protection of society warrant the imposition of a more serious penalty.

This offender’s continuing reoffending in this most serious of ways demonstrates a continuing disobedience of the law and a total disregard for the rights of others. What is also obvious is that he needs to attend a sex offender’s programme to help him gain insight into the impact of his offending behaviour towards women and to learn just how incorrect his thinking is.

He says he wants to attend such a programme so “he can get on with his life”. It would instil more confidence in his victims and the community if his intention was to assist him to refrain from behaving in this way again and develop the insight into the reason why he sexually assaulted these women.

…

I find his prospects for rehabilitation are extremely guarded and I find unless he commits to attending and fully participating in a sex offenders’ programme he is highly likely to reoffend. Only sentences of full time custody will suffice.” (Sentence judgment, 16.9 – 18.3)


	
	In relation to “special circumstances” her Honour said:
	


“I am asked to make a finding of special circumstances. I decline to do so. The sentences to be imposed will be significant and hence there will be lengthy periods of parole sufficient to ensure that he is supervised to such an extent that hopefully he will be deterred from reoffending in this manner again.

…

The delay in the matter coming before the Court for sentence is raised on his behalf as a factor of mitigation. The DNA sample was not taken until May 2014, extradition was applied for and the offender returned to New South Wales upon completion of the sentence he was serving in the Australian Capital Territory at the time.

It was always open to him of course to come forward and to admit his guilt and to hand himself in in light of his knowing in the back of his mind that he always ran the risk of being detected, arrested and imprisoned. It is not a matter I have taken into account.” (Sentence judgment, 18.6 – 19.2)

The appeal


	
	The applicant submitted that the relevance of delay to sentencing could arise at a number of levels. He submitted that in this case it was relevant to the progress of his rehabilitation during the period of delay and was relevant to whether a finding of special circumstances should be made. The applicant submitted that it was not sufficient for her Honour to simply say that delay “is not something I have taken into account”.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that her Honour erred by improperly curtailing the exercise of her sentencing discretion in two ways:
	



	
	By not taking into account the fact that the applicant had not sexually re-offended since 1999 when forming a view about his likelihood of re-offending and;
	
	
	By not taking into account the delay as a factor relevant to whether “special circumstances” exist so as to justify a variation in the statutory ratio between the non-parole period (NPP) and the full term of the sentence.
	



	
	The applicant submitted that it was relevant to an assessment of the likelihood of re-offending in a similar manner, whether a person has in fact re-offended in that way during the passage of many years between the offence and the date of sentence. The applicant submitted that when considering the likelihood of re-offending for an offender whose offences were committed many years ago, it was fact rather than prediction and speculation which was to be preferred when assessing the offender’s progress towards rehabilitation.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that great emphasis was placed by her Honour (properly) upon his multiple convictions for sexual assaults of women in the past and the fact that the present offence occurred after he was released from custody in relation to those earlier offences. He submitted that where her Honour erred was in not mentioning at all the lapse of time from 1999 to the date of sentence and taking that into account when considering whether he was likely to re-offend.
	
	
	In relation to special circumstances, the applicant accepted that her Honour was not obliged to find special circumstances by virtue of the delay of over 16 years between the commission of the offence and the imposition of sentence. He accepted that this was a matter for the sentencing judge’s discretion. The applicant’s complaint, however, was that he was entitled to have the discretion properly exercised at law. The applicant submitted that he was entitled to know why in the light of the decision in R v EGC [2005] NSWCCA 392, her Honour had not taken delay into account as a special circumstance entitling him to a variation in the statutory ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period.
	


Consideration


	
	The law in relation to delay and what use can be made of it was succinctly stated in Elchiekh v R [2016] NSWCCA 225 by Price J (with whom Button and Fagan JJ agreed) where his Honour said:
	


“56   Delay may be taken into account in favour of an offender: firstly, when it relates to the uncertain suspense in which a person may be left; secondly, when there is demonstrated progress of the offender towards rehabilitation during the intervening period; and thirdly, because sentencing for a stale crime calls for a measure of understanding and flexibility of approach: R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517 (“Todd”); R v Blanco [1999] NSWCCA 121; (1999) 106 A Crim R 303 at [16]. Where delay is relied upon as a mitigating factor, the onus is upon the offender on the balance of probabilities: Sabra v R [2015] NSWCCA 38 at [47].

…

58   It is well settled that the Todd principle does not apply to a state of suspense or uncertainty experienced by an offender who remains silent and hopes that his offending will remain undetected: R v Hathaway [2005] NSWCCA 368 at [43]; R v Shorten [2005] NSWCCA 106 at [19]; R v Spiers [2008] NSWCCA 107 at [37]-[38]. It makes little sense that an offender who could bring to an end any anxiety by contacting police but chooses to say or do nothing can benefit from inaction by a reduction in sentence. In R v Kay [2004] NSWCCA 130, McColl JA (with whom Levine and Hidden JJ agreed) said at [33]:

“Rather, the applicant was content to remain silent, hoping, presumably, that his association with the October 2001 offence would not be detected. Having remained silent, he now argues that he ought, in effect, be rewarded for his successful concealment of his commission of the offence by a substantially reduced or even deferred sentence. The authorities make plain that the significance of the delay will turn on the circumstances of each case. In my view the circumstances of this case do not attract the Todd principle.””


	
	It is clear why her Honour made no reference to the absence of any sexual offending between 1999 and May 2015 as a factor which could be taken into account when considering the applicant’s rehabilitation and prospects of re-offending. It was because a submission to that effect was not put to her Honour in the sentence proceedings. As this Court has said on many occasions, sentence proceedings are not to be regarded as a trial run for a subsequent appeal. Submissions, if they are to be relied upon on appeal, should be put at the sentence proceedings. It is fundamentally unfair to assert that a sentencing judge has erred in failing to take into account a factor when that factor was never put to the judge in the sentence proceedings.
	
	
	In Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 Johnson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Rothman J agreed) said on this issue:
	


“79   This Court is a court of error. The jurisdiction of the Court to interfere with a sentencing decision is exercisable only where there can be seen to have been an error of principle, or some other mistake of fact or law: R v Visconti [1982] 2 NSWLR 104 at 108. If material error is demonstrated, before the Court would proceed to resentence the Applicant, the Court must form a positive opinion that some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed: s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912; R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 at 720-721 [79]. It is, of course, a basic principle that, absent error, the Court of Criminal Appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing Judge merely because (if it be the case) the Court would have exercised its discretion in a manner different from the manner in which the sentencing Judge exercised his or her discretion: Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665 at 671-672 [15].

80   There is a practical expectation that an offender's legal representative will make submissions to the sentencing Judge at first instance, by reference to the particular factors which are sought to be taken into account in mitigation of sentence in the case at hand: Edwards v R [2009] NSWCCA 199 at [11]; Dyer v R [2011] NSWCCA 185 at [49]. It might be thought that defence counsel would have ample opportunity to consider whether an argument concerning possible summary disposal should be made in the District Court, given that the acceptance of a plea of guilty to a lesser charge usually follows charge negotiations, as occurred in this case. The fact that a less serious charge is to proceed (and its consequences) would be at the forefront of counsel's thinking.

81   The Victorian Court of Appeal has emphasised recently, that in sentencing appeals, the Court is reviewing the exercise of a discretionary judgment and not rehearing a plea of mitigation. It is not the occasion for the revision and reformulation of the case presented below. The Court will not lightly entertain arguments that could have been put, but were not advanced on the plea, and will have an even greater reluctance to entertain arguments that seek to resile from concessions made below or are a contradiction of submissions previously made. The Court spoke of the need for exceptional circumstances before this can be done, where it can be shown that there was most compelling material available on the plea that was not used or understood, and which demonstrates that there has been a miscarriage of justice arising from the plea and sentence: Romero v R [2011] VSCA 45 at [11]; Keane v R [2011] VSCA 156 at [13],[18]; Bayram v R [2012] VSCA 6 at [28]-[29].

82   In rare circumstances, a factor which may operate in mitigation of penalty (and which appears clearly from the material before the sentencing Judge) may have been overlooked by defence counsel and the sentencing Judge. In such a case, this Court may be invited to have regard to it, often in circumstances where the Crown will accept that the relevant material raised a factor which should unequivocally operate in the offender's favour on sentence. As Warren CJ said in Bayram v R at [29], it may ""render a serious injustice"" if an offender was not able to correct the error in such a case. This approach reflects the primacy of the rule that appeal grounds should relate to arguments put, and decisions made, at first instance. At the same time, criminal appellate courts should be able to correct a miscarriage of justice, or serious injustice, in the clear and rare cases where the relevant matter has not been relied upon at first instance.”


	
	It also needs to be kept in mind that the offending which was being considered by her Honour was not restricted only to sexual misconduct. The aggravated break and enter was also under consideration. It is clear from the applicant’s offending in the ACT since 1999 that he continued to have anger issues. His convictions include offences of assault, contravening an ADVO, stalking and threatening to kill.
	
	
	In oral submissions it was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the absence of sexual offending between 1999 and May 2015 was so obvious that there was no need for counsel to specifically refer to that matter in the sentence proceedings. I do not agree. The issue relied upon by the applicant involved a discrete aspect of delay and it should have been put to her Honour in that context in the sentence proceedings.
	
	
	Moreover, it is clear from her Honour’s detailed analysis of the evidence which was before her and addressed by counsel in the sentence proceedings, that she had reached a conclusion as to rehabilitation and prospects of re-offending which was adverse to the applicant. The addition of the factor now relied upon, while relevant to such a consideration, does not answer any of the particular matters identified by her Honour.
	
	
	This was the applicant’s third episode and fourth conviction for sexual assault. They were all offences of a most reprehensible and disgusting type. The applicant’s thinking concerning this kind of offending was clearly disordered as of the date of sentencing as was set out by Ms Allen in her report:
	


“29   With regard to his sexual offences in general he said “What I don’t understand is they orgasmed”. He considered that “maybe it’s their fantasy, to be sexually assaulted but not hurt”. However, he denied that this belief was linked to his decision to assault them and acknowledged that this was driven by his own desire to do so. Within this discussion he noted the general tendency to consider whether he would like to have sex with women he came across. He described physical attributes of women he was attracted to and those he was not.”


	
	Ms Allen set out the results of the tests which she had carried out to assess the risk of sexual re-offending in the applicant. Her conclusion was that the results “places him in the high risk category relative to other male sexual offenders”.
	
	
	Her Honour in her analysis of the psychological report identified the lack of insight demonstrated by the applicant and in particular his focus on himself, rather than on his victims and the inevitable effect his conduct would have had upon them. The apparent lack of sexual offending between 1999 and May 2015 did not answer any of those findings by her Honour.
	
	
	Moreover, the factor relied upon by the applicant in this appeal was specifically considered and answered by Ms Allen in her report.
	


“53   Mr Harris’ Static-99R assessment placed him in the high risk group for re-offending. This tool does not account for changes over time. Mr Harris reported that he has recognised the impact of his offending on the victims since the birth of his daughter which may serve to ameliorate his risk. I believe he has not been arrested for a sexual offence since her birth. However his report of his more recent sexual behaviour suggests an ongoing proclivity to sexualise women and engage in impersonal sexual relations. This, and his recent violence indicating difficulties interacting with others and managing his behaviour, suggests an ongoing risk of further sexual offending broadly consistent with the Static-99R.”

It follows that although her Honour did not specifically refer to this factor, it was effectively dealt with and its importance nullified in the report of Ms Allen which was relied upon by the applicant and which her Honour, except for one issue, accepted. The absence of sexual offending during the delay period was therefore not a matter of significance.


	
	If I am wrong in approaching the matter in that way and there was error in her Honour failing to take into account the lack of sexual offending since 1999, it would not cause me to reduce the sentence imposed by her Honour. There has been no other challenge to any factual finding by her Honour. Accordingly, taking those findings into account in my independent assessment, pursuant to s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) and applying the principles set out in Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601 at [35], [42]-[43] I have concluded that no lesser sentence is warranted in law. This is particularly so when regard is had to the applicant’s disordered mode of thinking, his lack of insight and the high risk of re-offending established by Ms Allen’s psychological testing.
	
	
	In oral submissions on resentence, it was submitted that on the issue of totality the Court should have regard to the applicant’s period of custody in the ACT for the offences previously referred to. The applicant submitted that the application of Mill v R [1988] HCA 70; 166 CLR 59 required that the applicant’s total effective period in custody should be taken into account when imposing a sentence for the offences presently under consideration.
	
	
	There are two difficulties with that submission. The first is that in the sentence proceedings, the applicant’s counsel requested that the commencement date for the present sentences be backdated to 14 May 2015. In accordance with that request, her Honour fixed that as the starting date for the sentence. The second difficulty is that making the offence of break, enter and commit robbery wholly concurrent with the aggravated sexual assault offence involved considerable leniency given the different criminality involved in those offences. Accordingly, the totality principle was adequately given effect to.
	
	
	In relation to special circumstances, it is not correct to say that her Honour failed to take into account the extent of delay. Her Honour clearly took it into account or she would not have referred to it. What her Honour was, in effect, saying was that she declined to give that factor any weight by way of mitigation in this case. Her Honour did not err in doing so.
	
	
	It is not correct to characterise these offences as “stale”. For the reasons already referred to, and as set out in her Honour’s judgment, this was not a case where rehabilitation had occurred and the community was not at risk. As can be seen from the victim impact statement of BC, the effects of the applicant’s offending continue to adversely influence her life. It was the applicant’s failure to come forward which was the sole cause of delay. In those circumstances, it was well open to her Honour in accordance with what was said in R v Kay [2004] NSWCCA 130 to refuse to make a finding of special circumstances in favour of the applicant. Her Honour gave clear and compelling reasons for why she had reached that conclusion. The sentence which she was going to impose was a substantial one so that in accordance with the statutory ratio, there was going to be ample time for supervision for the applicant on parole. There was simply no basis for altering the statutory ratio so as to reduce the non-parole period applicable to the applicant.
	


Conclusion


	
	The orders which I propose are that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.
	
	
	BEECH-JONES J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
	
	
	N ADAMS J: I agree that leave to appeal should be granted but the appeal dismissed for the reasons given by Hoeben CJ at CL.

		01 November 2017",2017-10-31 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
6320622,R v Michael Phillip Martin; R v Candace Martin [2017] NSWSC 1106,"Judgment


	
	Michael Phillip Martin and Candace Martin stand jointly charged on an indictment containing five counts as follows:
	



	
	Attempted murder of Michael Anthony Martin on 7 April 2014 (accused charged jointly).
	
	
	In the alternative to (1) and against Candace Martin only, accessory after the fact to count (1).
	
	
	Causing grievous bodily harm to Edmund Manning with intent to cause grievous bodily harm on 7 April 2014 (accused charged jointly).
	
	
	Murder of Michael Anthony Martin on 13 June 2014 (accused charged jointly).
	
	
	In the alternative to (4) and against Candace Martin only, accessory after the fact to count (4).
	



	
	In view of the similarity in the name of the male accused and the alleged victim of counts (1) and (4), who are father and son, I will refer to them as “Mr Martin” and “the deceased”.
	
	
	Previously, there was a third accused on the indictment, a young woman called Jessica Honey Fallon. She was charged with the attempted murder of the deceased on 7 April 2014 and the infliction of grievous bodily harm on Mr Manning on the same date. Both Ms Fallon and Ms Martin made applications for orders separating their trials from the trial of Mr Martin. Those applications came before Latham J on 15 and 23 June 2017. Ultimately, the Crown consented to the separation of Ms Fallon’s trial and her Honour made orders accordingly.
	
	
	On 23 June 2017, her Honour was told that Candace Martin’s separate trial application turned on a ruling as to the admissibility of certain evidence which the Crown seeks to lead as an admission on the part of Candace Martin. The admission is said to arise by virtue of Candace Martin’s failure to refute an admission by Mr Martin made in a letter he wrote to her in late February or early March of 2015. There seems to be no dispute that the letter is admissible in Mr Martin’s case. The parties and her Honour agreed that it was a matter that should be dealt with by the trial Judge. The trial is due to commence in Lismore on 28 August 2017 and I am to preside over the trial.
	
	
	The matter came before me on 3 August 2017. Candace Martin asked to be arraigned and entered pleas of not guilty to the three substantive charges (counts 1, 3 and 4) but entered pleas of guilty to the two accessory charges (counts 2 and 5). Evidence was tendered on the evidentiary issue and the separate trial application. The parties provided written submissions and oral arguments were heard on that day. The matter was adjourned until 22 August 2017 for decision on the separate trial application and the admissibility issue. Further submissions were made on 22 August 2017 concerning the impact of Candace Martin’s pleas of guilty to the accessory after the fact charges.
	
	
	On the hearing of the separate trial application on 3 August 2017, counsel for Mr Martin indicated that he did not seek to be heard on the application, stating that he had no “dog in the flight”, and asked to be excused because he was appearing in another trial. He was not present when Candace Martin entered the pleas of guilty to the accessory charges, although I proceeded on the basis that both Mr Martin and his lawyers were aware that she would do so. In this context, his neutrality on the issue of separate trials was surprising.
	
	
	On the day the matter was listed for judgment (that is, today, 22 August 2017), I called for further submissions on the question of the impact of Candace Martin’s pleas of guilty on the trial of Mr Martin. Counsel for Mr Martin submitted that the counts of accessory after the fact to murder should be severed from the indictment. He submitted that it would be confusing to the jury, and unfair on Mr Martin, to have the jury hear Candace Martin enter those pleas of guilty because the pleas contained an admission that Mr Martin was guilty of the substantive charges. The Crown opposed any order for severance. Candace Martin also opposed an order for severance. Both the Crown and Candace Martin took the view that severance might operate unfairly to Candace Martin. She wishes to have the jury hear her pleas of guilty so that it is clear, in her case and from the outset, that she acknowledges her guilt on those charges but denies being part of any joint criminal enterprise to murder the decease. Mr Martin accepted that if the trials were separated, the application for severance would fall away.
	


An overview of the facts and the evidence tendered on the application

The case of each of the parties


	
	The prosecution case is that the two accused entered into a joint criminal enterprise to murder the deceased, who was Mr Martin’s father. Mr Martin took out insurance policies on his father’s life. By 24 February 2014 there were two life insurance policies in the amounts of $1.5 million (payable to the deceased’s estate, of which Mr Martin was one of three beneficiaries) and $1 million (payable to Mr Martin). Candace Martin is (or was) Mr Martin’s wife and the Crown case is that she also stood to gain financially from the murder.
	
	
	On or about 7 April 2014, [1]  there was an attempt on the deceased’s life. The Crown case is that the accused procured Ms Fallon to carry out the murder and that Ms Fallon and Mr Martin were present. [2]  The deceased was stabbed several times when he opened the door of his home. In the course of the attempt to kill the deceased, Mr Manning was seriously injured.
	
	
	The prosecution case is that Mr Martin killed the deceased on 13 June 2014 by stabbing him on a number of occasions.
	
	
	It is the prosecution case that the two accused acted in concert. Accordingly, each is responsible for the acts of the other and (generally speaking) evidence of acts carried out in furtherance of the common purpose is admissible against each of them. It is axiomatic that co-accused charged in such circumstances are ordinarily to be tried together.
	
	
	Candace Martin’s case, reflected in the pleas that she entered on 3 August 2017, is that she became aware of her husband’s actions after the murder and that she is not criminally liable for the substantive offences but is guilty of being an accessory after the fact of each of the substantive charges in which the deceased was the victim.
	
	
	The precise content of Mr Martin’s defence is not known. However, it appears that his defence involves a denial of involvement in the events of 7 April and that he was a victim, along with the deceased, of the violence on 13 June 2014. The Crown Case Statement provides details of things he said to police after his father was killed. This included version of events to the effect that he and his father were victims of a home invasion in which his father was killed and he assaulted, bound with tape and hit to the head. A witness came upon Mr Martin who had “gaffer” tape over his eyes and binding his wrists and legs. He was making a muffled cry for help. Once the tape was removed, Mr Martin said “Oh my dad is up there, they got my dad.” The Crown case is that this was staged.
	


The evidence on the application


	
	The prosecution tendered four documents on the separate trial application:
	


Ex VD A1 - A text message sent from Candace Martin to Mr Martin on 14 February 2000.

Ex VD A3 - The transcript of a telephone call between the accused on 3 April 2015.

Exhibit VD B – A Crown Case Statement prepared after the separation of the trial of Mr Fallon.


	
	The three documents comprising Ex VD A were originally attached to the written submissions of the learned Crown Prosecutor (MFI 1).
	
	
	Candace Martin read an affidavit of the instructing solicitor, Mr Bell, and this included the following annexures:

(M) Transcript of a listening device recording of a conversation between Candace Martin and a Queensland undercover police officer recorded on 9 April 2015.


	
	The written submissions of counsel for Candace Martin became MFI 2.
	
	
	While all of the detail of the evidence that the Crown intends to adduce is not known, it seems to be clear from a perusal of the material tendered on the pre-trial issue that there will be a substantial amount of evidence which is common to both trials. Equally, it is apparent that there will be substantial bodies of evidence adduced by the prosecution, which is admissible against one accused only and not against the other. On 22 August 2017 counsel for Mr Martin indicated that he would apply for a view of the scene of both crimes and the Crown said that this course was not opposed. Given her admissions as to Mr Martin’s involvement, it seems unlikely that a view would be necessary or desirable in a trial of Candace Martin alone.
	
	
	I am unable to accept a submission by her barrister that the case against Candace Martin is purely based on admissions she allegedly made to various people. It is certainly true that the Crown will place particular reliance on such evidence in the case against her. However, as I perceive it, the Crown will also rely on a body of circumstantial evidence including evidence of the actions of Mr Martin. The full extent of the common evidence is not known because the parties did not tender all of the material upon which the Crown will rely and neither counsel identified all of the common evidence or the evidence admissible only against one of the accused. However, the parties seems to agree that the Crown Case Statement and the material attached to the affidavit in support of the notice of motion is sufficient to understand the nature of the case against each accused for the purpose of the present application.
	
	
	The parties were jointly of the view that the merit of the separate trial application hinged to a greater or lesser degree on the admissibility against Candace Martin of an admission contained in a letter sent to her by Mr Martin.
	
	
	However, the Crown submitted that, even if that evidence is not admissible against Candace Martin as an admission, it may nevertheless be tendered at her trial and be subject to directions as to its use. If the letter was said to be inadmissible against her altogether, the jury could receive (and would obey) a direction that this particular part of the evidence can only be used against Mr Martin and must not be used in considering the case against Candace Martin. Alternatively, if the evidence was held to be admissible on some basis other than as an admission (a matter to which I will return), the jury would receive (and obey) directions as to the limitations on its use, including a direction that it could not be used as an admission by Candace Martin. In either event, the Crown submits that the case should proceed as a joint trial.
	
	
	Counsel for Candace Martin submitted that his client could not receive a fair trial if the evidence was not admissible against her (or admissible on some basis other than as an admission) and that it would be impossible for a jury to disregard the letter if it was called upon to consider the letter as an admission in the case of Mr Martin. Whilst this was an important aspect of the separate trial application, counsel also relied on an assertion that the case against his client was substantially different (and weaker) than the case against Mr Martin. Nevertheless, he seemed to accept that if the letter was admissible as an admission by Candace Martin, the separate trial would probably fail.
	


THE ADMISSIBILITY ISSUE

The admission to which objection is taken


	
	To appreciate the arguments put on both sides as to whether the letter from Mr Martin to Candace Martin is admissible as an admission by or against Candace Martin, it will be necessary to set out that letter in full. It is a nine page closely typed document which chronicles the lengthy history of the relationship between husband and wife including its many ups and downs. It culminates with a plea for reconciliation. On page 7 of the letter, Mr Martin wrote:
	


“I guess we never really got better after that. Money got tighter and we had another bright idea to free our lives up more. I wouldn’t have to work so hard and therefore worry less. You and I would finally be able to have the things in life we ever wanted. Plans were set and everything seemed perfect. Our biggest problem is that we are too good at heart. Our guilt has stuck since the moment we concocted our bright idea. Looking back, if I could have seen the ramifications on our marriage, there is no way I would have considered it, but again, they have to live with my choices.

After that trip to Nanna and Pa’s and that night therafter, I feel so guilty, but not for what happened but for the way I let myself lose control. 25 years of torture from these people led me to do the unthinkable. I let myself lose control and it scared me. Not at what I did but the mere fact that the animal side got the better of me. I know for a fact that I can control myself every other time. But for those few minutes, I let my emotions control everything I did and the result could be seen. I was a very hurt man who had been hurt by the very person who should have loved me the most but caused me so much pain.”


	
	Based on the surrounding circumstances, the timing of events and the content of the letter, this part of the letter is capable of being relied on by the Crown as an admission by Mr Martin of his involvement in his father’s death. However, it is the prosecution case that the first paragraph quoted above involves an assertion by Mr Martin that Candace Martin was a party to the plan to kill the deceased. The prosecution relies on words such as “we concocted a bright idea” and “our guilt has stuck” to advance the argument that the reference to the fact that “plans were set” is a reference to the joint plans of both accused.
	
	
	As I understand it, the evidence is silent as to when the letter was written and sent. However, on 3 March 2015 Candace Martin sent a text message to Mr Martin in the following terms: –
	


“I got your letter and read it. I can’t ... Too much to deal with. Life needs to be more simple. You may see it as running. Its not. Its self preserving. I can’t let into my head or heart again. I have put it behind me. You are right, our love is deep. But has destroyed me. I have picked up the pieces. I would rather be with a person who barely scratches the surface than someone who can hurt me so deeply. I ultimately just want to be alone. Kids need me. They are everything. I have hurt you and I am so sorry. I can’t trust you, or anyone, not to hurt me again. I won’t give anyone that power.” [3] 


	
	The prosecution case is that this text message refers to the letter sent by Mr Martin. Candace Martin submits that there is an element of speculation in that proposition. I accept that submission but, for present purposes, I will act on an assumption that the text message refers back to the letter. If admitted, that would be a question for the jury to resolve.
	


Is the evidence admissible to prove an admission?


	
	The prosecution submits that the failure of Candace Martin to deny the suggestion or implication on page 7 of the letter that the plan to kill the deceased was a joint one, is evidence by which the jury could conclude that Candace Martin accepted the proposition. In other words, her silence in the face of the letter constitutes an admission by her that the contents of the letter, and the inferences to be drawn from those contents, were accepted by her. Thus, her silence can be used as an admission that she and her husband had a “bright idea” involving a joint plan to kill the deceased and that, as a result, their (joint) “guilt has stuck”.
	
	
	Paragraph 27 of the Crown’s written submission states:
	


“It is submitted that it is well established that a failure to deny an accusatory statement in circumstances where some denial or explanation could reasonably be expected can amount to an admission by conduct or tacit admission. (R v Freeman, unreported NSWCCA 18/12/86).”


	
	The facts of Freeman were quite different. That case involved the failure of a public solicitor on a bail application to deny (on the accused’s behalf) certain allegations ventilated before a magistrate. Ultimately, the Court of Criminal Appeal held that the evidence of the solicitor’s failure to contradict the asserted facts was not admissible as a tacit admission by silence. Its admission caused the trial to miscarry. However, the decision turned on its facts and the following passage in the judgment of Street CJ is relevant to the question of admissibility that arises in the present case:
	


“It is of course well established that, where an accusatory statement is made in the presence of an accused person, it is not evidence against him of the facts stated except in so far as he accepts it. Acceptance may be by way of word, conduct, action or demeanour. Whether there is acceptance is a matter for the jury. A mere denial by an accused does not render the statement inadmissible but its evidential value when he denies it is limited and the judge may well think it proper to exclude such evidence. Where failure to deny it is relied upon, it is necessary to ensure that, before any such evidence is admitted, the circumstances are such as to leave it fairly open to conclude that silence is such as to convey a tacit admission of the truth of what is being asserted. This will, of course, require consideration of whether the circumstances were such that some denial or explanation might reasonably be expected.”


	
	Counsel also took me to the Victorian case of R v MMJ [2006] VSCA 226. That was a case of child sexual assault. The victim was the child of the accused. The Crown led evidence from the mother of the child (and wife of the accused) that the accused remained silent when she put a number of questions to him. She said “he ignored a lot of my questions” and he “would only answer questions that he wanted to answer.” The Court was divided over the issue of admissibility and the question of whether his silence or selective answering of questions ought to have been left to the jury as an admission. Warren CJ took the view that the evidence was admissible and set out her reasons at [15]-[20]. Her Honour relied (at [18]) on the following passage from the judgment of Isaacs J in R v Grills (1910) 11 CLR 400; [1910] HCA 68:
	


""It is an elementary rule of law, going to the very foundation of justice, that no man shall be adjudged to be guilty of a crime upon evidence of another person’s previous assertions. It matters not whether the assertion was made in the absence or the presence of the accused, as a mere assertion it cannot be regarded as any proof of the culpability of the accused or any confirmation of his accusers. But it is evident that upon such an assertion being made, and equally whether in the accused’s absence or presence, he may admit its truth, and if he does, then it becomes evidence against him of his guilt, not because another has said it, but because of the admission. It is then equivalent to his own statement, and is receivable in that character. And it is further manifest that the acknowledgment of its correctness may be made in an infinite variety of ways. There may be express and unqualified admission, or there may be a guarded admission, or there may be no direct but merely an implied acknowledgement or there may be conduct, active or passive, positive or negative, from which, having regard to the ordinary workings of human nature, a total denial may be considered by reasonable men to be precluded, because, if innocence existed, an unequivocal or a qualified denial would in such a situation be expected.""


	
	Buchanan and Ashley JJA, in separate judgments, took a different approach. Buchanan JA said at [53] that the reception of the evidence and the prominence that it took in the trial was “extremely prejudicial to the applicant” and that “the generality of the evidence deprived it of any significant probative effect.” Ashley JA took the view at [85] that the evidence may have been admissible as part of the “relationship” between the parties but doubted that it was evidence of an admission to any particular allegation. His Honour referred to the well-known statement by Windeyer J in Woon v The Queen (1964) 109 CLR 529; [1964] HCA 23 at 541:
	


“A question asked of a person accused or suspected of a crime, or a statement made in his presence, is admissible if he is invited to, or might reasonably be expected to, respond in some way indicative of denial or of acceptance. It is not that what is said to the accused can of itself be evidence against him. But his response or reaction may be; and that is why what is said to him is admitted. His words, silence or conduct may amount to an admission of the truth of what was said. This is subject to the qualification that no inference adverse to a man can be drawn from his refusal to answer questions which he has been expressly told he is not bound to answer or from his silence after he has been told he need not speak at all.”


	
	In addition to the two authorities referred to by the parties, I have also considered the civil cases of Mundey v Askin [1982] 2 NSWLR 369 and Thatcher v Charles (1961) 104 CLR 57; [1961] HCA 5.
	
	
	In Mundey v Askin, the Court (Moffit P, Reynolds and Samuel JJA) said at 373:
	


“We think that the principle is as stated by Bowen LJ in Wiedemann v Walpole [1891] 2 QB 534, at 539: –

‘Silence is not evidence of an admission, unless there are circumstances which render it more reasonably probable that a man would answer the charge made against him, than that he would not.’

(and see Young v Tibbits (1912) 14 CLR 114 and R v Newman (1852) 1 El & B1 268; 118 ER 437.)”


	
	In Thatcher v Charles, the High Court was concerned with whether the silence of a civil litigant could be used against him in a driving case. Fullagar J (with whom Kitto J agreed) set out the relevant matter of principle in the context of the alleged admissions as follows:
	


“The conversations in question were two. The first took place at some unspecified time before the accident. There was evidence that Thatcher was in the habit of riding a motor cycle about the community housing centre in which the accident occurred, and evidence (which I should have thought clearly inadmissible) that he rode it in a dangerous manner. The father and mother of the plaintiff deposed that on one occasion the father (who was chopping wood at the time) said to Thatcher in the presence of the mother: ""If you run over one of my children, I will put this hatchet through you."" To this, it was said, Thatcher made no reply. The two versions of what was said are not identical, but the difference is immaterial.

This evidence was, in my opinion, clearly inadmissible. It was put that it conveyed to the defendant a warning of the fact that children frequented the area. But this appears to me to be an altogether unreal view. Neither the purport of what the father said, nor the purpose of its being tendered in evidence seems to me to have had any genuine relation to the knowledge of the defendant that children frequented the place of the accident. The evidence went to show that the defendant was in the habit of riding his motor cycle so recklessly as to provoke an emphatic protest from an observer. This was quite irrelevant matter, and the only possible way in which its introduction could really advance the plaintiff's case or damage the defendant's case was by creating prejudice in the minds of the jury by conveying the impression that the defendant was an habitually reckless driver of motor vehicles. In that aspect it could be very damaging indeed to the defendant, but it had no real bearing on any issue in the case, and it ought, in my opinion, to have been excluded.

The other conversation took place shortly after the accident between the plaintiff's mother and the defendant. According to the plaintiff's mother, she said to the defendant: ""Why did you do it? You drive too fast around here. We have always said you would collect somebody."" To this, she said, the defendant made no reply. This evidence also was, in my opinion, inadmissible. This is a civil case and not a criminal case, but even in a civil case I do not think, generally speaking, that evidence of statements made to a person and not denied by him is admissible unless it is fairly open to a jury to infer an admission of a relevant fact from the silence of that person. Here it was, I think, out of the question for the jury to infer any admission. What was said (apart from the introductory question) did not relate to the specific occasion in question.” [My italics].


	
	It is implicit in the italicised portion of Fullagar J’s judgment that such evidence might more readily be admitted in a civil case than in a criminal case. However, the principles are the same.
	
	
	These cases demonstrate that the question of when silence in the face of an accusation might be construed to be an admission will turn on all of the circumstances. The question, ultimately, is whether the circumstances and the nature of the accusation or statement were such that a denial would be expected or, where the case is being tried by a jury, whether it would be open to the jury to decide that a denial would be expected because the failure to respond to, or deny, the accusation is a tacit admission by the accused person.
	
	
	It is in that context that it is necessary to consider that the particular passage upon which the Crown seeks to rely falls towards the end of a lengthy and discursive piece of correspondence detailing many other facts and circumstances. To appreciate that, it is necessary to consider the entirety of the letter. The full text is included as an annexure to this judgment.
	
	
	It is then necessary to consider Candace Martin’s response in her text message of 3 March 2015. She said that she had received the letter (again, assuming it is the same letter) and that she had read it. However, she said it is “too much to deal with” and does not respond to any of its substantive parts (apart from indicating she wants to be alone to look after the children). Given the length of the letter, it is impossible to conclude that the particular admission and implication was clear to her at the time. I accept that when the matter was brought to her attention by investigating police she understood the implication, but that does not address the question of whether the nature of her texted response was such that a denial was to be expected.
	
	
	I am unable to conclude that it would be reasonable to infer an admission by silence from Candace Martin’s failure to refute the contents of the particular passages relied upon. Even those passages are somewhat ambiguous in their nature, although I accept that it would be open to the jury to conclude that they constitute an admission on the part of Mr Martin.
	
	
	This case is very different from cases where an accused person is confronted with accusations in person and either fails to deny those accusations or chooses to respond selectively.
	
	
	Accepting that the evidence passes the threshold test of relevance in ss 56-56 of the Evidence Act, I am of the opinion that the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger that it might be unfairly prejudicial to Candace Martin or may be misleading: s 135 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). I am also of the view that the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to Candace Martin: s 137 Evidence Act.
	
	
	For those reasons the evidence of the contents of the letter (and the reply by text message) is not admissible to prove an admission on the part of Candace Martin.
	


Is the evidence otherwise admissible and, if so, in what form?


	
	The Crown submits that the evidence is admissible on another basis. The Crown points to evidence that establishes that Candace Martin took steps on Mr Martin’s behalf to remove the letter from his office on around 1 April 2015 and that she lied about her knowledge of the letter (and the steps she took to retrieve it) when interviewed by police on 9 April 2015.
	
	
	In a telephone call at 14:40 on 1 April 2015 the two accused were recorded having the following discussion over the telephone:
	


“Mr Martin:    No, it’s all right, just you know want to get home, yeah, so did you arm, did you get that letter from work?

Candace:    What letter?

Mr Martin:    The psychiatric letter.

Candace:    Oh no I haven’t. I will, get that for you.

Mr Martin:    Can you make sure, like even today.

Candace:    Yeah okay, alright.

Mr Martin:   Can you, can you get, like go into my third drawer.

Candace:    Yep.

Mr Martin:    Where are you now?

Candace:    At home. I will get it just before I pick Olly, if that’s okay.

Mr Martin:   Yeah, yeah just, just ask the girls, if you can just duck into my office and its…

Candace:   Yeah.

Mr Martin:   … in the third drawer. Yeah if you could do that, like immediately, but yeah.

Candace:    Yeah okay (unintelligible)

Mr Martin:   Yeah I need to, yeah, yeah.

Candace:   You need to cancel it?

Mr Martin:   Yeah, yeah just, a psychiatric referral that should be, yes so.

Candace:    Ah huh, right.

Mr Martin:    It’s about six, it’s about six pages long. You will know it when you see it.

Candace:   Right. Um, just yeah I …

Mr Martin:    You’ve seen it once before, so.

Candace:    I have? Just the police might have it that’s all.

Mr Martin:   Did they go to work?

Candace:    Cause they, they did.

Mr Martin:   Can you go and have a look?

Candace:    Yeah I will. I promise I will. Yeah.

Mr Martin:   And I’ll call you tomorrow.”


	
	Later that day there was a further telephone conversation in which Mr Martin asked Candace Martin “So you haven’t been to work yet?” to which she replied “no not yet.”
	
	
	On 3 April 2015 there was a further call in which Mr Martin asked Candace whether she had been to work for him and she replied “I did. Um, it’s not there.”
	
	
	The Crown then points to the lengthy recorded interview between police and Candace Martin that took place on 9 April 2015 commencing at about 9:30am and concluding at 1:30pm. Towards the end of that interview, the police (at Q 1430) told the accused that they had seized the letter while executing a search warrant on Mr Martin’s office. They read passages of the letter to the accused and asked her to explain them. They put to her that Mr Martin had asked her to retrieve the letter from the drawer in his office and that she had agreed to do so. She denied any knowledge of the letter and denied agreeing to take steps to remove it from Mr Martin’s office.
	
	
	The Crown will rely on those responses as lies demonstrating a consciousness of guilt.
	
	
	After the interview, the accused spoke with an undercover police officer and the conversation was recorded by listening device. This occurred at around 6:30pm on 9 April 2015. She told the undercover officer police “He wrote me a letter and ... the police found it.” She said “it was pretty much a written confession.” Later the undercover officer asked her “Do they [investigating police] have much on him?” and Candace Martin replied, “that letter. And now me.” [4] 
	
	
	This body of evidence is capable of establishing that Candace Martin took steps to retrieve the letter (or at least agreed to do so) and that she told lies to the police on this subject. Accordingly, the evidence is relevant and admissible. It is capable of being used by a jury to establish a consciousness of guilt in Candace Martin. However, contrary to what I understood the Crown Prosecutor to submit, that decision does not mean the evidence become admissible as a tacit admission because of her failure to refute part of its contents in the text message of 3 March 2015. Nor does it mean that the letter itself, or its precise contents, should be or need to be elicited before the jury.
	


SEPARATE TRIAL APPLICATION

Principles


	
	Section 21(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act is as follows:
	


“If of the opinion:

(a) that an accused person may be prejudiced or embarrassed in his or her defence by reason of being charged with more than one offence in the same indictment, or

(b) that for any other reason it is desirable to direct that an accused person be tried separately for any one or more offences charged in an indictment,

the court may order a separate trial of any count or counts of the indictment.”


	
	Section 21(6) says “any power of the court under this section is in addition to and not in derogation of any other power of the court for the same or similar purposes.”
	
	
	Section 29(3) provides “proceedings related to 2 or more offences or 2 or more accused persons may not be heard together if the court is of the opinion that the matters ought to be heard and determined separately in the interests of justice.”
	
	
	I summarised the relevant principles in R v Roff [2015] NSWSC 1853 at [34]-[57]. The learned Crown Prosecutor referred to a similar, more authoritative but less current, summary undertaken by Sheller JA in Symss v R [2003] NSWCCA 77 at [68]-[73]:
	


“68 The decision whether or not to grant separate trials involves a consideration of the interests of justice, including conserving costs, the avoidance of inconvenience to witnesses and the desirability of common enterprises being jointly tried so as to avoid inconsistent verdicts.

69 In an unreported decision of 27 March 1991, in R v Middis 70412 of 1990 [5] , Hunt J said on the question of whether there should be separate trials:

‘Briefly, the relevant principles are that:

1. where the evidence against an applicant for a separate trial is significantly weaker than and different to that admissible against another or the other accused to be jointly tried with him, and

2. where the evidence against those other accused contains material highly prejudicial to the applicant although not admissible against him, and

3. where there is a real risk that the weaker Crown case against the applicant will be made immeasurably stronger by reason of the prejudicial material,

a separate trial will usually be ordered in relation to the charges against the applicant. The applicant must show that positive injustice would be caused to him in a joint trial.’

70 A little later in his judgment at p 5 Hunt J said:

‘I do not believe that the Court of Criminal Appeal in Oliver [(1984) 57 ALR 543] intended an applicant for a separate trial to demonstrate that positive injustice would more likely than not be caused by a joint trial (as it was suggested in argument); nor do I accept that a mere possibility of prejudice is sufficient (as it was also suggested in argument). In my view, what the Court of Criminal Appeal was saying was that, as some prejudice to one or other accused is inevitable in any joint trial, it must be shown by an applicant for a separate trial that the particular prejudice upon which reliance is placed by him would – if it arises – result in positive injustice to him in a joint trial.’

71 In Webb and Hay v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 41 at 88-89 Toohey J, with whom Mason CJ and McHugh J agreed, said on the question of whether there should have been separate trials:

‘King CJ dealt with this ground by pointing out that there are ‘strong reasons of principle and policy why persons charged with committing an offence jointly ought to be tried together. That is particularly so where each seeks to cast the blame on the other.’ R v Webb and Hay (1992) 59 SASR 563 at 585. What King CJ referred to as ‘strong reasons of principle and policy’ were discussed by his Honour in Reg v Collie (1991) 56 SASR 302 at 307-311. I respectfully agree with that discussion which emphasises that when accused are charged with committing a crime jointly, prima facie there should be a joint trial. There are administrative factors pointing in that direction but, more importantly, consideration by the same jury at the same trial is likely to avoid inconsistent verdicts, particularly when each accused tries to cast the blame on the other or others Reg v Demirok (1976) VR 244 at 254. There are of course dangers for an accused in a joint trial by reason of the admission of evidence which would not be admitted at the trial of one accused. That risk must be obviated by express and careful directions to the jury as to the use they may make of the evidence so far as it concerns each accused Reg v Harbach (1973) 6 SASR 427 at 433.

In the end the critical question before an appellate court in these circumstances is whether, by reason of the joint trial, there has been a substantial miscarriage of justice, or put another way, whether improper prejudice has been created against an accused.

In the present case adequate directions were given by the trial judge. It is true that Webb did not give evidence and was therefore not subject to cross-examination, though the jury heard his statements to the police implicating Hay. But, as King CJ observed (1992) 59 SASR at 585: ‘That is a commonplace feature of a joint trial and does not of itself render separate trials necessary.’ Properly instructed by the trial judge, as they were, the jury were capable of appreciating the use they could make of evidence as against each of the appellants. It has not been shown that a substantial miscarriage of justice is likely to have occurred.’

72 In R v Patsalis and Spathis (1999) 107 A Crim R 432 Kirby J refused an application for separate trials which was opposed not only by the Crown but also by the co-accused. In his reasons for judgment, which on appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal (2001) NSWCCA 476 at 148, Heydon JA, as his Honour then was, described at 148 as a model of their kind, Kirby J said at 434:

‘There is a rule, and a proviso to that rule. It is desirable, in the ordinary course, that all persons said to have been concerned with the one crime should be dealt with in the one trial. That rule is subject to the proviso that, if a joint trial would cause positive injustice to an accused, then a separate trial should be ordered; R v Oliver (1984) 57 ALR 543.’

73 Dealing with cut-throat defences Kirby J referred to the decision of Hunt CJ at CL in Ignjatic (1993) 68 A Crim R 333 and to Webb and Hay. In Ignjatic Hunt CJ at CL, after referring to earlier decisions, said at 339,:

‘Obviously, there will be cases in which cut-throat defences are raised where it may be appropriate to order separate trials, but they would not in my view arise frequently. In a proper summing up, the jury will be directed separately in relation to the evidence admissible against each accused; Masters (1992) 26 NSWLR 450 at 455. The undoubted prejudice created by such an unsworn statement by a co-accused in a joint trial is usually considerably lessened in such circumstance, and thus it would not amount to the positive injustice required to warrant separate trials.’ (emphasis added)

74 In this Court in Fernando (1999) NSWCCA 66 the trial judge had refused to order separate trials. The Court identified the issue which gave rise to the application for separate trials in these words at para 220:

‘The tenor of Brendon Fernando’s statements to the police was that while he was present during most of the events which occurred he was subject to the control of Vester Fernando, who was armed with a machete. Indeed, he stated to the police at the time when the victim was killed he was not present, having left the company of Vester Fernando and the victim shortly before the lethal event must have occurred. Thus, while his statements may not be considered as being a complete ‘cut-throat’ defence they are certainly exculpatory to a degree of his own participation and thoroughly implicate Vester Fernando.’

75 Brendon Fernando did not give evidence so that his statements were not capable of being tested by either the Crown Prosecutor or Vester Fernando’s counsel. Even so, the Court said at para 222:

‘However, his recorded admissions do, in the Court’s view, fall within the type of evidence adverted to in the authorities and particularly by Toohey J in Webb and Hay which support the contention that there ought to have been a joint trial.’

76 For present purposes I regard it as sufficient to emphasise the factors identified by King CJ in Collie and Webb and Hay and adopted by Toohey J in Webb and Hay in the High Court. There are important reasons of principle and policy why persons charged with committing an offence jointly ought to be tried together, particularly where each seeks to cast the blame on the other. The dangers from the admission of evidence which would not have been admitted if the appellant had stood trial alone can be obviated by express and careful directions as were given in this trial”.


	
	In the context of co-conspirators, the High Court considered when trials should be conducted jointly in the case of The Queen v Darby (1982) 148 CLR 668; [1982] HCA 32. Gibbs CJ, Aickin, Wilson and Brennan JJ concluded at 678:
	


“in our opinion there is much to be said for the recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Guimond v. The Queen (1979) 44 CCC (2d) 481 requiring separate trials in cases where the evidence admissible against one accused is significantly different from the evidence admissible against the other. We would encourage the adoption of such a practice. 


	
	This passage underpinned the oft-cited decision of Hunt J in Middis to which Sheller JA referred in Symss.
	
	
	Counsel for Candace Martin, in written and oral submissions, acknowledged that the starting point was that the trials should be heard together. However, it was submitted that the case falls within the kind of case contemplated in Middis. Reliance was placed on the decision in R v Pham [2004] NSWCCA 190. In that case, Adams J explained that the expression “immeasurably stronger” used by Hunt J in Middis should be understood to mean “significant, though not incommensurable"". Spigelman CJ and RS Hulme J agreed with Adams J subject to some additional observations in the judgment of RS Hulme J. RS Hulme J emphasised that:
	


“there was no practical way [the jury] could have assessed the credibility or reliability of the evidence of the two witnesses differently in the case against the Appellant than they had or would have done in the case against his brother.”


	
	That conclusion arose because of admissions made by the brother that tended to corroborate the evidence of the witnesses in question but which was not admissible against the appellant. All three judges were of the opinion that Pham’s trial miscarried. The factual circumstances in R v Pham were quite different to those of the present case although there are some common features. The most significant of those features is that the jury would be called upon to assess the same evidence on different bases and the accused would be required to face a trial where an admission made by her co-accused, which is not admissible against her as an admission, may be capable of suggesting that she was involved in the crime.
	


Application of these principles to the present case


	
	I have concluded the correct application of those principles, and the proper exercise of the discretion provided by ss 21, 29 and the common law, is to order separate trials.
	
	
	The material tendered on the separate trial application included two versions of the Crown Case Statement and the documents annexed to the affidavit of Candace Martin’s solicitor. The decision must be made in the light of that material and without knowing all of the detail in the Crown’s brief.
	
	
	As I have said, there appears to be a considerable body of evidence that is common to both accused. It seems this will include evidence proving the incidents giving rise to the charges, evidence going to the injuries and cause of death, witnesses who will testify about the movements of the two accused prior to and around the time of the offences, evidence concerning the insurance policies and Mr Martin’s interaction with the insurers, and communications between the two accused before and after the offences were committed.
	
	
	There are also separate bodies of evidence admissible against each accused that is not admissible against the other. This includes their interviews with police and evidence of post offence conduct, including lies, relied on by the Crown to demonstrate a consciousness of guilt.
	
	
	The issue for the jury will be different in each case as a result of the pleas of guilty entered by Candace Martin. In her case, Mr Martin’s involvement in the serious assaults of 7 April 2014 and the killing on 7 June 2014 will be admitted. That admission is inherent in her pleas of guilty. Mr Martin’s case appears to be that he was not involved in the first incident and was a victim in the second. This is not strictly a “cut throat defence”. Rather, like the case of R v Roff, it involves one accused implicating the co-accused while the other accused denies involvement. In Roff, the co-accused (Tarrant) implicated Mr Roff by her admissions to police. In the present case, Candace Martin will implicate Mr Martin by the solemn admissions inherent in her pleas of guilty to the accessory after counts.
	
	
	The Crown case is that there was longstanding animosity between Mr Martin and the deceased, and that the reconciliation that occurred in the early part of 2014 was a “ruse” to justify the taking out of the insurance policies that provided the financial motive for the killing. The Crown will seek to establish that Candace Martin “encouraged and emboldened” her husband by taking part in the “ruse” and agreeing to cover for him. [6]  In light of her pleas of guilty, the issue appears to be when she became aware of her husband’s plans and whether she was an accessory before (as opposed to after) the offence or (put another way) whether she was party to a joint criminal enterprise to kill the deceased. Her liability for the grievous bodily harm of Mr Manning involves the application of the principle of extended joint criminal enterprise.
	
	
	Insofar as it is possible to make an assessment on the material tendered on the application, it appears that the case against Mr Martin is stronger than the case against Candace Martin. That assessment is based on Mr Martin’s direct involvement in the two incidents, his presence at the scene of the murder, the evidence connecting him to the taking out of the insurance policies, his status as a beneficiary of those policies, the animosity between him and the deceased and the admissions made in the letter to Candace Martin.
	
	
	The prosecution will rely on the letter from Mr Martin to prove an admission. The jury will be required to consider the contents of the letter and decide whether it constitutes an admission (and, if so, to what) or whether it is capable of some other explanation. Having undertaken that task, and used the letter in that way in the case against Mr Martin, it would undoubtedly be difficult for the jury to follow and to obey directions that it should disregard the letter in the case against Candace Martin except for the purpose of determining whether her attempt to retrieve it for her husband, and her subsequent lies about it, demonstrated a consciousness of guilt (and, if so, in respect of which offence). I accept Mr Healy’s submission that the adducing of the letter in her trial will make the case against her significantly stronger, albeit that it is not admissible against her and that the jury would be directed accordingly. That conclusion is not determinative of the application for a separate trial but it is very important in determining whether Candace Martin would be “prejudiced or embarrassed in her defence” and whether it is in the interests of justice to separate the trials.
	
	
	I accept that the starting point is that the trials should be conducted jointly. I have taken into account the potential or risk of inconsistent verdicts if the trials are separated. I also accept that there will be a degree of duplication in the tendering of common evidence in separate trials and that this will involve some inconvenience to the witnesses and will, almost certainly, lengthen the proceedings. However, the eliciting of the evidence proving the attempted murder and murder, and Mr Martin’s involvement in those events, is likely to be much simpler in Candace Martin’s trial as a result of her admission (inherent in her plea) that Mr Martin is guilty of both offences in which she is alleged to be an accessory. Further, if the trials are separated the jury will not be required to approach that body of evidence on two different bases. That is, the jury will not be required to approach Candace Martin’s case on the basis that the inferences the Crown asks it to draw against Mr Martin should be accepted while, in Mr Martin’s case, deciding whether there is any other explanation available.
	
	
	I accept that, generally, juries are able to discern between the cases for co-accused and are fastidious in obeying the directions of trial judges, including directions to disregard evidence tendered against one accused but not against the other. [7]  However, as I said in a different context, this principle can only be taken so far:
	


“The discretions residing in a trial judge to exclude prejudicial evidence, to suppress evidence during the currency of a trial, to discharge a jury without verdict if inadmissible evidence comes before it and to order separate trials of co-accused and severance of multiple counts are all examples of legal remedies which would not exist if it were universally the case that juries were capable of obeying directions and disregarding prejudicial material. It is a question of degree and turns on a thorough analysis of both the nature and extent of the prejudicial material and the method by which it will be introduced into the trial.” [8] 


	
	It is one thing for a jury to understand and obey a direction that it is to disregard altogether evidence tendered against one accused but not admissible against another. It is a more difficult thing for a jury to come to certain conclusions about whether a piece of evidence constitutes an admission in one case, and to put those conclusions out of its mind while considering the same evidence (in the other case) on the issue of whether the accused demonstrated a consciousness of guilt by taking steps to hide the evidence and by lying about it.
	
	
	Having considered all of the above matters, I am satisfied that it is in the interests of justice to make the order that Candace Martin be tried separately from Mr Martin. I am also satisfied that the accused will be embarrassed or prejudiced in her defence if the trials are conducted jointly. The factors militating in favour of making the order overcome the considerable hurdle, and prima facie position, that those alleged to have been jointly responsible for a crime or crimes should be tried together.
	
	
	I have taken into account the desirability that the accused be tried together in terms of the convenience of witnesses and likely savings in court time. I have considered the risk of inconsistent verdicts. Without attempting to be exhaustive, and in short summary form, the matters that persuade me that there should be an order for separate trials are:
	



	
	The case against the Mr Martin is considerably stronger than the case against Candace Martin.
	
	
	The case against Candace Martin will be made stronger by the admission in a joint trial of evidence that is not admissible against her (namely, the admission made by Mr Martin and the full text of the letter in which that admission is made).
	
	
	While there is a significant body of common evidence, there are also substantial bodies of evidence which are either admissible against one accused only or unlikely to be disputed (and able to be elicited briefly, or made subject to admissions) in Candace Martin’s case.
	
	
	The jury would be required to consider the evidence of the letter on the basis that it may constitute an admission against Mr Martin in deliberating on his case, while being required to ignore the text of the admission in Candace Martin’s case in considering whether her actions in attempting to retrieve the letter and telling lies about the letter in one case.
	
	
	In spite of firm and clear directions, even the most conscientious juror will struggle to obey such directions because of the sub-conscious impact of the assessment of the admissions in Mr Martin’s case when the jury considers the consciousness of guilt evidence in Candace Martin’s case.
	



	
	The impact of Candace Martin’s pleas of guilty to the accessory after charge also militates in favour of separating the trials of the two accused. I accept the submission of the Crown Prosecutor and counsel for Candace Martin that severance of those counts may operate unfairly to Candace Martin. However, there is some force in the submission that Mr Martin may be embarrassed or prejudiced if he were tried by the same jury that heard Candace Martin enter pleas of guilty which have, as their foundation, the guilt of Mr Martin. It is not necessary to consider this matter further as I have not heard full submissions on the issue and no application for separate trials was made by Mr Martin. However, it is a further matter that fortifies the conclusion that I should exercise the discretion to separate the trials of the two accused.
	
	
	Accordingly, I will make an order that Candace Martin be tried separately to Phillip Martin.
	


ORDERS


	
	For the foregoing reasons, I make the following orders and evidentiary rulings:
	



	
	The evidence of the letter and the text message in response is not admissible as an admission by Candace Martin.
	
	
	The evidence of Candace Martin’s attempt to retrieve the letter and her lies in relation to the letter are admissible to prove a consciousness of guilt.
	
	
	Order that Candace Martin be tried separately to Michael Phillip Martin

Letter from Michael Phillip Martin to Candace Martin

[Page numbers of originals indicated in square brackets]

[P 1] Dear Candace,

I am writing to you in this letter because as you are well aware of by now, I am not the best at revealing my emotions. No matter what you think, I sincerely do care for you and hope that you are coping as well as what you seem to be. Reading this letter is entirely up to you and should you prefer to tear this letter up or disregard it as rubbish, then I completely understand. However, should you read it, then all I ask is that you think on what I say over a period of time.

I wish to go back to the very start, back in 2005 when we were both very young...

Teenage sweet hearts I must first say. Unfortunately you were not my first and I will drum it into all our kids to wait for that first love because not losing my virginity to you is one of my biggest regrets in life. However, you were definitely my first love and in my mind there had never been any other girls.

It stills sits in my mind the amount of times we used to fondle each other, everywhere and anytime. But sexual feelings aside, the flutter in my chest each time I saw you took my breath away, whether looking amazing in a dress and makeup or sweating and vomiting at zenny. That was true love. Not the kind that comes and goes, or even the kind in the movies (after all the movies are fake), but certainly for me, it was true love.

I imagined my life with you, some kids, and beautiful possessions that you so certainly deserve. I look back at how young I was and think maybe I was just a foolish teenager with my head in the clouds (or some people would even say thinking with the wrong head J) But I know for certain now, years later that I wasn't just dreaming. You were and are my soul mate.

When we broke up as teenagers, we were so determined to be strong and not show how much we were hurting. So much so that we thought the other didn't even have feelings for each other, ""ever”. But we both know now that we longed for the hugs and kisses from each other, even years later, and even when we had partners (well, maybe you had a partner, mine... words can't explain...) But we had our best go at trying to move one with our lives.

When I found out you were pregnant and then going to be married, a little piece inside me shattered, because I honestly thought I’d lost any chance I ever had with you forever. And why… just because I was such a hard headed fool.

The years ticked by. Yeah, I had Jack (as weird as that sounds). But Jack and I were as close as two males should ever be. We would finish each other's sentences, cry when the other was down and out, drink and party when the other felt happy. The times, good and bad, that Jack and I had was a stage in my life that I never want to take back.

I remember my first rodeo with Jack. Toogoolawah Rodeo 2008. Jack said “Mick mate, Toogoolawah Rodeo is on Saturday 3 weeks. What do ya reckon, should we ride bareback”. We'd watched video after video, and Jack had an old bareback rigging from the 70's, so actually jumping on sounded like the best idea anyone had ever come up with. Jack was underage to legally sign up so I signed him up as my ""step brother"" as was his ""legal guardian"". What a load of crap. So without telling the Old Fella where we were going, Jack and I packed our swags and gear, cranked up old Slim Dusty and headed to our first rodeo.

[P 2] The rain had made the usual arena too wet so they set up a small roughstock yard on the oval, run a couple of tines through which didn't soften the yard, just made it look a little rougher. The only gear we had was an old bareback rigging from the 70's (similar to that old leather one I have), a gardening glove, no spurs, no vest, and Jack had an ice hockey helmet. Biggest redneck hicks this side of Bourke.

Anyway, Jack was first. He came out of the chutes on this pieball horse which started roaring. Let me say this, Jack ""shit"" himself. About three bucks out and he grabbed on with two hands and when the pick-up men come to get him, he thought ""fuck this"" and just jumped off. Funniest thing you've ever seen.

Then it was my turn. Well big tough Mick, ""na Woodrow (I called him that from Lonesome Dove), I don't need a helmet, I won't fall off”. Haha. This horse came out of the chutes, bucked a couple of times and took off. Well I slid off half sideways but I was still hanging on. Everyone thought I was hung up and couldn't get off, but I just wanted to ride so bad I didn't want to let go. Well upside down, my head hit the ground, I got thrown a couple of metres into the dirt and got up with the biggest smile on my face. I had never (even with the ring fight) had that much adrenaline.

Back then Jack and I only drunk by ourselves. So back to camp we go, had a few beers and a sleep. When we got back to the Old Fella's, we were so excited we jumped out and said ""Hey Old Fella, guess what we done last night."" He replies ""I hope you two didn't get into bloody trouble again"" ""na, we rode bareback last night at the Toogoolawah Rodeo"". Well you could of heard a pin drop. We thought he was going to explode. Then he just said ""you silly buggers. You should of told me and I would have given you a hand."" Well that was it, Jack and I were hooked on rodeo.

But I thought I'd tell you that even though you've heard it a million times, but that was a time with the first person since you that I had been truly happy. Unfortunately, rodeo was the same thing that tore Jack and I apart. And funny enough; predominantly because of drug users. I still maintain that he doesn't tough drugs them but then again, I have been proven wrong many times before. But that did harden me. It took me a lot to lower my guard even for you.

Anyway, even though Jack and I were best mates, there was still something missing. Something I needed and I remember how you still played on my mind. I had company, but I didn't have love. I didn't have somebody to hold me or for me to hold them. I think sex is over exaggerated because while the feeling is great, it's the close bond of love that gives the best feeling. Old Country Music is one of my passions but also one of my weaknesses. As much as it makes me happy, the lyrics also made me very lonely.

I guess that's why I tried to find the ""love"" feeling that you and I had with others but I never could. Sex never gave me that flutter in my chest and I guess that's why I tried a ""relationship"" (if that's what we'll call it). But she had the mind of a two year old (still does; nothing's changed). I needed more than just touch. Something I could interact with. When we spoke again after so long without communication, it was like a spark was instantly lit.

You could give me more than just intimacy. You were (still are), apart from extremely beautiful; bright, passionate, loving, mothering, nurturing. The list could go on. But it was you [P 3] that was the part missing in my life and I guess in part that made me more lonely because I certainly thought I didn't have a chance.

Then when we really opened up, you revealed your feelings about your own relationship. How, no matter what you did, it wasn't appreciated. How, he would just come home and do nothing. And no matter what you did, he was just like a version of Sam. Do nothing but expect everything. And when we both knew each other's feelings for one another, it was like a light bulb suddenly turned on inside my head. Maybe, just maybe, I had a chance and that night, sitting on the bank of Atkinsons Dam (of all places). You and I shared that special moment. Not the sexual moment that many would have but that intimate connection that souls make (how sappy is that).

I must admit, I had big reservations about starting a relationship with a married woman, regardless of whether you had broken up. I guess I still wasn't convinced it was real and wasn't sure if I was just that rebound guy. In some ways I look back and think, is that why I didn't just tell McKay to fuck off from the very start? I guess there was that fear that you were only ""window shopping"" and that maybe after that I would be alone again.

That day that you refer to ""me cheating on you"" was a black day in my mind. I will maintain to my dying day that I did not do anything sexual however, I did cross a line that shouldn't be crossed, regardless of what stage of the relationship anyone is at. Nesi had recently broken it off with Jack, and so her and McKay came over for sympathy I guess. Maybe they had other things on their mind, who knows, who cares. But the alcoholic that I was, thought that the answer would be alcohol, so I brought out my home brew. We were all shotting my spirits however the two girls were certainly downing my one to their two / three.

A couple of bottles were empty and a swim decided like a good idea. The girls already had bikinis on and I stripped to my jocks. Nothing out of the ordinary happened until Nesi planted a kiss on me. I stepped back and said ""whoa Nesi. That's not going to make it better"". So Nesi planted a kiss on Jess whom returned the favour. After the swim we went back for more drinks. We had a couple more and Jess started rubbing Nesi and things progressed from there. Jess knew you and I were together because she kept saying ""she won't do this and she won't do that. I'll do whatever you want, come over here, etc..."" I was watching ""the show"", which to this day I regret. After probably half an hour, Angus came home and they ran out naked and tried with Angus. It was the same time Angus has the clap otherwise he would have gone for it for sure. He always used to talk about banging Nesi and how lucky Jack was.

Anyway, regardless of what Rob or Angus say, none of them can actually say they saw me having sex with those girls. Angus and I drove them back to Nesi's place but we had to drop them up the road as they said they were too drunk and needed to sober up. I spoke to Nesi and Jess the following day and the only recollection they had was drinking, some watermelon, and then going for a swim. I told them what they had done, they thought I was involved and couldn't believe I wasn't.

I know you're hearing other stories but that is the honest truth. Those people who are saying they definitely saw it have shit dribbling out of their mouth. And you also have had memory loss from a hard session on my homebrew, so know that I'm not making shit up when I say that couldn't recall. As for McKay, the lies that she tells not just about this but everything in

[P 4] life are phenomenal. I remember when we were ""somewhat together"", she had created a fake ""Lisa Simpson"" facebook account and was causing shit between another married couple down the road from her (that Brad Priggins). Anyway, they knew it was her, however she swore black and blue it wasn't. I even screamed at her to make sure she was telling the truth to me. Again ""it wasn't me, i wouldn't break up a marriage, ra ra ra"". So I backed her up, went down to their place, caused a massive ""verbal"" fight, said that she wouldn't lie to me, etc, etc. Truth came out after that she was in fact that person. ""Haha, big joke, they deserved it."" I could not understand how she could lie like that; to me, to her parents, to the police, to everyone.

Anyway, what I'm saying is that I can't control who you wish to be friends with but just have a hard think about the people you want your kids to associate ""being an adult"" with. From the very start, she has done her best against you and I. First the whole ""threesome"", then you were pregnant and didn't know who the father was, I would be an abusive parent (her telling that Priggins) and had a criminal history to get Ollie taken off you, and now this latest crap, just ongoing and ongoing. She has a very extensive history of lies throughout her entire life and has purposely taken joy out of interfering with other marriages before. In my mind, she is not someone to be trusted, has nothing to offer you (support / guidance), really shouldn't be a role model for our kids and really what type of friend is that. I guess I just wish you would have a look at the bigger picture and longer term friendship of you and her because she will interfere with any relationship (friendship or other) that you may have in the future (she even got the shits about you and Steph). I just wish you'd realise that you have far better friends than her. I would have paid for you to take weekly trips to Kingaroy to see Katelyn because I could see that she was someone who cared for you and would offer both support and guidance throughout your whole life not just while it suited her.

But moving on. The start was rough for us. First trying to get rich quick. Counterfeit is something I will definitely be advising our kids to stay very clear from. But we learn from our mistakes and moved to Windsor Park. That was a good time in our lives because we only had Ollie, Angus was working nights, the house was ""our"" first house, we decided on trying for a baby, we got engaged and other miscellaneous times. But when the pregnancy started turning for the worst, it did cut our ""honeymoon"" period short and times became very difficult both health wise for you but also arguments between us. I think that was the start of all this name calling and hurtful words that have tried both of us so much.

When me first bought our house, I thought, finally, I have made it in life. This is the place I want to be. I have a house (yes, that needed work, but a house), a beautiful fiancée, a step son who couldn't be anything less but my own, and my own baby on its way. Wow, what a year could make. But then, the pregnancy went sour. You were back and forth from hospital, we didn't know whether Mikey would make it, your dad and I were having issues because he wanted to be as included as he was with Ollie (and I'm sorry, but I'm not the sort that would allow another man to play my part if I could help it, no matter who he was) and then that day. When you called to say your waters had broken, my heart sank. I dropped everything I was doing and ran out the door (I actually think 1 left all my computer, etc on without saving) All I could think about was you and our son.

Those hours you spent with the Magnesium Sulphate broke my heart. I wished there was something more I could do but I couldn't and I knew how much pain you were in. Then that moment when the doctor came in and said it's time. You and I were trembling walking into [P 5] that operating room. I was so nervous and scared. Nothing can describe my feelings, so I can't imagine what you felt. Well it wasn't very long and they waved Mikey over the curtain and I don't know what I was expecting but certainly not that. You instantly went into shock, my blood pressure went though the roof. Blood started pouring out of my nose and I was taken from the room. Wow, the scariest moment hands down of my life.

The next six months were so eventful. It felt like six years with Mikey in hospital. Not only was it so touch and go with Mikey, but you had major health issues, I had to return to work to keep money coming in, the house needed renovations before Mikey came home and I just remember thinking to myself back then that I couldn't maintain this pace for much longer.

The day we brought Mikey home was, apart from becoming engaged, the only moment that I can say to that point I was happy beyond believe. Absolutely overwhelmed with joy. But because of Mikey's health, it was also a day of fear and anxiety with the home oxygen. I kept thinking to myself, can you and I really look after this child on oxygen. What happens if this, what happens if that... But you and I together made it through. Rather well I might say for having no medical training.

But over those two years, you and I had a lot of adjusting to do. We are both Aries and being pig-headed (or as we like to say ""strong willed""), we couldn't give in to each other. I had my issues with other women and whilst I didn't see it at the time, I do now. Ail my role models in life, including the Capewells, had pornography in their household similar to that of a Womens Day magazine I guess because of their relaxed nature or well I don't know, but pornography doesn't affect the way they feel. I have come to the view that to look at a good looking woman in the street is to simply respect the fact that they are more attractive than the average person but to perv on them or to look at nude women in magazines is disrespectful to your partner and whilst it may not be ""cheating"" it does break a boundary in a loving relationship. I guess this has been a big factor in our problems over the years but I just want you to know that the last time I looked at porn was after that fight we had in June last year. Since then, and even now after our split, I have not looked at porn, as tempting as it has been recently.

Anyway getting back to children. A girl was always a dream I had. I don't know why but the name Rose always stuck in my mind and when you said you wanted to try for a girl, I was pleased but extremely fearful. I knew that Ollie had come early, Mikey had come early and we knew regardless that Rose was going to come early, just hopefully later than 30 weeks. I felt you were very forceful in your decision to try and that it was a case of an egg timer decision that had to be made asap or else we couldn't try again. We certainly were hasty but looking back, I don't think waiting any time would have made a difference.

Hormones (especially the first trimester) did and still make you very moody and I know that our arguments kept turning for the worse and with each fight came more hurtful insults from both sides. In hindsight, we should have gone to relationship counselling then but hindsight is a lovely thing.

Our wedding was the most beautiful moment of my life. We had planned everything together. Even your wedding dress (who does that). Simple yet elegant. And I think that explains how personalities to the core. I couldn't have asked for a more beautiful, elegant bride full of such charisma and passion. Words can't describe how I felt watching you walk up that aisle. My [P 6] speech, which I rehearsed and knew word for word, blurted out as if giving my first English oral. Our honeymoon, whilst had its moments was relaxing Just you, I and the world. We could have gone to the Maldives and done the Hollywood experience but I think you and I sitting back together, peacefully watching a bloody action movie, batman of all things, was a nice way to celebrate our marriage together. Just a couple of days and we missed our lovely two boys too much and had to return (as well as for my fucking job).

But when things turned for the worse with the pregnancy, and you were back getting the Magnesium Sulphate, it was like reliving a nightmare. Back into that operating room. When they got me to walk around and see Rose under the plastic, I think a part of me stayed there. Seeing my little angel wrapped in cling wrap, doctors resuscitating her and nothing I could do to help. When I got the waiting room, I just broke, I was crying like I had never cried before (even with Mikey). Then you came out and even as worn out as you were, you still looked amazing.

Just like Mikey, both of us entered the NICU together, as a team, to meet our newborn child. And just like Mikey, both of us made it through hospital with little Rose coming home. I know I made it an urgency about getting the snip, and I do hope you know it has nothing to do with you. I would have certainly had 10 more babies with you, but I couldn't do another micro-prem.

After settling into our lives back home in Esk, I thought you and I would also settle back in to routine and our arguments would progressively get less. I guess with the continued stresses of work, money, family, and life in general, our coping mechanism that had kept us together through the premies was to take it out on each other, which seems absolutely crazy but we got through such extremely difficult times together. I guess in hindsight, this was another moment we should have called for help.

That Christmas Party of 2013 was quite a happy one for me. I finally had my family, work was going ""ok"", and I was quite friendly with my work colleagues. I admit, I had too many drinks especially being on strong anti-depressants. The party was all but ended when you showed up, drinks had stopped and everybody was heading home but us stragglers. After a bit more of a yarn, I had full intentions on walking home but I can fully understand where you were coming from. You didn't want me being drunk around the children, plus you were ready to put them to bed, etc. I felt very disrespected when you stormed up to pick me up, gave me an earful as soon as I got in the car, and then continued when we got home. I know you thought I was going to drink the homebrew, but I certainly had no intentions of that but then you tipped it everywhere and again I felt very disrespected because not only had you hurt my feelings but you had spilt all my ""hobby"" everywhere which dripped down through the floorboards and just seemed like you didn't care about the house either.

I know you said you always wanted me to lean on you for support and I guess I didn't show it as much as you'd have liked but you were my anchor in life. Without you and the kids, I felt like I'd have gone back even worse than that lonely person at Churchable. Suicide has always been a major weakness of mine and I know that you think it's when I don't get my way, but that's not the case. When I feel like I've lost control of my life and going backwards I have this major fear of turning out like my father. When I get into that mind frame, it's very dangerous for me. When you put the kids in the car and left, I should have known it was just a bad arguments but I panicked. I instantly went into that dark place where everything went

[7] from bad to worse and felt like my only way to free myself and free the people I loved was to pass on from this life (a challenge I'm still facing because I still do feel that way but I’m working on it). If I had access to a gun that day, I would have used it, but a rope was available and so I contemplated it. There was a big part of me that wanted to live, and I guess that's why I never wrote a note but the overwhelming side of me spoke more sense at that time. I sat on that stool, leaned forward until my airways were restricted, still contemplating whether I should or not, until I finally went to sleep. After that I had no control and I didn't wake until the ambulance so I can't imagine the scene that I objected you and Oliver to and that is the biggest regret of my life. If I could turn back time, I would have gone for a walk up Highland Street, or called dad. Anything, but reality is that I didn't and I now have to live with my poor choices.

I guess we never really got better after that. Money got tighter and we had another bright idea to free our lives up more. I wouldn't have to work so hard and therefore worry less. You and I would finally be able to have the things in life we ever wanted. Plans were set and everything seemed perfect. Our biggest problem is that we are too good at heart. Our guilt has stuck since the moment we concocted our bright idea. Looking back, if I could have seen the ramifications on our marriage, there is no way I would have considered it but again, I have to live with my choices.

After that trip to Nanna & Pa's and that night thereafter, I feel so guilty, but not for what happened but for the way I let myself lose control. 25 years of torture from these people led me to do the unthinkable. I let myself lose control and it scared me. Not at what I did but the mere fact that the animal side got the better of me. I know for a fact that I can control myself every other time. But for those few minutes, I let my emotions control everything I did and the result could be seen. I was a very hurt man who had been hurt by the very person who should have loved me the most but caused me so much pain.

I guess it was my guilt that caused me to be at the hospital so much. I was guilty because every time I entered that room, I saw what I had done. What my raw emotion had done and it hurt me so much. I guess it was the main reason I tried so hard to finish it then. To put the man that had taken the full brunt of my animal side out of pain. But he was too strong. A pig-headed bastard like me. But after he came out of that coma, I thought to myself that I would let him go on and lead a somewhat normal existence. I would even help him make a new start. Maybe I could even make him impress his mother. Wow, imagine if I could do that.

But then the bitch got involved and got him out of hospital too early. I knew it wouldn't last. Once she found out she couldn't get money out of him then she was through with him. And the only person who was left to pick up the pieces was me. And how cruel of me to get you and the kids to have to deal with such a big burden because of me. The trip home from Beerwah made me realise one thing. Nothing I or anyone else in this world could ever make this man change. He spoke with such bitterness and anger about everything including his own mother. I thought maybe I could get him back to hospital, maybe get him to rent an apartment somewhere near the coast and leave him be. I could see him occasionally but wouldn't have to have too much to do with him. And then I realised how scared he made you.

How could I ask this of my wife; the one person who gave me life and was the reason I wanted to live and succeed. And at that time, all I could give her was fear because of what I [P 8] had done. It wasn't your fear but mine that caused me to come up with the solution I did. In that trip down to NSW, I knew what was coming but spoke to dad as if everything were fine. That one trip revealed a lot to me about my father. But through everything, the most evident was that this shell was a good man gone too far bad. He hated everything about himself, everyone else and just the world. He told me that he just wished he died in hospital so he didn't have to be in pain (not physical) anymore.

I had a choice that night. I could have quite easily packed up and brought him home but I wanted to ease his pain. But was that my place. I now know it wasn't but I felt at the time that I had caused every bit of his pain for the last 25 years so I carried through with my plan. As I said, I'm too good a person to be professional and let that demon be released again. I can't explain how scared that makes me and from that morning on, I vowed to never let myself lose control ever again. And to my dying day, no one will ever see that again.

I certainly haven't handled things well thereon. I didn't want to traumatise you with my own issues about that night so thought that working and putting it at the back of my mind was better. Unfortunately I now see that you and the children have been hurt in that process and how selfish of me to do that to you guys. I wish I had better strategies to cope with things and I think with help from Rhonda, my new Psychiatrist and regardless of us, a relationship specialist, I think I will be able to improve myself dramatically. I am truly sorry I have hurt you through this whole disaster but I don't regret you and I. The only part I regret is the poor choices I have made.

I know you don't understand why I work so hard, and through some recent reflections I believe it has to do with my fear of failure. And through my fear of failure, I guess I have tried to push you too hard, as well as the kids and this will be something I am going to focus on fixing because if not I know it will destroy my relationship with the kids. However, I will be staying with Somerset for a while because I am enjoying my new role at work and certainly see room for progression. Andrew is the best boss I've ever had and even with the last fortnight's events, has been of great support to me. On the weekend just went, he sent me a message saying that he was looking forward to seeing me (and also helping him with work) but aside from that he seems very genuine and I think a good friendship will come of this.

The only other thing I want to touch on is my last attempt. I truly am sorry for putting you and the kids through it again. I wish I had waited until you had left so you didn't have to witness it. I am also sorry because this was the most serious I have ever been about wishing to pass on. The regret I have from hurting you over the last few years, the regret I have about losing control last year with those two events. I went into a major downhill spiral when you said you were leaving and all I could think was that I have driven away the only people who love me. I have caused pain to anyone who has ever come in contact with me and the only way I could release you and the kids was to release myself and pass on. I know you think it wasn't a serious attempt, but I spoke to the doctors and they have had people with a lot less die and that I obviously have a purpose here on Earth. After taking those pills, I slowly felt every sense float away. My vision and thoughts were last to go and I know those letters probably made no sense but the peace that I felt when I went to sleep was a feeling that I can't help but yearn for. I am seriously working on that and from this point on, I will make it known to anybody and everybody, that when I go, it will be from natural or other causes apart from my own.

[P 10] I am so, so sorry that I have hurt you and I can now understand why you left. I am hoping that you have had time to read this and not just thrown it out as rubbish from your ex. This is from my heart and every word I have wrote comes from a good place. I hope that one day you can forgive me and maybe even work with me in getting back that feeling that used to take our breath away. I know you still have love for me as I do for you. Nothing you can do or say will change that for me. There will never be another woman because every word in my vows was spoken true to heart and forever is life for me. I know only time can heal the wounds I have caused but if you have any inclination that a flame for me can once again burn strong, than please give me a chance to help with the healing. I know this isn't going to be a tomorrow thing but I think in time, if you and I can start to reignite that flame, work on ourselves, and fall madly in love again, I honestly think we will have an all time enduring love that nothing will tear apart. From the bottom of my heart I am sorry for everything and I love you with my entire heart Candace. You are not just my partner, or my wife but you are my soul partner and I truly believe we only have one in the world. If you can please just let your guard down a little and work with me on this, I will prove to you how much of a better man I can become. I don't expect an answer anytime soon and you don't have to tell me directly. But if the time comes, I would give the world for you.

With all my love,

Micheal

6320713,R v King [2017] NSWDC 297,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: An important part of deciding what sentence to impose upon an offender concerns the harm caused by the offender’s crime. Greater awareness by judges of the effects of sexual offending on the victims of such crimes has led to a significant increase in sentences for that type of offence over the past few years. Yet the law is that I must effectively ignore this increased awareness. I must sentence a sexual offender according to sentencing principles and ranges which we now know to be wrong. Indeed some of the statements made in cases, including cases in the Court of Criminal Appeal in the late 60s and early 70s, make for very uncomfortable reading.
	
	
	I am aware that it is possible that the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse is considering recommending a change in the law. Until such a recommendation is made and accepted, I will apply the law as it is, despite my obvious distaste for it.
	
	
	I should emphasise something quite fundamental; the sentence that I will impose upon the offender is much more lenient than I would impose upon him if I applied present day sentencing principles and a proper understanding of the harm that sexual offending causes.
	
	
	The offender now stands to be sentenced for offences involving two complainants. Without any disrespect to them at all, I will call them ‘A’ and ‘C’. My reasons for not using their proper names in this judgment, which may well come to be published on the internet and thus publically available, is obvious. I do not treat them as lesser human beings because I refer to them by initials.
	
	
	Although the offence involving C came last in time, I will describe it first because of the importance the evidence regarding this offence played in the trial.
	
	
	The offender was a Christian Brother. He still is. He taught maths and science at St Patrick’s College, Strathfield, a Catholic all‑boy’s school.
	
	
	One day in 1987 the offender approached C and told him that he wished to speak to him about the fact that C had been getting into trouble recently. An arrangement was made whereby the offender would drive C home so that they could discuss things on the way. However, on the way home the offender began to ask C highly inappropriate questions concerning whether C possessed pornographic magazines. The offender asked C to collect some pornographic magazines from his home and C did so, giving them to the offender.
	
	
	A little while after that the offender asked C whether he could drive him home again. C was suspicious as to what was going on. He made an excuse to delay this happening. He then equipped himself with his father’s dictaphone so that when the offender did drive C home for the second time, the conversation between them was recorded.
	
	
	As soon as C left the company of the offender he played that recording to his brother who transcribed what he heard. Copies of the recording and copies of the transcript were made. A number of people were given those copies, some of whom gave evidence at the trial. Unfortunately all copies of the recording have been lost in the intervening years but fortunately a copy of the transcript was found in the offender’s personnel file at the school.
	
	
	Despite the offender’s denials when giving evidence in the trial, I am satisfied that the transcript prepared by C’s brother is an accurate reflection of what the offender said to C. I make this finding for the following reasons:
	
	
	Firstly, and most obviously, it is consistent with the jury’s verdict.
	
	
	Secondly, the transcript is consistent with notes made by the then headmaster of the school who had heard the recording when he was interviewing the offender about the contents of the conversation with C.
	
	
	Thirdly, a number of other witnesses who have heard the recording gave evidence as to the accuracy of the transcript.
	
	
	And fourthly, if the transcript was inaccurate, especially if it is was deliberately so, then it is unlikely that the person who prepared the transcript would have handed both the recording and the transcript over at the same time.
	
	
	Thus, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, as were the jury, that at one stage in the conversation the offender showed C an advertisement in one of the pornographic magazines. That advertisement was for an anal vibrator, a “pulsator 240”. The offender asked C how that worked. That action by the offender forms the basis of count 8 on the indictment, an offence against s 61E(2A) of the Crimes Act for which the maximum penalty is four years imprisonment.
	
	
	I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was in effect sounding C out and grooming him in the hope that he would one day be able to indecently assault C. Fortunately C’s initiative in using his father’s dictaphone to record what the offender was doing thwarted the offender’s plans. That recording not only protected C but protected other boys at the school, because it was instrumental in the decision being made that the offender would never again teach at St Patrick’s College.
	
	
	In assessing the objective gravity of this offence Mr Walsh points out that there was no touching involved. Of course had there been touching this would have been a more serious offence exposing the offender to a higher penalty.
	
	
	There is no evidence of any great harm suffered by C. That is, perhaps, consistent with the recording giving him power over the offender rather than the offender having power over him. And as Mr Walsh points out, C appears to have been familiar with the content of the magazines and was thus not being exposed by the offender to any pornography with which he had not earlier come into contact.
	
	
	The offences involving A occurred many years before, in either 1975 or 1976. The offender was not a teacher of A’s, but despite that the offender began paying special attention to A in the playground. They would have conversations and A noticed that when the offender was passing, the offender would make extended eye contact with him. This was something which pleased A. He enjoyed the attention being given to him by a teacher.
	
	
	The offender was a keen camper and abseiler and he would arrange camps at which certain boys were invited to attend. At one such camp that A attended, circumstances came about that there was no room in any tent for A to sleep. The offender invited A to share his tent. Again, A was pleased by this development. Whilst in the tent the offender removed A’s belt and A went to sleep with the offender resting his hand on his, that is, A’s hip.
	
	
	The Crown told the jury that this was part of the process of testing the waters, exploring the likelihood of that A would say something about the offender’s activities to someone else. It is consistent with the offender’s approach to C which I have earlier described.
	
	
	Sometime after that camp, the offender invited A to join him in a preparation room attached to a science laboratory. This was after the offender had begun discussing sexual matters with A, and said to him at one stage “you’d make for an interesting experiment”. Once in the preparation room the offender said to A “Jesus wants us all to be happy”, unzipped A’s fly and began to fondle A’s penis. This represents count 1, an offence of indecent assault on a male for which the maximum penalty was five years imprisonment.
	
	
	The offender then took A’s hand and placed it on his, that is, the offender’s penis, he having unzipped his own fly and exposed his penis. That is the basis of count 2, another offence of indecent assault on a male.
	
	
	The offender then placed his hand on A’s head and moved A’s head down towards his penis until his penis actually touched A’s face. This is count 3, another offence of indecent assault on a male. It was this last action which caused A’s to begin to exhibit signs of considerable distress. He gave evidence that he was so upset by what was happening, and so unsure was he about what was going on, that he actually called out for his mother, despite the fact of course that she was nowhere nearby.
	
	
	At this turn of events, which must have come as something of a surprise to the offender, the offender stopped what he was doing and attempted to calm A down, telling him that no one needed to know what had just gone on. They left the laboratory.
	
	
	After that, A noticed that the offender did not pay him the special attention he had been paying him in the past. He blamed himself for that, thinking that he must have done something wrong.
	
	
	When A recounted the events in his evidence before the jury he appeared to be reliving what occurred and exhibited a level of distress rarely seen, even in this court where similar evidence is given on a daily basis.
	
	
	A was asked at trial why he had not told anyone about these events before he went to the Royal Commission and, in particular, why he had not told his parents. A’s evidence as to the reasons was delivered while he was again in a highly distressed state, sobbing as he told the jury why he had kept things a secret from his parents. He explained that his parents made many sacrifices so that they could afford the private school fees to send him and his brother to St Patrick’s College. His father was a taxi driver who worked seven days a week. His mother did various part-time jobs because they wanted to give their sons a good education. A explained that he could not bring himself to tell his parents that their sacrifices had in fact put him in harm’s way.
	
	
	A has prepared a victim impact statement. It was read to the Court on his behalf this morning. It is an eloquent demonstration of the harm that these sorts of offences cause: Lifelong harm; Significant harm; Harm which extends beyond difficulties with intimate relationships, and can, as it did in A’s case, affect his whole life; he even contemplated suicide on two occasions.
	
	
	It is important that a sentence imposed on an offender reflect the harm which his or her offences cause. The harm that A describes was entirely foreseeable and understandable given the nature of the indecent assaults, and the relationship between the offender and A, a relationship where the offender had power over A by reason of his position in the school.
	
	
	The offender relied on his good character at trial. A number of witnesses were called, all of whom expressed the opinion that the allegations made against the offender were inconsistent with their assessment of his character. Each, however, gave evidence that, had the offender said those things which appeared in the recording made by C, they would have to admit that their assessment of the character of the accused was flawed. The concessions made by the character witnesses were clearly correct. They did not know the true character of the accused because they did not know that the accused had a tendency to have a state of mind of sexual attraction to the boys at school, and to act upon that sexual attraction.
	
	
	A letter, today, was tendered by Mr Walsh. That letter was written by the offender’s sister. She suggests that without exception a number of people who know the offender would have wished to testify that there has never been a glance, an awkward moment, an instance from which her brother’s behaviour has been questioned.
	
	
	Those people, and perhaps even the offender’s sister, were not present at the trial. They have expressed their opinion to the offender’s sister not knowing exactly what the accused did, not knowing that there was overwhelming evidence that he had done what C did, and that a jury has been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, as would I have been, that the offender did what A alleged.
	
	
	In any case, as Mr Walsh concedes, it was the offender’s good character which facilitated the commission of the offences in the first place. That is not to say, that I have ignored what the offender has done in his life. In particular, that there has been no suggestion since he ceased teaching at St Patrick’s College that he has committed any other offence of this kind, or indeed any offence at all.
	
	
	The offender is now 79 years of age. He left school at 17 and for many years worked as a teacher in various schools both in New South Wales and Queensland. After his position as a teacher at St Patrick’s College was terminated he began work as a lecturer at a tertiary education institute. He has now retired from that job. Before I refused him bail he lived with friends in the Wallacia area and he intends to return there, or to another friend’s address, upon his release from custody.
	
	
	A feature of the presentence report is the offender’s continued denial of guilt in these matters. He continues to profess his innocence even where he knows the accuracy of the transcript of the conversation he had with C which was tendered in the trial.
	
	
	Of course, he is not to be punished for pleading not guilty. Nor is he to be punished for the resulting need that the complainants, particularly A, to go through the experience of giving evidence at a jury trial.
	
	
	But his lack of remorse is relevant, not because it is an aggravating feature that he is not sorry for what he has done, but because there is no mitigation flowing from the offender saying that he was sorry for the harm that he has caused, particularly to A.
	
	
	Despite this lack of remorse there does appear to be a low risk of reoffending, not because the offender says that he is going to take steps not to do in the future what he admits he has done in the past, but because he is old and unlikely to be put in a position in the future where he can commit offences of this type. In that sense he does have good prospects of rehabilitation despite failing to acknowledge the obvious - that he did what he has been found guilty of doing.
	
	
	Mr Walsh made submissions regarding the relevance of his client’s age. It is certainly not the law that the prospect of an accused dying in gaol prevents an appropriate sentence being imposed.
	
	
	On the other hand I do take into account that prisons are not places of luxury. Prisons are not places which old men going to prison for the first time would find comfortable. The offender is currently held in protection. There is a risk that he will serve the entirety of his sentence in that manner and a risk that if he does, that will involve harsher conditions of custody than would otherwise be the case. I have taken both of those risks into account.
	
	
	Mr Walsh made a number of appropriate concessions. I have already referred to his concession that the offender’s good character facilitated the commission of the offence. Mr Walsh also conceded that his client’s conduct represented a gross breach of trust. He was a teacher at the school. His victims were vulnerable because of their age and the fact that they were students at the school and the relationship between the two made the impact of the offending more serious.
	
	
	Mr Walsh conceded that the four offences for which I must sentence the offender were not isolated acts.
	
	
	I should say something as to the objective gravity of the first three offences on the indictment, those concerning indecent assaults on A. We now know that the extent of harm suffered by the victim of an offence is not always directly related to how Courts have traditionally regarded the seriousness of physical contact amounting to an indecent assault. But with that qualification other forms of sexual connection covered by s 81 of the Crimes Act have been regarded in the past and I will regard them for the purposes of these remarks on sentence as more serious.
	
	
	I do not regard all three offences as of equal seriousness. The action of the offender pushing A’s head down towards his penis such that his penis actually touched the face of A was a particularly intimate action as far as A was concerned, and, as I have already mentioned, it was that act which caused A to call out for his mother.
	
	
	Count 3 on the indictment is more serious than counts 1 and 2 looking at matters from an objective point of view.    Accepting that a range is not a point, I also accept Mr Walsh’s submission that the three offences are in the midrange of objective seriousness.
	
	
	Submissions were made regarding delay. I have already mentioned the reason for the delay in prosecuting the offender for the offences involving A. The reason for delay involving the offence concerning C is different. C did go to the authorities. Police and Youth and Community Services became involved, but for reasons which are not entirely clear, even though at least some people had actual copies of the recording, a decision was taken not to prosecute C.
	
	
	There has been a considerable delay between the offending and today when the offender is to be sentenced for what he did. This is a relevant factor but not a strongly mitigating one. There is no evidence that having been asked to leave the school the offender has spent the intervening years fearing the knock on the door which would ultimately lead to this day coming. He appears to have got on with his life, unconcerned that he might have to face punishment for what he did.
	
	
	Although the offences involving A all occurred as one continuous course of conduct, there were three separate acts. Each separate act added to the harm caused to A. Each separate act was a different act of criminality. It was objectively worse for the offender to commit those three offences rather than just one. Partial accumulation is required. The offender should not get the impression that having committed one offence he can do two other offences without being separately punished for them.
	
	
	It was implicit in Mr Walsh’s submissions that a custodial sentence was required. I have had no trouble coming to that conclusion. These offences, even applying olden day sentencing principles and ranges, are such that a custodial sentence is required to reflect the objective gravity of the offender’s conduct, and to deter others who may wish to give vent to their sexual urges by committing sexual assaults upon those under their authority. This sentence should act as a deterrent to such people.
	
	
	It is one of the fundamental aspects of sentencing that we impose sentence to protect the community and members of it, particularly vulnerable members of society such as children who are vulnerable to the predations of their teachers who seek inappropriate outlets for their sexual urges.
	
	
	There are special circumstances in this case, I referred to two, the likelihood that the offender will spend his time in custody in protection and the fact that this is the offender’s first time in custody.
	
	
	I will impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment, but before I announce the indicative sentences and the aggregate sentences I wish to return to the beginning. These sentences would be much longer but for the law which binds me as to the appropriate sentencing range for offences committed some time ago.
	
	
	The indicative sentences are as follows:
	
	
	For count 1, 18 months’ imprisonment;
	
	
	For count 2, 18 months’ imprisonment;
	
	
	For count 3, two years’ imprisonment;
	
	
	For count 8, six months imprisonment.
	
	
	I impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment consisting of a non‑parole period of 18 months with a head sentence of two and half years that is to date from 12 May 2017 and so the non-parole period will expire on 11 November 2018 on which day the offender is to be released to parole.

6321447,NSW Police v Scott John Seward [2017] NSWLC 16,"Judgment

INTRODUCTION


	
	The offender Scott John Seward pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and is to be sentenced in respect of one charge of dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage by deception contrary to section 192E(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900. That offence carries with it, if dealt with on indictment, a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. As the matter is being disposed of in the Local Court, the maximum penalty is a fine of $11,000 and or imprisonment for 2 years or both. In addition, the offender has indicated an intention to plead guilty to a charge of publishing false/misleading material to obtain a financial advantage contrary to section 192G(b) and has asked the court to take that offence into account on a Form 1 when sentencing for the principal offence pursuant to section 192E(1)(b).
	
	
	In undertaking this sentencing exercise I have considered the prosecution facts sheet that was tendered without objection and the written submissions and supporting documents submitted by the offender’s solicitor. In addition, I have heard oral submissions from both Mr Sutton for the offender and Sergeant Sala for the prosecution.
	


THE FACTS


	
	The offending before the court in essence arises out of breaches of the National Rugby League (NRL) Salary Cap by the Parramatta National Rugby League Club. That club is one that competes in the NRL and is known and will be referred to in these reasons as the Parramatta Eels. To understand the factual matrix of the offending it is necessary to briefly touch upon the relevant corporate structure pertaining to the Parramatta Eels. The Parramatta Eels are wholly owned by the Parramatta Leagues Club. The two organisations are separate legal entities. Each of the Parramatta Eels and the Parramatta Leagues Club has a board of directors. At all relevant times, those boards were identical in their composition. As I understand it, the rugby league club relies upon funds being provided to it by the Leagues Club so that it can operate within the NRL. Put simply, the Parramatta Leagues Club funds and is financially responsible for the operation of the Parramatta Eels. The Parramatta Eels are of course subject to the rules and regulations that are prescribed by the NRL. These rules include compliance with a salary cap. This is an amount of money that an NRL club is permitted to pay its contracted players each season. The salary cap is apparently aimed at ensuring that wealthy clubs are not able to use funds at their disposal to buy the best players in the league. The measure is aimed at keeping all clubs on a relatively even playing level and seeking to ensure a competition that is balanced.
	
	
	In 2011 the offender, who was apparently a long term rugby league enthusiast, obtained employment with the Parramatta Eels as the Manager of Membership and Commercial Business. In 2013 he was promoted to the position of Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The facts reveal that at the time that he commenced his employment as CEO, he was advised that the club was salary cap compliant.
	
	
	Regrettably, and within a short time of his commencing duties as CEO, the offender began to receive demands from both current and former players and their managers for the payment of outstanding sums of cash that had been agreed to be paid to them. These agreements to pay extra funds to players and managers were outside of the NRL salary cap and were clear breaches thereof. They are referred to in the facts as third party payments. Importantly, there is no suggestion that the offender was involved in any way in these arrangements and he had no prior knowledge of them. Rather, the offender inherited what was plainly a completely unsatisfactory circumstance the responsibility for which lay at the feet of others. Those other persons are not identified in the police facts. Upon his becoming aware of what was plainly a serious breach of the NRL rules, the offender sought assistance and guidance from the Boards of Directors only to be told to “Fix the problem or they would find someone who could”. Whilst the offender had no prior knowledge of the predicament he had inherited, the words attributed to unnamed members of the Board of Directors certainly indicate that they did.
	
	
	What is clear in my view, is that the offender was, as the CEO of the Parramatta Eels, completely out of his depth. He had not previously held the role of a CEO and was plainly in a position where he was left unsupported by his Board of Directors. A letter from his father addressed to the court and dated 31 May 2017 noted: “I firmly believed he did not have the experience or qualifications required to fill the position”. I agree with the offender’s father’s assessment. The offender is plainly entitled to feel significantly let down by both his predecessors and by the Board of Directors to whom he was ultimately responsible. He was at the commencement of his term as CEO 38 years of age. He was the sole provider for his young family and was through his employment, fulfilling a childhood dream. As the offender himself remarked in his letter of apology to the court, “The dream quickly became a nightmare”. I was told by Mr Sutton that despite repeated requests by the offender, the Board was tardy in providing him a formal contract of employment. This is in a context where the offender was told to “Fix the problem or they would find someone who could”. Given that he was his family’s sole breadwinner, it is not difficult to understand how his moral compass became so significantly compromised. I accept that he felt a degree of desperation and coercion at the time that the offences were committed. His letter to the court acknowledges this when he remarks “I wish I had been stronger and stood up for what I knew to be right”.
	
	
	By January 2014 the offender had been provided with a list of the outstanding cash payments that were due to players and their managers. The total amount outstanding was $589,000.00 and that amount needed to be paid in cash. No doubt the offender was well aware by this point that the club was in serious breach of its salary cap obligations. It is of course to be observed that such a breach is not a crime, but rather a breach of the rules of a sporting organisation, compliance with which grounds the right to participate in that organisation’s competition. In any event, and after attempts at attracting wealthy business people to the club to provide the cash due to pay the players failed, the offender, whilst being continually pressed for demands for cash from players and managers became desperate to source the funds. The facts reveal that he then consulted the Parramatta Eels football and logistics team manager, Jason Irvine, for assistance. The offender was told by Mr Irvine that a club supporter, who was the owner of a landscaping and maintenance company, which already provided services to both the Parramatta Eels and the Parramatta Leagues Club, would be prepared to assist in meeting the player and player manager demands. The offender requested Mr Irvine speak with the supporter and request him to issue false invoices for landscaping work that the offender would then authorise for payment so enabling some payments to be made. The supporter was of the belief that all those in authority at both the Parramatta Eels and the Parramatta Leagues Club were aware of this arrangement. The offender did not have any direct conversations with the supporter and Mr Irvine liaised with him at all times. Over a short period of time in 2014 the offender requested (through Mr Irvine) that two invoices be issued to the Parramatta Eels for various services that were not supplied to the club. The invoices were false and were for the sole purpose of being able to make cash payments to players and managers. The total amount of the invoices was $76,000.00. Upon receipt of the invoices the offender authorised payment whereupon the invoices were then forwarded on to the accounts department for payment. The money obtained was paid into the account of Mr Irvine, who subsequently paid it out in cash to players and managers. At no time did the offender receive any of the money for himself.
	
	
	Sometime later in an almost identical fashion, the offender engaged, along with Mr Irvine, in a further fraud whereby another club supporter agreed to provide false invoices for payment. Those invoices were in the total amount of $ 145,106.50. They were authorised for payment as the earlier invoices had been, and in due course the money received was paid to players and managers. Again, no money was retained by the offender himself.
	
	
	In 2015 the offender was told by Mr Irvine that another supporter would be willing to assist the club with paying players outstanding cash amounts. The offender then requested this supporter, via Mr Irvine, to inflate a contract for the supply of certain services to the Parramatta Eels. The contract was inflated by the amount of $30,000.00 per year for a period of 4 years. The inflated amount in the contract was to be used for the payment of players outside the salary cap. The offender again had no direct dealings with this supporter. This inflated contract was signed on the 16 March 2015. It is this conduct that is the subject of the offence that is to be dealt with on a Form 1. The accused resigned from the Parramatta Eels in June 2015 prior to any invoices being received by the club in respect of this contract. I accept that his resignation was as a consequence of his being unable to deal with the stress to which he had been subject and his inability to continue engaging in the conduct that now brings him before the Court.
	
	
	In early 2016 the offender approached the CEO of the NRL, Mr Greenberg. The offender’s conscience by now having got the better of him, he made a full and complete disclosure to senior NRL officials over a number of weeks as to the conduct that he and others had engaged in at the Parramatta Eels, both before and during the time that he was engaged there as the CEO. The taking of this step by the offender involved considerable courage for which he ought to be commended.
	
	
	The facts reveal that he was both honest and expansive with the NRL. As a consequence of his disclosures to the NRL, information was passed to the New South Wales Police Force and a criminal investigation was commenced. In July 2016 officers from the New South Wales Police approached the offender in relation to the allegations of false invoicing and fraud. He made immediate admissions and voluntarily provided police with a statement over a number of days. The police facts indicate that in their view, the entire matter would not have come to light without the full and frank disclosures made by the offender. This is of course a matter of some real significance to which I will shortly return.
	


OBJECTIVE SERIOUSNESS


	
	In assessing the objective seriousness I must have regard to the maximum penalty prescribed by the legislature, the amount of money involved, the length of time over which the offence was committed, the offender’s motive, the degree of planning, and the fact that this matter involved a breach of trust. Plainly, the amount of money involved is substantial, being $221,106.50. In this regard I note that it was indicated to me during the submissions that the loss was one occasioned to the Parramatta Leagues Club, it being the entity which funded the operation of the Parramatta Eels. Of real importance is the fact that had the Parramatta Eels honoured the agreements they had reached with players and managers for payments outside the salary cap, then those payments would have been made by the Parramatta Leagues Club in any event. As I understand it, those agreements were enforceable in the traditional way notwithstanding that they involved a breach of the NRL rules. As was explained to me by the prosecutor, those agreements could not be honoured because to do so would have exposed the Parramatta Eels as salary cap cheats. No doubt such exposure would have resulted in serious sanction by the NRL. I note that in due course the cheating was uncovered and sanctions were put in place including the loss of premiership points and the removal of the Board of Directors.
	
	
	The offending occurred over a 7 month period between November 2014 and June of 2015. The offender’s motive was not one of personal gain, other than so far as it impacted upon his continuing employment, but rather, to fix up what was a diabolical mess that he had inherited from others. Plainly, there was a degree of planning involved in the offending and, as the offender himself acknowledges, there was a significant breach of trust. Given the fact that the offender received no actual financial benefit, the fact that he had no involvement in the initial salary cap breaches which created the environment giving rise to his criminal behaviour, and the fact he was personally and professionally ill equipped for the role he was undertaking, I have concluded that his offending can be assessed at a point at or towards the lower end of objective seriousness for offences of this type.
	
	
	This finding is despite the quantum involved and the period of the offending. In coming to this conclusion I have had regard to the seriousness with which offences under this section are generally regarded. When senior employees such as the offender commit offences of this type, custodial sentences often result. This however is an unusual and unique case that can be readily distinguished from others brought before the court. The most important distinguishing feature is that the Board members, or at least some of them, being the member elected representatives of the victim organisations, connived in the commission of the offence. Those Board members had, prior to the offender’s engagement as CEO, created the circumstance that they then pressured the offender to resolve, and in his seeking to do so, the offence before the court was committed. Their willingness to allow the commission of the offence, places these victims in a vastly different category to the victims of almost all other offences of this type.
	


THE OFFENDER’S SUBJECTIVE CASE


	
	The offender is aged 41 years. He is married with 2 children, aged 7 and 10. His wife suffers from a debilitating illness, although she is apparently symptom free at this time. Prior to coming to work in Sydney for the Parramatta Eels, the offender had worked in sporting administration with the Western Bulldogs, an AFL team based in Melbourne. Upon his resignation he returned to Melbourne and was unemployed for about 5 months. He then obtained employment as the General Manager of the Melbourne Cricket Club – Kew Sports Club. He remained in that employment until he was charged with the matters before the court, following which his employment was terminated. He is currently employed doing casual work in a supermarket. He continues to reside in Victoria. The material reveals that those who know him well observed deterioration in his mental health following his taking up the position of CEO with the Parramatta Eels. Subsequent to his resignation he has been treated for depression. He continues under the care of a psychologist who describes him as someone who is unlikely to reoffend. He requires ongoing counselling and psychotherapy to rebuild his life personally, socially and professionally. His prognosis is described by his treating psychologist as “good in light of his intelligent and reasoned approach to recovery and the support of significant others”.
	


ASSISTANCE TO AUTHORITIES


	
	Looming large in this matter is the issue of the discount on penalty that ought to be afforded the offender as a consequence of the assistance he has provided to authorities. Plainly that assistance has been substantial. It has long been the case that a sentencing court is able to extend leniency to an offender who has provided assistance to authorities. Sometimes that leniency will be substantial, especially if it is motivated by genuine remorse and contrition: see R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243. I accept that it is in this case. In extending leniency for assistance courts must ensure that the ultimate outcome is not disproportionate to the actual offending. As in any sentencing task, the court must strive to impose a penalty that is, in the final analysis, a fair and just one. The discount for assistance can result in the imposition of a less serious sentencing option and is not limited to the imposition of a numerically lesser penalty. Relevantly in this case, any discount for assistance must also have regard to the voluntary disclosure by the offender of his guilt in circumstances where the facts reveal that had that disclosure not been made, the offences before the court would not have come to light: see R v Ellis (1986) NSWLR 603; Panetta v R [2016] NSWCCA 85. There is an obvious public interest in such a course being taken by an offender (see AB v The Queen (1990) 198 CLR 111) and courts should reward an offender in such circumstances by meaningful reductions in penalty.
	
	
	Section of 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 indicates how a court is to deal with the issue of assistance to authorities. Subsection 23(2) sets out the matters a court must consider in determining whether a lesser penalty is to be imposed. Subsection 23(3) provides that any lesser penalty must not be unreasonably disproportionate, and subsection 23(4) requires a court that imposes a lesser penalty to indicate what penalty would otherwise have been imposed save for the assistance. So far as the factors to be taken into account pursuant to subsection 23(2) are concerned, I note the significance and usefulness of the offender’s assistance is high; that the prosecution accept that the information he has provided is truthful, complete and reliable; that the nature and extent of his assistance is high; that his assistance was offered in a timely manner and that the assistance relates solely to the offence before the court. It is not suggested in any of the material that there has been any promise of future assistance by the offender. Whilst the written submissions of the offender’s solicitors make reference in paragraph 48 to promised assistance, those submissions provide a mere recitation of the relevant law and do not suggest that there will be assistance to authorities by the offender in the future.
	
	
	As will be plain, many of the section 23 factors that must be considered operate favourably for the offender and in my assessment he must be given very significant leniency in the disposition of this matter. It is of course, necessary for me to indicate the penalty that would have been imposed but for the offender’s assistance and I will shortly return to this aspect.
	


THE MEDIA


	
	Mr Sutton submitted a large number of excerpts of media articles touching upon the offender and his conduct all of which have been considered. His submissions suggest that the media has hypothesized that the offending was for personal benefit in circumstances where this was not in fact the case. Sergeant Sala submitted that the media coverage did not amount to extra curial punishment. My consideration of the material submitted by Mr Sutton does not allow me to draw the conclusion he urges and I am in agreement with the submission of Sergeant Sala. While I have no doubt that the publicity and media coverage has caused the offender significant humiliation and embarrassment I am not of the view that it amounts to extra curial punishment such as would warrant some consideration being given in respect of the sentence to be imposed. In R v Wran [2016] NSWSC 1015, Harrison J reflected on what he described as “a sustained and unpleasant campaign by some of the daily newspapers circulating in Sydney” towards the offender in that case. He referred to “distasteful and wholly misleading headlines” that made allegations about “her criminality, sexual conduct and reputation that had no basis in fact”.  He accepted in that case, that the treatment of the offender by the media, and its disproportionate intensity, went beyond the traditional case of adverse publicity such as to warrant a lesser punishment being imposed. I am not satisfied from what has been provided that the media treatment in this case goes beyond traditional adverse publicity and I do not propose to mitigate the sentence to be imposed on this account.
	


THE STATUTORY CONSIDERATIONS


	
	The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 mandates that the court is to take into account the aggravating and mitigating factors set out in section 21A of the Act, along with any other objective factor that affects the relevant seriousness of the offending. So far as the aggravating factors in section 21A(2) are concerned, I note that the offender abused his position of trust, that the offending involved a series of criminal acts, and that the offending was planned. The mitigating factors pursuant to section 21A(3) are that the offender does not have any record of previous convictions, was a person of good character, is unlikely to reoffend, has good prospects of rehabilitation, is remorseful and has accepted responsibility for his actions, has acknowledged the loss caused by his actions, has pleaded guilty, and has provided assistance. All of these relevant aggravating and mitigating factors will be taken into account.    
	
	
	Section 3A sets out the purposes for which the court may impose a sentence. Those purposes are:
	



	
	to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence,
	
	
	to prevent crime by deterring the offender and others from committing similar offences,
	
	
	to protect the community from the offender,
	
	
	to promote the rehabilitation of the offender,
	
	
	to make the offender accountable for his or her actions,
	
	
	to denounce the conduct of the offender,
	
	
	to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community
	



	
	In the unusual circumstances of this case, all of these purposes will be taken into account to the extent that they are relevant. So far as punishment is concerned, the offender’s voluntary disclosures have meant a very significant self-imposed punishment. He lost his employment and his future prospects of employment, particularly in the field of sports administration must be regarded as limited. Given the highly unusual and unique circumstances of this case, I am not of the view that general deterrence has a significant role to play. For the reasons earlier articulated this is a fraud case that is far removed from the usual fraud cases that this court encounters. Further, I note that the defendant’s mental health does not make him a suitable vehicle to be made an example of as a means of deterring others. I am satisfied that specific deterrence has no role to play given my view that he will not reoffend and in all the circumstances the community does not require protection from the offender. I am also of the view that the sentence to be imposed will promote the offender’s rehabilitation. He has already been made accountable for his conduct and the orders I will make will provide sufficient denunciation. So far as the harm to the victim is concerned, I have already remarked on this aspect earlier in these reasons.
	


THE PARTIES SUBMISSIONS


	
	Mr Sutton for the offender submitted that I would deal with the matter by recording a bare conviction pursuant to section 10A of Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act after balancing all of the relevant objective and subjective considerations. He particularly stressed the circumstances giving rise to the offending, the voluntary disclosure made by the offender, the fact that there was no personal gain by him, his mental health, the fact that he was a person of good character and his early plea of guilty. Sergeant Sala noted that in cases of this type some form of custodial sentence would normally be appropriate. In broad terms, and noting that each case must be dealt with on its merits, I agree with that submission. She did however fairly acknowledge that in all the circumstances of this case, the section 5 threshold requiring a custodial penalty to be imposed had not been crossed. She accepted that there was no actual benefit that had been obtained by the offender and that as a consequence of his conduct there was a significant detriment to his employment prospects. She conceded the offender had provided significant assistance to police. She placed weight in her submissions on the need for general deterrence. It was argued that the matter was objectively serious due to the offenders’ position, the large amount of money involved and the fact that his behaviour would have been hard to identify in the normal course. In making that submission she nevertheless properly conceded that his criminality was lowered as a consequence of the fact that he had himself identified it to authorities. Implicit in the submissions of both the prosecutor and the offender’s counsel was that a conviction be recorded.
	


CONCLUSION


	
	It is to be observed that the submissions of the parties whether they involve a request for leniency or otherwise do not bind the court. A court will be guided and assisted by submissions but in the final determination a decision as to whether or not a conviction ought to be recorded is a matter solely for the sentencer. At its core, a sentence must be individual and it must fit the crime. In imposing it a court must acknowledge the importance of its public dimension and the maintenance of public confidence in the justice system. Somewhat unusually I have determined in this matter to impose a lesser penalty than that suggested by the offender’s solicitor. In doing so, I have borne firmly in mind the remarks of Windeyer J in Cobiac v Liddy (1969) 119 CLR 257 at 269 that “a capacity in special circumstances to avoid the rigidity of inexorable law is of the very essence of justice”, together with what was said by Spigelman CJ in R v Ingrassia (1997) 41 NSWLR 447 at 449 that “the legal and social consequences of being convicted of an offence often extend beyond the penalty imposed by the court”.
	
	
	I have decided that in all the circumstances of this case I ought not proceed to conviction and that instead I should make an order discharging the offender on condition that he enter into a good behaviour bond for a period of 2 years. In determining to take this action I have had particular regard to the following factors as prescribed by section 10(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act; the offender’s character, antecedents, age, mental condition, and the extenuating circumstances in which the offence was committed. I have also borne in mind the fact that the offending is not in its nature trivial. In having regard to other matters that I regard as proper, I have paid particular attention to the defendant’s early plea of guilty, his assistance to authorities and the affect that a conviction would have upon his already diminished employment prospects. It is important to remember that while section 10(3) mandates the factors that a court is to have regard to in dealing with an offender pursuant to the section, there is no statutory requirement that all of the factors be present prior to disposition in this way: see Hoffenberg v The District Court of New South Wales [2010] NSWCA 142, per Basten JA at [8]. Accordingly, the fact that an offence is not trivial does not give rise to some type of legislative barrier to it being disposed of in the way that I propose. I have also taken into account the offence on the Form 1 in reaching my conclusion and can indicate that had this offence not been taken into account then the term of the section 10 bond would have been for a lesser period.
	
	
	Needless to say, the more serious the offending the less scope there is for a court to deal with an offender without recording a conviction. In this case however, my view as to the compelling nature of the extenuating circumstances concerning the offending conduct leaves no room for the recording of a conviction. As was made clear in R v Mauger [2012] NSWCCA 51 by Harrison J, with whom Beazley JA (as the President then was) and McCallum J agreed, the fact that a conviction is not recorded should not “dilute or downgrade the significance of the imposition of a s10 bond”. There are onerous consequences if an offender fails to comply with a section 10 bond and it should not be assumed that because this court has decided not to record a conviction that the sentence is automatically lenient. R v Mauger (supra) also makes clear that the prospect of a conviction having a detrimental consequence upon employment is something that I am entitled to take into account and I have done so. R v Mauger (supra) is further authority for the proposition that the imposition of a bond even without conviction can meet the need for denunciation and general deterrence in an appropriate case. In my assessment this is such a case, particularly when one has regard to the factual matrix of the offending and the assistance that the offender provided to authorities. I have concluded that such a disposition will not affront community standards, particularly when the facts of the matter are made clear, or that it would be otherwise inappropriate. I propose to order the dismissal of the charge be conditional upon the offender entering into a bond to be of good behaviour. Such a bond will satisfy the need for denunciation and general deterrence and as I have earlier found, specific deterrence has no role to play. To comply with the provisions of section 23(4)(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I state that without the significant assistance that has been provided by the offender a more serious penalty would have been imposed being a conviction and the imposition of a section 9 bond.
	


ORDERS


	
	Re Sequence 1 - I find the offence proved but deem it inexpedient to inflict any punishment. The charge will be dismissed pursuant to the provisions of section 10(1)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act conditional on the defendant entering into a bond to be of good behaviour for a period of 2 years.
	
	
	Re Sequence 2 – Taken into account on a Form 1.

THE OFFENCES

The offenders Sulayman Khalid, Jibryl Almaouie and IM


	
	Sulayman Khalid (“Khalid”), Jibryl Almaouie (“Jibryl”) and a third offender to whom I shall refer as “IM”, have each pleaded guilty to an indictment in the following terms:
	


Between about 7 November 2014 and 18 December 2014, at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, did conspire with each other and Mohamed Al Maouie, Ibrahim Ghazzawy, Farhad Said and diverse others to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act (or acts).


	
	That offence is contrary to ss 11.5 and 101.6(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) (“the Code”) and carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. It should be noted at the outset that the Crown did not submit that a life sentence was warranted in the case of any of these three offenders.
	
	
	In addition, Jibryl has pleaded guilty to a separate indictment containing the following counts:
	


1.   On or about 18 December 2014, at Condell Park in the State of New South Wales, did possess a firearm, namely, .303 British calibre ENFIELD model 4, repeating bolt action riffle, serial number 59L0792, not being authorised to do so by a licence or permit (count 1).

2.   On or about 18 December 2014, at Condell Park in the State of New South Wales, did possess a shortened firearm, namely, a shortened 12 gauge COOEY model 840 break open action single shot, shotgun, serial number 72538, that was not a pistol, without being authorised to do so by a permit (count 2).

3.   On or about 18 December 2014, at Condell Park in the State of New South Wales, did possess a firearm that was not registered, namely, .303 British Calibre ENFIELD model 4, repeating bolt action riffle, serial number 59L0792 (count 3).

4.   On or about 18 December 2014, at Condell Park in the State of New South Wales, did possess a firearm that was not registered, namely, a shortened 12 gauge COOEY model 840 break open action single shot shotgun, serial number 72538 (count 4).


	
	Each of counts 1-4 are offences contrary to the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW) (“the FA”) and the respective maximum penalties, are as follows:
	



	
	count 1 (FA s. 7A(1) – maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years;
	
	
	count 2 (FA s. 62(1)(b)) – maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years;
	
	
	counts 3 and 4 (FA s. 36(1)) – maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years.
	



	
	At Jibryl’s request, I have also taken into account the following matters contained in a Form 1 all of which were committed on 19 December 2014:
	



	
	possess unauthorised firearm, namely a 12 gauge LAMBER break open action double barrel under and over shotgun, not being authorised to do so by a licence or permit, contrary to s. 7A(1) of the FA;
	
	
	possess unregistered firearm, namely a 12 gauge LAMBER break open action double barrel under and over shotgun, contrary to s. 36(1) of the FA;
	
	
	possess ammunition for a firearm without holding a licence or permit for a firearm which takes that ammunition and without being authorised to possess that ammunition by licence or permit, contrary to s. 65(3) of the FA; and
	
	
	not keeping a firearm safely, contrary to s. 39 of the FA.
	



	
	Jibryl’s commission of the various offences contrary to the FA are part of the conspiracy to which he has pleaded guilty. In these circumstances, the Crown and senior counsel for Jibryl agreed that any sentences imposed in respect of those offences should be wholly concurrent with any sentence imposed in respect of the conspiracy. There is some difficulty in giving effect to this agreed position, arising from the fact that Jibryl was taken into custody in respect of the charges contrary to the FA on 23 December 2014. He has remained in custody since that time and accordingly, any sentences imposed for those offences can, and should, be backdated to commence on that day. However, he was not charged with the conspiracy offence until 10 December 2015, almost 12 months later. It is not possible to backdate the sentence for the conspiracy to commence on 23 December 2014 because Jibryl was not, at that time, charged with that offence.
	
	
	Following the conclusion of the sentence proceedings, the Crown filed written submissions in relation to this issue and suggested that the result which the parties agreed was appropriate could be achieved by:
	



	
	firstly imposing sentences for the offences contrary to the FA;
	
	
	then imposing the sentence for the conspiracy and in doing so, making an allowance for the sentences imposed in (i) and imposing a total aggregate sentence.
	



	
	No submissions were received on behalf of Jibryl which took issue with that approach. I have adopted the Crown’s suggestion of imposing sentences for the offences contrary to the FA first. Whilst those sentences cannot, in the circumstances, be made wholly concurrent with the sentence to be imposed in respect of the conspiracy, I have endeavoured to structure the sentences in a way which imposes a total sentence giving effect to what the parties agree is appropriate.
	


The offenders Mohamed Al Maouie and Farhad Said


	
	Mohamed Rashad Al Maouie (“Mohamed”) and Farhad Said (“Said”) have each pleaded guilty to separate indictments in the following terms:
	


Between about 17 December 2014 and 18 December 2014 at Sydney, in the State of New South Wales, did intentionally make a document and the document was connected with the preparation for a terrorist act, knowing of that connection.


	
	That offence is contrary to s. 101.5(1) of the Code and carries a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment.
	


THE SENTENCE PROCEEDINGS


	
	I heard submissions on behalf of the Crown and each of the offenders on 3, 4, 5 and 6 October 2017, in the course of which the Crown tendered a separate statement of facts in respect of each offender. Some parts of the facts tendered against one offender were common to those tendered against some others. Rather than unnecessarily repeat parts of the facts, I have indicated where this principally arises.
	
	
	It should also be noted that although the facts were tendered by consent in each case, some specific issues were taken on behalf of Jibryl as to discreet parts of them. I have identified where those issues arose and have expressed by conclusions in relation to them.
	


FEDERAL SENTENCING PROVISIONS


	
	I am required to sentence each of the offenders in accordance with Part 1B of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (“the Act”) [1] . There are a number of provisions within that Part to which I should make reference.
	
	
	Section 16A of the Act provides (inter alia) as follows:
	


16A Matters to which court to have regard when passing sentence etc.--federal offences

(1) In determining the sentence to be passed, or the order to be made, in respect of any person for a federal offence, a court must impose a sentence or make an order that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence.

(2) In addition to any other matters, the court must take into account such of the following matters as are relevant and known to the court:

(a) the nature and circumstances of the offence;

(b) other offences (if any) that are required or permitted to be taken into account;

(c) if the offence forms part of a course of conduct consisting of a series of criminal acts of the same or a similar character--that course of conduct;

(d) the personal circumstances of any victim of the offence;

(e) any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence;

(ea) if an individual who is a victim of the offence has suffered harm as a result of the offence--any victim impact statement for the victim;

(f) the degree to which the person has shown contrition for the offence:

(i) by taking action to make reparation for any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence; or

(ii) in any other manner;

(fa) the extent to which the person has failed to comply with:

(i) any order under subsection 23CD(1) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 ; or

(ii) any obligation under a law of the Commonwealth; or

(iii) any obligation under a law of the State or Territory applying under subsection 68(1) of the Judiciary Act 1903 ;

about pre-trial disclosure, or ongoing disclosure, in proceedings relating to the offence;

(g) if the person has pleaded guilty to the charge in respect of the offence--that fact;

(h) the degree to which the person has co-operated with law enforcement agencies in the investigation of the offence or of other offences;

(j) the deterrent effect that any sentence or order under consideration may have on the person;

(ja) the deterrent effect that any sentence or order under consideration may have on other persons;

(k) the need to ensure that the person is adequately punished for the offence;

(m) the character, antecedents, age, means and physical or mental condition of the person;

(n) the prospect of rehabilitation of the person;

(p) the probable effect that any sentence or order under consideration would have on any of the person's family or dependants.

...


	
	Under s. 17A, I may only impose a term of imprisonment if I am satisfied that this is the only appropriate sentence. I am satisfied that this is the case in respect of each offender.
	
	
	Section 19AG applies to each of the federal offences to which the respective offenders have pleaded guilty [2] . It requires that I fix a single non-parole period for each of the federal offences which is at least three quarters of the head sentence which is imposed.
	
	
	In accordance with s. 16F of the Act, I must explain the sentence imposed upon each offender. I must also warn each offender, pursuant to s. 105C of the Code, that an application may be made for a continuing detention order, requiring the offender to be detained after the completion of any such sentence.
	


SENTENCING PROVISIONS SPECIFIC TO IM


	
	As discussed further below, IM is currently 17 years of age and was aged 14 at the time of his offending. He is therefore a “child” within the meaning of s. 20C(1) of the Act which is in the following terms [3] :
	


20C Offences by children and young persons

(1) A child or young person who, in a State or Territory, is charged with or convicted of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth may be tried, punished or otherwise dealt with as if the offence were an offence against a law of the State or Territory.


	
	The effect of s. 20C(1) of the Act is to allow me to sentence IM having regard to those options for which provision is made in the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW) (“the CCPA”) and the Young Offenders Act 1997 (NSW). However as previously noted, I have come to the view that a term of imprisonment is the only appropriate sentence.
	
	
	Section 6 of the CCPA sets out a number of principles which must be taken into account when exercising functions under that Act. Senior counsel for IM urged that I have regard to those matters. To the extent that they are relevant to IM, I have done so, although they are essentially a reflection of common law principles governing the sentencing of young offenders which I have discussed further below.
	
	
	Pursuant to s. 19 of the CCPA, I may make an order directing that that IM serve any term of imprisonment as a juvenile offender beyond the age of 18 years and up to the age of 21 years. To make that order I must be satisfied that there are special circumstances within the meaning of s. 19(4) of the CCPA. Senior counsel for IM submitted that I would be satisfied that there are special circumstances within the meaning of s. 19(4)(b) and/or (c). The Crown made no submissions to the contrary. I am satisfied on the evidence in IM’s case, which I have discussed more fully below, that if he were committed to a correctional centre before turning 21 years of age there would be an unacceptable risk of him suffering physical or psychological harm. I am therefore satisfied that there are special circumstances within the meaning of s. 19(4)(c) of the CCPA allowing me to order that he serve any sentence of imprisonment as a juvenile offender after he has attained the age of 18 years, and up to attaining the age of 21 years. I will give effect to that finding in the orders that I make in IM’s case.
	


General sentencing principles 


	
	There are obviously individual considerations which impact upon the cases of the respective offenders, both objectively and subjectively. Equally, there are also a number of principles which are of general application to sentencing for offences of this nature. Those principles, which I have applied in determining an appropriate sentence in the case of each offender, may be summarised as follows.
	
	
	The primary considerations on sentence in matters of this nature are the protection of the community, the punishment of the offender, the denunciation of the offending, and deterrence, both general and specific [4] . Subjective circumstances and mitigating factors, including considerations of rehabilitation, are to be given less weight [5] .
	
	
	The religious and/or ideological motivation of an offender is relevant to the issue of community protection, as well as to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending [6] . Consequently, where it is not established that an offender has resiled from previously held extremist views, the element of community protection will assume even greater importance [7] . As previously noted, weight must be given to the need for general deterrence. This remains so, even if the force of ideological or religious motivations and considerations are such that deterrence may not be effective [8] .
	
	
	Matters relevant to assessing the objective seriousness of offending of this nature will include:
	



	
	the degree of planning, research, complexity and sophistication involved, together with the extent of the offender’s commitment to carry out the act(s) of terrorism;
	
	
	the period of time involved, including the duration of the involvement of the particular offender;
	
	
	the depth and extent of the radicalisation of the offender as demonstrated (inter alia) by the possession of extremist material and/or the communication of such views to others; and
	
	
	the extent to which the offender has been responsible, by whatever means, for indoctrinating or attempting to indoctrinate others, and the vulnerability or otherwise of the target(s) of the indoctrination, be it actual or intended [9] .
	



	
	In light of the charge to which Mohamed and Said have pleaded guilty, the following additional factors are relevant:
	



	
	the volume, detail and accuracy of the information contained in any document(s);
	
	
	the nature and extent of the harm capable of being caused by the act(s) described within the document(s);
	
	
	the nature and extent of the publication of the document(s); and
	
	
	the state of mind of the offender [10] .
	



	
	I turn to consider the cases of each individual offender.

THE EVIDENCE TENDERED BY THE CROWN

The facts


	
	The statement of facts tendered by the Crown against Khalid was in the following terms:
	


BACKGROUND

A.   Ideology

1.   Sulayman Khalid (“the offender”), “IM” and Jibryl Almaouie (together, “the conspirators”) adhere to the religious ideology of violent jihad. Specifically, they adhere to the religious ideology of Wahhabi-Salafism. This is the ideology that inspires ISIS (the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria), Al-Qaeda and like‑minded groups and their supporters. [30] 

2.   The cause that was to be advanced in the proposed terrorist act or acts was that of violent jihad. The essential feature of the cause, which the conspirators believed to be a religious obligation, was to engage in violence to advance what they considered to be the interests of Islam. They believed Islam to be under attack from various Western countries, in Syria and the Middle East, and also in Australia. They also believed that those who died pursuing violent jihad were martyrs, who would be rewarded in paradise.

3.   During the conspiracy period (that is, between about 7 November 2014 and 18 December 2014), each of the conspirators was committed to Islam and they often spoke about it and included it in their daily lives. Whilst the word “jihad” is used and understood amongst the wider Muslim community to mean “spiritual struggle”, the conspirators used the term (and possessed material that used the term) to mean “violent jihad”.

4.   During the period of the conspiracy and for some time before, the offender was active in seeking to advance Islam. He had actively proselytized for Islam in the street and posted videos of those activities online. His activity was known to his friends, including (amongst others) “IM”, who had a video on his phone of the offender preaching Islam in the street.

5.   The offender had publicly displayed his support for the violent jihad espoused by ISIS. One way he did so was by obtaining and wearing clothing with badges and adornments of ISIS. When police executed a search warrant at his premises on 18 December 2014, the items they found included clothing bearing identifiable ISIS markings and a series of printed A4 sheets which, when placed together, formed an almost complete ISIS banner.

6.   Furthermore, the offender had appeared on the “Insight Program” (which was televised nationally) on 12 August 2014 [31] , and supported the violent jihadi ideology of ISIS including by wearing the ISIS flag on his sleeve. His comments on that program included the following:

“Look, ISIS, they - they - they do not want to bring anything but justice, ISIS. They don’t wanna bring anything but justice. ...

Well, the Australian government is bringing - they’re bringing harm to themself and they’re bringing harm to the Australian citizens here - - - ... Well, they’re bringing physical - you know, like, whatever - anything. If they get - If they’re - if they’re gunna leave their troops in Iraq, for example - ... if they’re not gunna do anything about this, what’s happening to the Muslims, then something’s gunna happen here.”

7.   The offender had also made a YouTube video [32]  which he had posted on the internet, titled “A Direct Message to the Secret Services, A call to Taweed, Millatu Ibrahim”. [33]  In that video, which features an ISIS emblem, the offender makes a thinly veiled threat against various Western security services, including those of Australia. The “message” the offender delivered included the following:

“To all of the Muslims out there in the world, and um, I would like to forward the message, um to the secret services of our time, MI5, MI6, MI7, FBI, CIA, ASIO, um all of, the rest of the secret services, in each and every one of the countries. ...

Accept Islam as your salvation. Because, I swear to you, I swear to you, that a day will come when it will be too late. ...

You will regret, the day, you will regret the day that when Allah, he orders his angels to drag you on your faces to the pits of hell fire. This is, this is the day you will regret it. ...

In Islam, we cannot obey man-made law. We cannot obey a man that’s not ruling with the Sharia. ...

And no matter, how many, no matter how many Muslims is in prison, no matter how many Muslims are killed, no matter how many Muslims you rape, no matter how many Muslims is bombed, on top of the skies, is bombed from the skies, no matter how many things yous do to the Muslims, Islam, at the end, will become victorious. ...

Us Muslims, we know that you know the history of Islam. Us Muslims, we know that yous know that Islam is spread by the swords. That is Islam is spread by the sword. Yes or no. It did. It did spread by the swords. How can a religion not spread without using the swords? How can the religion spread without using the swords? ...

Yous come to our lands and yous bomb and rape and kill. And butcher our, and butcher the Muslims. When yous take over, and then yous calls the Muslims terrorists. Think about it, use your heads. Use your heads. Who’s the terrorists? What is the meaning of terrorism? Who are the terrorists? Are the terrorists, are the terrorists the ones that want to establish the, the, the, the law of God and get man out of this democracy, get man out of the, the chains and shackles of the democracy, out of the man-made law system, out of the injust system. ...

The Islamic State. And if yous look, if you actually just look, at the Islamic law and the Sharia law, then yous will find, yous will find there is wisdom behind it. ...

But yous will not be able to distinguish the light of Allah and those secret services, I will leave you with one thing and I will give you one more message. ...

Its either you will become a Muslim, and you will believe in Allah, or you will die by the sword. ... [indistinguishable] Islam will be victorious. Victory is for Islam. Victory is for the Muslims.”

8.   The “Direct Message to the Secret Services” video was one of 25 published online by the offender between 25 May 2013 and 7 December 2014, the majority of which show the offender preaching and discussing Islam.

9.   The offender was also the conspirator who sent religious advice and sayings to the other conspirators. For example, on 26 November 2014, the offender a message to a number of recipients that said “TIME TO WAKE UP AND TASTE THE SWEETNESS OF IMAN [34] ”, which he signed off as “Abu Bakr”.

10.   The offender promoted violent jihad as the leader of the group during many telephone communications with “IM”, during which they spoke about martyrdom and committing some form of terrorist act. He also had coded telephone conversations with Jibryl Almaouie, during which they referred to ammunition.

B.   Outline of the conspiracy

11.   The offender and the other conspirators agreed with each other and Mohamed Al Maouie, Ibrahim Ghazzawy and Farhad Said (all of whom, with others, were under investigation by the Joint Counter Terrorism Team from May 2014) to do acts in preparation for, or planning of, a terrorist act or acts. The terrorist act was to involve firearms and was to be a religiously inspired act of terrorism, namely violent jihad. The nature of the act or acts and the proposed target or targets were unresolved, but included the killing of a member or members of either the New South Wales Police Force or Australian Federal Police and/or attacks upon government buildings. 

12.   The conspiracy coalesced between about 2 November 2014 and 18 December 2014. The conspirators began planning the attacks outlined in documents located at the offender’s house on 18 December 2014.

13.   The overt acts of the offender and his co-conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy are summarised in the Table of Overt Acts, annexed at “B”. Put briefly, the conspiracy involved, amongst other actions, the following:

a)   Considering, orally and in writing, various possible forms of terrorist act including ways to carry out the act or acts (including using firearms in a direct attack or using guerrilla tactics);

b)   Considering possible targets for a terrorist act or acts, such as individual members of the New South Wales Police Force or the Australian Federal Police, and the Australian Federal Police headquarters building;

c)   Sourcing, obtaining and retaining firearms and ammunition;

d)   Numerous telephone communications (by text message and by telephone conversations) about impending martyrdom, training for a domestic terrorist attack, planning a domestic terrorist attack and firearms and ammunition; and

e)   Meeting at the offender’s premises at 13 Berry St Regents Park during the evening and early morning of 17 and 18 December 2014 for the purpose of considering documents the conspirators had made in preparation for a terrorist act.

14.   Some of the code words used by the conspirators, including the offender, were as follows:

a)   Banana      =   Firearms

b)   Motorbikes      =   Firearms

c)   Party         =   Meeting/terrorist attack

d)   Wedding date      =   Date of (terrorist) attack

e)   China         =   Overseas, fighting with ISIS

f)   Wombat      =   Khalid’s residence

g)   Over Pools      =   Overseas

h)   Tony         =   Ghazzawy

As well as being used during the conspirators’ and others’ coded conversations, some of these words were located on terrorist planning documents found at the offender’s home on 18 December 2014 (which are described in detail below).

15.   The content of the planning documents, together with Jibryl Almaouie’s possession of firearms and ammunition and “IM”’s sourcing of four firearms (each of which is addressed in further detail below), confirm that the terrorist act or acts in respect to which the conspirators engaged in acts of preparation and planning was an act or were acts of terrorism by using firearms to kill those targeted by the act or acts. The conspirators’ intention was that the terrorist act or acts would intimidate the Australian Federal Government and State governments, or the public.

C.   Roles of conspirators

(i)   The offender

16.   The offender was the leader of the group. He was a self-appointed preacher and used the name “Abu Bakr”. He gave advice, including religious advice, to other conspirators over the period of the conspiracy. He expressed strong views about the correctness of extremist ideology in a number of intercepted conversations. He also organised meetings at his premises that were attended by other members of the group.

17.   The offender, who was 20 years old at the time of the conspiracy (having turned 20 on 11 November 2014, four days into the conspiracy period) and is now 22 years old, had a large number of intercepted telephone communications with the much younger “IM”, who was 14 years old at the time of the conspiracy.

18.   The offender’s telephone communications with “IM” indicate that the offender and “IM” had a strong desire to engage in a terrorist act, including an act of martyrdom. In a number of telephone communications between him and “IM”, the offender urged “IM” not to go to Syria but to stay and pursue a terrorist act in Australia instead.

19.   The offender was careful to use code words and at various times made it clear in intercepted conversations that he would not speak about certain matters on the phone, believed his phone calls to be under surveillance and that he was under physical surveillance by police.

20.   The offender called members to attend at his premises and issued instructions to group members. He also retained the planning documents at his premises.

(ii)   “IM”

21.   “IM” was born on 12 September 2000 and is now 17 years old. At the commencement of the conspiracy, he was 14 years 11 weeks old. “IM” had a high level in the group.

22.   “IM” was a strong adherent of the jihadi ideology and had a significant amount of extremist material on his telephone. He often expressed a strong desire to engage in a terrorist act and expressed an urgent desire for martyrdom. A number of the conversations he had with the offender involved the offender urging “IM” not to go to Syria but to stay and pursue a terrorist act here in Australia.

23.   “IM” was involved in a significant number of intercepted SMS and telephone conversations with the offender. In addition to those communications described above, “IM” also asked when a terrorist act or acts would be committed here in Australia in his telephone communications with the offender. “IM” often spoke about the desire for weapons, in respect of which he and the offender used code words such as “bananas”, and he said that if he was not able to train for any terrorist act he would not take part. “IM” also spoke to the offender in code about places and events.

24.   As part of “IM”’s role in the conspiracy, he sourced four firearms at his uncle’s house and sent photographs of himself posing with the firearms to the offender. [35]  “IM” sourced these firearms so the group had information on another possible source of firearms, by taking them without the uncle’s knowledge or consent. “IM” located the firearms and ascertained the nature of each, and confirmed his uncle’s possession of them to the offender.

(iii)   Jibryl Almaouie

25.   Jibryl Almaouie was born on 9 October 1993 and is now 23 years old. At the commencement of the conspiracy, he was 21 years old, having turned 21 on 9 October 2014.

26.   Jibryl was involved in intercepted telephone conversations with the offender. He was an adherent of the violent jihadi ideology. He had coded telephone conversations with the offender about firearms, ammunition and martyrdom.

27.   Jibryl was high up in the group. He was in possession of three functional firearms, ammunition including 12 gauge shotgun shells, jihadi documents, an SAS survival guide and a black flag with Arabic writing when his premises were searched by police on 18 December 2014. The firearms were a bolt action rifle with a loaded magazine attached, a double barrel shotgun and a shortened “over and under” shotgun. [36] 

28.   Jibryl was the author of the “torn up motorbike” document and the “We will break the ice here in Aus” document (which are addressed in further detail below). The first of those two documents contains images and descriptions of three firearms referred to as “motorbikes”, which confirms previous coded references to “motorbikes” during conversations to which Jibryl was a party. The second of those documents talks about the Sydney Siege in the CBD (the Lindt Cafe Siege) and says “the earlier we do things the better” and “The time is NOW!!!”

(iv)   Ibrahim Ghazzawy

29.   Ibrahim Ghazzawy was born on 13 October 1995 and is now 21 years old. At the time of the conspiracy, he was 19 years old, having turned 19 on 13 October 2014 [37] .

30.   Ghazzawy was an adherent of the violent jihadi ideology. He attended meetings with the other members of the group in furtherance of the conspiracy, and had a mid-level role in the group.

31.   Three of the six handwritten documents found in the offender’s home (each of which is addressed further below) contain Ghazzawy’s handwriting. Those documents demonstrate an active and real consideration of the type of terrorist act contemplated and its target. The documents were handed to others apart from Ghazzawy, and were read, discussed and added to as the discussion continued.

32.   On the “AFP Building” document, Ghazzawy wrote “If we are gna do the istishadi [Arabic for “martyrdom”, “death of a martyr” or “heroic death”] the AFP building is a good target, its in parra or the city.” On the “Gorilla Warfare” document, Ghazzawy wrote “The plan is gorilla [sic] warfare ... we are going to go to the woods and attack the dogs there, Blue Mountains and the surrounding forests.” On the “Lithgow Jail” document, Ghazzawy’s writing included the following: “Im gna speak to the group of 5 and tell them to immobilize as soon as we do our attack or even before. So it will confuse the enemy, and insha Allah [Allah willing] more brothers will arise and do something as soon as it sparks.”

(v)   Mohamed Al Maouie

33.   Mohamed Al Maouie is Jibryl’s brother. He was born on 30 October 1995 and is now 21 years old. At the time of the conspiracy, he was 19 years old, having turned 19 on 30 October 2014.

34.   Mohamed was an adherent of the violent jihadi ideology. His telephone contained a significant amount of extremist material, and images of him firing a pistol at a pistol range. When he was questioned about this material, he said he downloaded the material to show people “How stupid it was over there”, but denied that he was a supporter.

35.   He attended meetings with the other members of the group in furtherance of the conspiracy, and had a mid-level role in the group.

36.   His handwriting was on one of the six documents found at the offender’s premises, the “Gorilla Warfare” document. His fingerprints were on three of the documents, namely the “Gorilla Warfare” document, the “We will break the ice here in Aus” document and the “Blue Mountains” document.

37.   In the “Gorilla Warfare” document, Mohamed wrote the following:

“*    Hijra [migration] out of NSW - 7

*   Abo land

*   Dawah [proselytizing or preaching of Islam] to Abos = Army

*   Army = Buildings, Fortresses, Plans etc

*   Start Slowly ( under cover )

*   Own world

*   Start small = HUGE”

(vi)   Farhad Said

38.   Farhad Said was born on 30 January 1992 and is now 25 years old. At the commencement of the conspiracy, he was 22 years old, having turned 22 on 30 January 1994.

39.   Said was an adherent of the violent jihadi ideology. His telephone contained a significant amount of extremist material. He attended meetings with the other members of the group in furtherance of the conspiracy, and had coded telephone conversations with the offender. He had a mid-level role in the group.

40.   Said’s handwriting was on two of the six documents found at the offender’s premises, the “AFP Building” document and the “Lithgow Jail” document. In the “AFP Building” document, Said’s writing included the following: “Helicopters and all that so we are going to fight till shahada anyway so we might as well do something major”. In the “Lithgow Jail” document Said’s writing included the following: “Why don’t we target like a big organisation eg: headquarters of police force, ASIO etc but something massive ... If we are want to go all out them istishhad goes in then the rest go in to finish things off”.

THE DOCUMENTS

A.   Overview - documents’ purpose and circumstances of creation

41.   The offender agreed to and in his many intercepted messages, encouraged, the preparation and planning of a terrorist act as manifested in the handwritten planning documents prepared by the other conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy. The documents were connected with the preparations for a terrorist act or acts both on their face, and in the circumstances of their creation. The documents record a form of discussion and they were read, discussed and added to as the discussion continued. The forensic evidence shows that the documents were handed to others, apart from the author. In some cases, writing was added to the documents by someone other than the original author. The documents demonstrate an active and real consideration of the type of terrorist act contemplated, and its target. They outline different methods for the commission of one or more acts of terrorism and set out possible targets.

42.   The documents also demonstrate that the terrorist act or acts contemplated involved the use of firearms. They demonstrate that the type of acts being planned involved the killing of police - referred to disparagingly at times as “dogs” - and government officials. The documents demonstrate the religious inspiration for the act of terrorism contemplated, and reflect the violent jihadi ideology of the group (including by express references in the documents to jihad, religious obligation and the defence of Islam).

43.   In total, six handwritten planning documents were located at the offender’s premises at 13 Berry St Regents Park when a search warrant was executed on 18 December 2014. Most of them were found in the garage that the offender used as his bedroom, and one was torn and rolled up in the kitchen.

44.   The results of forensic examination of the documents are as follows:

a)   Document 1, Item I370, the “Torn Up Motorbike” document: Jibryl Almaouie wrote this document and his and the offender’s fingerprints have been identified on it;

b)   Document 2, Item I371c/d, “We Will Break the Ice Here in Aus” document: Jibryl Almaouie wrote this document and his fingerprints, together with those of the offender, “IM”, Mohamed Al Maouie and Said have been identified on it;

c)   Document 3, Item I372, the “AFP Building” document: this document was written by Ghazzawy and Said and the fingerprints of an unknown person have been identified on it;

d)   Document 4, Item I373: “Gorrilla Warfare” document: this document was written by Ghazzawy, Mohamed Al Maouie and an unknown person and the fingerprints of Mohamed Al Maouie and a third person have been identified on it;

e)   Document 5, Item I375, the “Lithgow Jail”  document: this document was written by Ghazzawy and Said and the fingerprints of an unknown person have been identified on it; and

f)   Document 6, Item I374, the “Blue Mountains” document: the author of this document has not been identified and the fingerprints of Mohamed Al Maouie have been identified on the document.

In summary, the offender handled Documents 1 and 2 but his writing was not identified on any of the documents.

B.   Contents of documents

(i)   DOCUMENT 1, Item I370: “The torn up Motorbike” document

45.   Item I370, the “torn up motorbike” document, contains images and descriptions of three firearms referred to as “motorbikes”. It confirms previous coded references to “motorbikes” during conversations between the offender and another person.

46.   The note was found on the kitchen floor of the offender’s home, ripped into four strips and rolled into a ball. It was torn up immediately before police entered the premises to execute the search warrant. It reads as follows:

“   About 350 litres of fuel for 3

(ii)   DOCUMENT 2, Item I371c/d: “We Will Break The Ice Here In Aus” document

48.   This document was located inside a backpack which was found in a garage adjoining the offender’s family home. The offender used this garage as his bedroom. Document examination has confirmed that this document was written by Jibryl Almaouie. It reads as follows:

Page 1

“1 – Security precautions is all wrong!!! 

A brother I wont name who, had ASIO following his family the next day after Georges River. We should know we are all on red hot flaming heat & we shouldn’t be in the public to start with

2 – Lower your voice in public because it just brings more heat & attention.

3 – We just saw what happened the next day, at the Sydney Siege in the CBD which means they will be on us 24/7 & I told you the earlier we do things the better. What are we waiting for the enemies to collect more info & we all cop it sideways. An example is salat [38]  is a fard [39]  right, can we say have sabr akhi [40]  & wait till its time to pray & make tarbiyyah before praying, NO!!! Allah says about the prayer being delayed, woe to those who pray.

Which was because of them delaying the prayer. And we are delaying Jihad. Jihad is a fard ayn on every Muslim. No permission is needed just as no permission is needed to pray. Both are a fara “id. Weve been waiting for years, ARE WE STILL GOING TO WAIT!!! Enough is enough, these pigs ( Australians ) are fighting our brothers in Ash – Sham [41]  & here in Aus & yous still want want to wait. Read, An – Nisa [42]  : 84 [43]  & tell me what excuse do we have after this Read, An-Nisa; 75 [44]  as well & tell me. 

The time is NOW!!! We are down we even came earlier to Revesby because we want to humiliate these dogs, that’s how keen we were. 

- 4- Show us a visual recording or hardcore evidence that the Khalifah [45]  chose you to be the Amir Otherwise I will give the bay ah [46]  myself. Just as the brothers in prison did without an Amir.

-5 – We have no weapons that’s why we came to yous to get our hands on them so you cant tell us NO!!! NOT NOW!!! 

THEN WHEN ? After we get slaughtered one by one?

6- Im not a fool and I will

make sure how to give the bay ah and who

to give it too & the conditions

& so on. So I won’t give it blindly

7- We --- are going to do our own

things & we will break the ICE

here in AUS. Instead of being 

sitting headless ducks with no –

direction were (sic) to go or look.

And by that everything will start

Here which will make yous walk

your talk instead of talking your talk”

“If we are gna do the

istishadi [47]  the AFP building is

a good target, its in parra or

the city.

Like the brother said, they will

So All of us gorila warfare?

Yes, but I would prefer the birthday 

cake orries more but if not then 

I’ll go with what the rest of yous think

Im gna speak to the group of 

5 and tell them to immobilize 

as soon as we do our attack or 

even before. So it will confuse the 

enemy, and insha Allah more brothers 

will arise and do something as 

soon as it sparks.

Why are they going to immobilize

Why don’t we target like a 

big organisation eg: headquarters

of police force, ASIO etc but 

something massive that would

get them shocked and stuff up 

there organisation. If we are want 

to go all out them istishhad

“Blue Mountains

Bush

Buildings/protections”

57.   A reproduction of Item I374 is on the following page.



FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION

A.   Firearms in Jibryl Almaouie’s possession

58.   During the execution of the search warrant at Jibryl Almaouie’s residence on 18 December 2014, firearms (each of which was operational) and a large quantity of ammunition were located in his bedroom. These items were found amongst items identified as his and were seized:

a)   1 x bolt action rifle (modified .303) with magazine containing rounds attached;

b)   Ammunition;

c)   Two “12 gauge” shotgun shells;

d)   Bag containing 21 large calibre (sic) rounds;

e)   Two bags containing small calibre (sic) rounds;

f)   Black bag containing around 20 shotgun rounds;

g)   Wooden stock for a shotgun;

h)   Shotgun barrel and single round of ammunition;

i)   Five boxes of shotgun and other .22 gauge ammunition;

j)   6.5mm rifle ammunition; and

k)   Double barrel shotgun barrel.

Jibryl Almaouie’s DNA was found on the shotgun and shotgun stock. Photographs of the firearms and some of the ammunition found and seized during this search will be tendered on sentence.

B.   Firearms sourced by “IM”

59.   At about 8.00pm on 6 December 2014, “IM” went to his uncle’s house with the intention of ascertaining what firearms were there. “IM” took possession of these firearms for the purpose of posing for photographs and sending these to the offender to check how they were housed and to generally assess if those firearms might be seized and used by the group. Over the next couple of hours he posed for photographs in various positions with three of the firearms, which he sent to the offender.  

60.   The firearms sourced by “IM” at his uncle’s house were:

a)   A Marlin 336 Rifle;

b)   An under over double barrel shotgun;

c)   A Carl Gustaf 96 Rifle; and

d)   A Thompson Centre Rifle.

Copies of photographs found on “IM”’s phone showing him posing with these firearms, including those sent to the offender, will be tendered on sentence.

61.   “IM” was later charged and pleaded guilty to possession of firearms.

INTERCEPTED TELEPHONE COMMUNICATIONS

62.   The offender’s telecommunications service was lawfully intercepted from 7 November 2014 to 24 December 2014. Monitoring of this service confirmed that the offender was in regular contact with the other conspirators. At the time, the services used by each were:   a)   The offender: 0405215760 - subscribed in the name of Suleiman HALID;

b)   “IM”: 0420404974 - subscribed in the name of Adam STEVENS;

c)   J. Almaouie: 0421937701 - subscribed in the name of Lady Nho TRAI;

d)   M. Almaouie: 0428815371 - subscribed in the name of Mr Abdallah ALMAOUIE;

e)   Ghazzawy: 0420298595 - subscribed in the name of Ms Amira GHAZZAWY;

f)   F. Said: 0404222303 - subscribed in the name of Farhad SAID; and

g)   F. Said: 0434914040 - subscribed in the name of Fred JOHNSON.

63.   With the exception of one of Said’s services and that of Ghazzawy and Mohamed Al Maouie, these names were intentionally false. Whilst recognising that in some cases the service was in a parent’s name, the use of obviously false names is relied upon by the Crown as supporting the existence of the conspiracy, the purpose of subscribing in a false name being to make it more difficult to track or identify the subscriber if the call was overheard.

64.   The offender and “IM” had a large number of telephone communications. In many of these intercepted communications, code words were used. The offender and “IM” knew that their activities had to be kept secret from the authorities, and attempted to cloak the true meaning of their conversations.

65.   A significant amount of the contact between the conspirators occurred by telephone, either by text messages or telephone conversations. The majority of the hundreds of telephone communications during the conspiracy period were between the offender and “IM”. Accordingly, the transcripts of each of the intercepted communications will be tendered on sentence.

66.   The key topics of discussion between the offender and “IM” were the desire to die, in particular to die as martyrs together, “IM”’s questions about whether it was better to do a terrorist act here in Australia or to go overseas - apparently to Syria - and to engage in fighting there (to which the offender responded it was better to do so here, and that they would do so) and coded discussions about firearms and ammunition.

67.   Examples of telephone communications between the offender and “IM” follow.

68.   On 7 November 2014, they had the following conversation:

“IM”:    “I’ll be with, I’ll be with the virgins of Paradise, with the permission of Allah, the Most High ASAP.”

...

OFFENDER:    “... (Singing) O Garden (of Paradise), O Garden (of Paradise), O Garden (of Paradise), I swear by Allah I cannot wait ...”

“IM”:    “I swear by Allah I cannot wait.”

OFFENDER:   “Come on our boys, come on our beloved. Come on, come on, come on, (sounds). Let’s do... Allah willing, Isaac, you’ll be running to the Garden (of Paradise). (Indistinct conversation in the distance - males) O Garden (of Paradise). O Garden (of Paradise). O Garden (of Paradise), I swear by Allah I cannot wait. Come on, Abdul Malik, let us run to the Garden (of Paradise).”

“IM”:   “Run to mart ... martyrs”

69.   At 5:54pm on 9 November 2014, “IM” sent the offender an SMS message saying “But allhamdulilah [51]  it is 9 brothers including me”.

70.   On 10 November 2014, “IM” called the offender. During their conversation “IM” told the offender that he had sought his father’s permission to travel overseas to fight, however, his father refused. “IM” discussed martyrdom and wanting to go to “Jannah.” [52] 

71.   From 2:16pm on 10 November 2014, “IM” and the offender had the following conversation by way of SMS messages:

“IM”:    “Allhamdulilah!!!!  So we have 9 Shabab [53]  try to get more?” 

OFFENDER:    “Can’t see you today 9 shabab meaning 9 chefs cause in shall ah [54]  were going to be cooking lots of nice food”

OFFENDER:    “We have a big kitchen as well”

“IM”:   “And do we have lots of supplies and you heard me if I don’t go cooking training I’m not coming”

OFFENDER:   “We’re gonna try to get in the master chefs competition”

“IM”:   “Look Abu [55]  are we gonna train”

OFFENDER:   “It depends what the master chefs conditions are cause there a lot of mad chefs out there that know how to cook pasta then u got chicken lam sheep all kinds of nice tender foods”

OFFENDER:   “I love my stomach and you know every chef has to love his stomach”

“IM”:   “Yeah if there is a lot of good cooks I don’t care about if there good I want to train so I can be good if I don’t train with the materials we need I’m not coming.

72.   At 8:44am on 11 November 2014, the offender and “IM” had the following conversation by way of SMS messages:

OFFENDER:   “(IM) guess what today I turned 20 years old”

“IM”:   “Praise be to Allah brother I’d say happy birthday but it’s religiously forbidden so happy 20th”

OFFENDER:   “Thanks my beloved just know that we are getting closer to death everyday.” 

73.   During a telephone call at 7.12pm on 14 November 2014, the offender and “IM” had the following conversation:

“IM”:    “About over pools and stuff.”

OFFENDER:    “Pools?”

“IM”:   “Yeah, over pools.”

OFFENDER:   “What’s pools?”

“IM”:   “Your area.”

OFFENDER:   “My area?”

“IM”:   “Where you from?”

OFFENDER:   “Like yeah, man, what are you - what are you talkin’ about?”

“IM”:   “Brother, the State of Islam has been established.” ... “Yeah, I’ll tell him it’s - is like what he recommend, there or here, like” ...“No, not about - not about here. There, ask him what he recommends. No, yes.” ... “Bananas over there. Not over here.” ... “I want to ask him. I want to ask him, what do you recommend about me bananas there.”

The reference to “over pools” was a reference to overseas, and the reference to “bananas” was a reference to firearms.

74.   A few minutes later, at 7.17pm on 14 November 2014, “IM” again called the offender. “IM” said “I’m goin’ to ask him if he recommend that I do banana there or here”.

75.   In a further telephone conversation between the offender and “IM” at 11.58am on 29 November 2014, there was the following discussion of a “party”:

“IM”:   “The brother that you’re gunna meet, are we getting to the party - him? Like, you know what I mean?”

OFFENDER:   “Yeah, he’s gunna have a party, yeah.”

“IM”:   “With us?”

OFFENDER:   “Yeah. Do you want me to send the greetings to him?”

“IM”:   “Yeah. Have I ever met him?”

OFFENDER:   “No.”

“IM”:   “Can I know his name?”

OFFENDER:   “Abu ZAKARIA.” [Wassim FAYAD]

...

“IM”:   “How old’s his son?”

OFFENDER:   “He’s old enough.”

“IM”:   “Like?”

OFFENDER:   “I don’t know, probably twenty, twenty-one.”

76.   At 10:47pm on 2 December 2014, the offender and “IM” had a

conversation by way of SMS messages:

OFFENDER:    “(IM) don’t leave my side please”

“IM”:    “What the hell? Why am I going to leave your side why you talking like this stop”

OFFENDER:    “Sometimes I think to myself if I die now what’s going to happen to that someone that is dear to me”

77.   At 7:48pm on 3 December 2014, “IM” and the offender had the following conversation by way of SMS messages:

“IM”:   Tomatoes and bananas is our patience brother in al islam make supplication” [56] 

The offender later sent the following SMS messages to “IM”:

OFFENDER:    My love I ask Allah to allow us to leave this world together together together me and you this is what I wish for this is what I want and this is what I ask Allah everyday for to leave to depart from this world with my little brother with my love as I’m writing this to you I’m crying (IM) I want you to stick by me stand with me together we will leave this life”

OFFENDER:   “I don’t want to leave this life by myself I don’t want to”

OFFENDER:   “I will make supplication for you my young little brother I swear I’m here for you all I ask Allah Glorified and Exalted is He to allow me and you to leave to the Garden (of Paradise) together ...”

78.   On 5 December 2014, “IM” sent a text message to the offender as follows: “Glory be to Allah I had a dream that we did bananas here”.

79.   On 6 December 2014, “IM” sent a text message to the offender as follows: “Do you know how my dad got he’s bananas licences anyway me and him are going to check some bananas out at hes brothers cause he’s has some.” (“IM”’s father was the holder of a firearms licence.) At the time “IM”’s uncle was also the licensed owner of the four firearms that are described above.

80.   During the evening of 6 December 2014, “IM” sent the offender a text message as follows: “Like what time ,,, do you want me to send you a pic of me holding the banana”. The offender replied: “No show me the banana tomoz so I can eat it as well”.

81.   At 3.06pm on 8 December 2014, the offender and “IM” had a half an hour conversation during which they continually referred to the word “banana”. For example:

“IM”:   “How long do you reckon, um, we’re gonna get the - the bananas in because I’ve ordered the green ones, they’re too small but.”

OFFENDER:    “I don’t like green bananas.”

“IM”:    “Yeah, how long you reckon the full bananas will come in?”

OFFENDER:    “Don’t forget there’s oranges and there’s, um...”

“IM”:   “Um, throwers. I call the oranges throwers, yeah?”

OFFENDER:   “No, no, no, fruits.”

“IM”:   “Everything? ... Have you been told what bananas and fruits ...(indistinct)...?”

OFFENDER:   “Yeah ...(indistinct...) they’re bananas. Anyway look - - -”

...

“IM”:   “Listen to me. Do you know when we’re goin’ to get the bananas? ... Did you call about it yet? ... Did you call about it yet because I’m dying in temptation, bro? I’m dying.”

Later in the conversation “IM” said: “I’m thinking of takin’ my phone away ... I’m thinkin’ of chuckin’ my phone, bro”. The conversation continued:

OFFENDER:   “What the heck, man? ... Would you eat a - would - would you eat a banana with me?”

...

“IM”:   “I’m bein’ serious. I don’t want ..(indistinct)...”

OFFENDER:   “Ah no, I’m - I’m serious. An actual banana. Would you eat an actual banana with me?”

“IM”:   “Yeah.”

82.   On 10 December 2014, “IM” sent the offender an SMS that included the words: “I think Allah willing I am going to get the Garden of Paradise through that banana. God is great, no god but Allah is the Most Great there is no god but Allah O Abu Bakr”. The offender responded “Praise be to Allah are you going to stand and stay beside me ?” and “IM” replied “Allah willing yes.”

83.   At 10.41pm on 15 December 2014, Osman and the offender had a coded conversation about firearms. The offender said “I mean once we give the marriage contract then - then, um, then we’ll be able to get our hands on those motorbikes”. Osman said “I’m not really sure what you’re talking about exactly, brother, but I tell you what I do, tomorrow I’m gunna come see my brother, ah, my brother’s step kid”. Osman later said “I’ll go through everything in detail with you if I’m - I’m a hundred per cent what we’re talking about tomorrow, Allah willing”. When the term “motorbikes” is used out of context, as it was here, it had a coded meaning of “firearm” (as it did in the “Torn Up Motorbike” document found in the offender’s kitchen on 18 December 2014.)

84.   At 10.45pm on 15 December 2014, “IM” asked the offender what was up. The offender said “you told him - you told him about the --the marriage contract and the motorbikes”. The offender asked what made “IM” tell him about this. “IM” said that he would tell the offender tomorrow when he saw him. “IM” said he and “Tony” (that is, Ghazzawy) “are thinking of going to Bankstown and crossing the roads”. The offender asked what is in Bankstown. “IM” was not going to tell the offender. The offender asked if “IM” was going to buy some clothes in Bankstown. “IM” said that they were going to cross the roads, “[t]hen go a different area, like I mean not Bankstown. Different area you understand?”.

85.   At 2:47pm on 16 December 2014, the offender and Jibryl Almaouie had a conversation relating to firearms. This conversation referred to the Lindt café siege. Immediately after this they spoke in Arabic and Jibryl said “I need to get married bro, straight out”. The offender replied, “we need to all get married”. Later in the conversation the offender said: “Bro, I looked at the flamin’ - the flippin’, um, what’s it called, the contract you gave me yesterday.” Jibryl laughed and said, “Straight flame, bro”. This coded conversation relates to the firearms found at Jibryl’s home on 18 December 2014 (which are referred to above).

86.   At 2:53pm on 16 December 2014, the offender and Jibryl had a further conversation during which they used code, and referred to food in place of ammunition; for example: cake, apricots, marshmallows, apples, grapes, strawberries, sponges, and other terms.

87.   At 2:17pm on 17 December 2014, the offender and “IM” had a telephone conversation. In this call “IM” was becoming impatient and wanted to know when the terrorist attack would happen. He asked the offender “Tell me now, good news or bad?”. The offender stated that he would tell “IM” after, when he saw “IM”. The offender said “Now don’t give me a headache!”. The offender said that the news is “Um, ah, in the middle”. “IM” asked “So does it mean we’re taking a step or we’re not gonna take a step? ”. The offender said that it was not about that. “IM” asked if “he” changed the “wedding date”, and the offender said that “it is but it’s not. It’s nothing about the day or anything”, and that he needed to speak to “IM” and ask him a question. “IM” guessed it was about “John”. The offender said that it was not about John. “IM” guessed that John wanted in on the “marriage”, “Like my supplication has been answered and everything, man, glory be to Allah”.

MEETINGS OF THE CONSPIRATORS AND OTHERS

88.   On 2 November 2014, the offenders and three others visited a prisoner called Wisam Fayad at Goulburn jail. During the visit, in response to a question from one of the men “Is Paradise real or not”, the offender answered “100%”. He later said “I’m the only one with balls”.

89.   After that jail visit, the conspiracy commenced. The offender was responsible for arranging meetings of the conspirators and others, and encouraged them to meet at his premises at 13 Berry St Regents Park. They also met at other places such as parks, and from time to time to pray.

90.   The offender increased the frequency of meetings with the conspirators and others from 29 November 2014 until the execution of a number of search warrants on 18 December 2014 (further details of which are set out below). The offender and the others used coded language to arrange the meetings, for example referring to the offender’s premises as the “wombat hole”. The conspirators and met regularly at the offender’s house in Regents Park during the first part of December 2014 and leading up to 18 December 2014.

91.   Surveillance and telephone intercept material confirms that a number of the group, including the offender, Jibryl Almaouie, Mohamed Al Maouie and unidentified others, attended 13 Berry Street Regents Park on the evening of 17 December 2014 and the early morning of 18 December 2014. Jibryl had been under observation by police from earlier on 17 December 2014 and was seen to drive his vehicle ALK-45X into the city. A short time later the vehicle was seen to leave and travel to where it was parked and unattended in the vicinity of 13 Berry Street Regents Park from 10.45pm on 17 December 2014 until 1.55am on 18 December 2014, when a male was seen to enter the vehicle and travel to Jibryl Almaouie’s residence at 73C Clarence Street Condell Park, where the vehicle was left parked. At 11.40am on 18 December 2014, the offender was seen to leave his residence, enter his vehicle and drive away.

ARREST AND CHARGING

92.   On 10 December 2015, the offender, “IM”, Jibryl Almaouie and Ghazzawy were arrested and charged. Mohamed Al Maouie was arrested on 23 December 2015. Farhad Said was arrested on 26 May 2016. Each was provided with their legal rights under Part 1C of the Crimes Act 1914 and declined to participate in a record of interview.

93.   The offender has been in custody since 23 December 2014 for this offending.

Khalid’s criminal history


	
	Khalid’s criminal history records a finding of guilt in the Local Court in September 2015 for a charge of stalk/intimidate in respect of which he was given the benefit of a bond under s. 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) for a period of 12 months [58] . There are no other entries.
	


The evidence of Mr Piazza


	
	The affidavit of Mr Piazza [59]  deals with a number of matters which are generally common to all offenders (with the exception of IM, in whose case affidavits from other persons [60]  were tendered which go, broadly speaking, to the same issues).
	
	
	Khalid is held in the High Risk Management Correctional Centre (“HRMCC”) at Goulburn which houses offenders who have been determined to represent a significant risk to the security of both the centre and the wider community, and who therefore require a higher level of supervision than the general prison population [61] . Khalid is currently classified as an AA Extreme High Risk Restricted Inmate [62] . He is permitted legal visits between Wednesday and Sunday of each week. All such visits are “non-contact” [63] , and correctional staff are positioned in the general vicinity of where the visit takes place [64] . A person may only visit an offender of Khalid’s classification if he or she has been approved by the Commissioner. Since being taken into custody Khalid has had a number of visits with relatives. Those too are “non-contact” visits. He currently has five approved personal visitors and one approved psychologist/psychiatrist. He has also had the telephone numbers of various family members approved to allow him to have conversations with them [65] .
	
	
	Khalid has reached Stage 2 of what Mr Piazza described as his “behaviour management level”. As he progresses through further levels, his privileges will be greater, particularly in terms of access to funds and amenities. The amenities to which he currently has access include basketball courts, running tracks and exercise yards. His ongoing access to those (and other) facilities will be dependent upon the particular behavioural level at which he is assessed at a given time [66] .
	
	
	It is open to Khalid to access all medical and mental health services offered at HRMCC, irrespective of his classification and designation [67] . The Proactive Integrated Support Model (“PRISM”) has been established to support the rehabilitation of offenders who have expressed certain religious or political views, or who have previously acted in a way that may be considered radical or extreme. The program is managed by a multidisciplinary team which includes a psychologist and a religious co-ordinator. When an offender engages with the program he is required to undergo an assessment of his psychological and social needs, following which a plan is developed to assist him in improving his life. Thus far, Khalid has made no application to enrol in the program [68] . Mr Piazza stated that there is presently no information to suggest that Khalid has renounced any extremist ideology [69] .
	
	
	Annexed to Mr Piazza’s affidavit were a number of case notes to which I was taken in the course of submissions. A case note of 15 June 2016 prepared by Mohammad Al Halabi made reference to concerns being expressed about Khalid “screeming (sic) in the middle of the night and saying strange things”. Mr Halabi noted that Khalid appeared to be “hostile and very disturbing” and he said that Khalid had indicated to him that he would like to learn more about “Islamic jurisprudence”, something Mr Halabi thought was a positive sign [70] . A further case note of 13 July 2016 prepared by James Poulos made further reference to Khalid’s “keen interest in Islamic juresprudence (sic)” which had apparently given rise to his being monitored on account of what were considered to be his extremist views [71] . The note also made reference to the fact that Khalid had been informed that concerns had been raised by a number of persons with whom he interacted about his “unsettling comments and behaviour” [72] .
	
	
	A further case note of 3 August 2016 prepared by Vicki Walcott [73]  made reference to Khalid expressing an interest in receiving a visit from a Rabbi because he “wanted to learn as much as possible about all things”. A further case note prepared by Ms Walcott on 7 September 2016 made reference to Khalid being visited by the Imam, who reported that Khalid had told him that he (Khalid) was “under pressure by a belief he had a demon in his body directing him to think and act in a manner not comfortable to (him)”, and that he was under “pressure to manage the unwelcome thoughts/voices in his head” [74] . The Imam expressed the view that such a presentation, if left untreated, was capable of leading to “serious mental health or self-harm behaviour”. It was noted that there was a plan to refer Khalid for mental health assessment. The evidence before me is silent on what (if anything) eventuated in that respect.
	
	
	Having been taken to those case notes, I drew the attention of senior counsel for Khalid to the conclusion expressed by Dr Nielssen (whose report was tendered and relied upon in Khalid’s case), namely that Khalid was not thought to require any specific psychiatric care or counselling. In response, it was submitted that Khalid had deliberately chosen not to give a complete history to Dr Nielssen because he did not want anyone to know of his condition [75] .
	
	
	Mr Piazza was called to give oral evidence in the sentence proceedings of Mohamed. Whilst some of his evidence touched specifically upon the circumstances of Mohamed’s incarceration, other parts of it were of a more general nature, and applied to the conditions of custody of each of the offenders (again, with the exception of IM). Strictly speaking, Mr Piazza’s oral evidence does not form part of the evidence in the proceedings of any offender other than Mohamed but in the circumstances, and to the extent that it applies generally, I have taken it into account in the cases of each of Khalid, Jibryl, Mohamed and Said.
	
	
	Mr Piazza explained that Mohamed (and by inference, Khalid, Jibryl and Said) were each housed in a cell measuring approximately 2m x 3m, which had no fresh air and limited exposure to natural light [76] . He said that access to sporting areas is limited to 1 hour at any one time, and must be booked in advance [77] . Mr Piazza explained that the behavioural level reached by an offender will determine the extent of access to personal telephone calls, which must in any event be conducted in English and which are limited to 6 minutes in duration [78] . Family visits are limited to one per week, are “non-contact” (such that the inmate is physically separated from the visitor) and must also be conducted in English [79] . Mr Piazza explained that the PRISM program is available to sentenced offenders, although he said that “technically” this was not so until the final 12 to 18 months of an offender’s sentence [80] .
	
	
	A list of “lock-ins” [81]  was tendered in Khalid’s case setting out occasions on which he had been detained in his cell for periods of up to a full day. Mr Piazza accepted that the list was generally accurate [82] . He also accepted that the frequency of complete lock-ins (i.e. where inmates are detained in their cells for a full day) had increased to up to two times each week. He confirmed that one of the consequences of a lock-in is that all legal visits are cancelled [83] .
	


The “Insight” Program


	
	On 12 August 2014 Khalid was a member of the audience at a taping of an episode of a program called “Insight”. He was accompanied on that occasion by his solicitor, Ms Burrows. The episode was entitled “Joining the Fight”, and involved a discussion between the compere, Ms Jenny Brockie, and those present regarding the conflicts in Iraq and Syria, and the involvement of Australians in those conflicts. Khalid appeared on the program dressed in a shirt bearing what Ms Brockie described as “the ISIS flag” on the left sleeve. He was addressed by Ms Brockie as “Abu Bakr”.
	
	
	Before considering what was said by Khalid on that occasion, I should note that senior counsel for Khalid submitted that the circumstances surrounding Khalid’s appearance on the program were unfair because “he had been invited to speak about the fact that his passport had been taken off him [84] , and “in the course of him being there they then asked him about his support for ISIS” [85] . As I understood it, the effect of what was put was that any statements made by Khalid on that occasion should be assessed in that light, and should be afforded limited weight. No evidence was adduced in Khalid’s case about any of the matters to which senior counsel referred. The Crown made it clear that it relied on this footage, not as evidence establishing that Khalid appeared on the program to promote ISIS, but as part of the evidence which established his ideology at the time of the offending [86] .
	
	
	I have approached and assessed this evidence bearing in mind the purpose for which the Crown relied on it. However I should also make it clear that I am unable to accept the submission that anything said by Khalid on that occasion was said in the context of any underlying unfairness. Leaving aside the absence of evidence to support such a submission, the simple fact is that Khalid was accompanied by his solicitor at the time. Moreover, the footage demonstrates his solicitor periodically intervening, and advising Khalid not to make particular statements, or answer particular questions. One some occasions that advice was heeded by Khalid, and on other occasions it was ignored. It is, to say the least, difficult in those circumstances to make good a submission that statements made by Khalid in the course of the program were somehow tainted by unfairness.
	
	
	One extract from the footage of the Insight program appears in the statement of facts [87] . However there are other parts of the footage which are also relevant. For example, at an early stage of the program, the following exchange took place between Ms Brockie and Khalid [88] :
	


BROCKIE:

Okay. Abu BAKR, you're nineteen. You were born here. You grew up in Sydney. What do you think about Australians going over to fight with ISIS and I see you're wearing the ISIS flag on your shirt?

BAKR:

It doesn't really come down to what sort of flag 'cause this flag - this - this flag here, yeah, is, you know, it's - it's - people might say, oh, you're a supporter of Jabhat ai-Nusra and this flag here that you - people might say you're a supporter of ...(indistinct)... Islam and ISIS, you know, but these flags are all one. They're all - they're - they're all the same flags. One Muslim nation and that's it.

BROCKIE:

Okay. Tell me about that connection that you feel to Iraq and to what's going on in Iraq and Syria and the connection to that flag. Where does that connection come from in you?

BAKR:

Well, firstly, it comes from me being a Muslim, me standing up for my faith and an - and - and, you know, it's – it’s mentioned in the Koran in numerous spots in the Koran where the Muslims - the Muslims - it is an obligation upon them to go and help the needy.

BROCKIE:

Is that an obligation to fight as well?

BAKR:

This is - this is a personal choice of anyone - whoever wants to go and fight they - they - they - they go for. This is a personal choice and this is up to anyone that wants to go or doesn't wanna go.

BROCKIE:

M'hm. You were born in Australia.

BAKR:

Yeah.

BROCKIE:

How connected do you feel to the values here in Australia?

BAKR:

Well, the Australian Government, you know, in order for me to be connected to the values here of Australia the Australian Government needs to stop picking on the Muslims here and they need to stop picking on, for example, you know, the - the - the - the sisters wearing a burqa, for example, or - or whenever you wanna voice your opinion on something and expose an oppression of a tyrant then you are subjugated to being a terrorist or, you know, you are being subjugated to being a national threat of a country.

BROCKIE:

Okay. Tell me what you think of ISIS. I'm interested in what you think of ISIS as an organisation.


	
	At that point, Ms Burrows, Khalid’s solicitor, intervened and said:
	


Okay. Don’t answer it


	
	The conversation proceeded:
	


BAKR:

Look, ISIS, they - they - they do not want to bring anything but justice, ISIS. They don't wanna bring anything but justice.

BROCKIE:

And what do you think justice is?

BAKR:

Justice is giving the - the - the giving the right of the people, giving the rights to the people, feeding the people, sheltering the people, clothing the people.

BROCKIE:

Okay.

BAKR:

This is what ISIS is trying to bring - justice, peace and humanitarian aid to the people.

The YouTube footage


	
	The Crown tendered YouTube footage consisting of 25 separate files on which Khalid appeared [89] , although File 12 was the only footage upon which the Crown relied. It was played in the course of the sentencing hearing. At the request of senior counsel for Khalid I have also had regard to a number of other files, which were not played in the hearing. It was senior counsel’s submission that those other files place, into a proper context, that upon which the Crown relied.
	
	
	File 25 contains footage entitled “A direct message to the Secret Services – a call to Tawheed” [90] . It depicts Khalid engaging in what might be described as a monologue which he specifically directed to law enforcement, and quasi law enforcement, agencies. Relevant extracts from that footage appear in the statement of facts [91] . I have viewed that footage on several occasions. As I have concluded below, the text of what Khalid said, and his demeanour, were both confronting and threatening. On some of the remaining files to which I was directed by senior counsel for Khalid, the content was more moderate, and Khalid’s demeanour less threatening. Those files contained, by way of example, statements to the following effect:
	



	
	“By all means defend yourself from non-Muslims if you are attacked physically, but if attacked using words, smile and do not swear … even Australian laws give you the right to defend yourself … do not support fights but stop them immediately … when a policeman approaches you and is respectful, showing them disrespect will put a stain on Islam” [92] ;
	
	
	“Muslims should deal with peaceful non-Muslims justly … I make it clear. I do not encourage radicalisation or extremism and I do not encourage any sort of violence and I do not encourage any sort of killing or rape. I do not encourage any of this. This is for the ‘secret people’. What I encourage is Muslims to wake up to themselves” [93] ; and
	
	
	“Islam is a religion of salvation and not terrorism, bombing, killing and raping” [94] .
	


THE EVIDENCE RELIED UPON BY KHALID

The oral evidence


	
	A number of witnesses were called to give oral evidence in Khalid’s case.
	
	
	Xiang Qing Jong Meng gave evidence that Khalid had been his neighbour from 2007 to 2013 [95] . He described Khalid as “polite, quiet and nice”  [96] . He said that Khalid helped his (i.e. Mr Meng’s) parents by wheeling their rubbish bin and that Khalid had offered to help him to wash his car  [97] . He said that “neighbour to neighbour” his relationship with Khalid and his family was “quite good” and that there had been no trouble from anyone in Khalid’s family [98] .
	
	
	Neil Mercer gave evidence that at the beginning of 2014, when he was a freelance journalist, he had been asked by the NSW Community Relations Commission to become involved in a project concerning young Australian men going to Syria. For that purpose Mr Mercer interviewed a number of people, including Khalid [99] . He spoke to Khalid a number of times between March 2014 and June 2014, including one occasion on which he interviewed him on camera [100] . He described Khalid as “young”, “perhaps angry” and “naïve” [101] . He said that he remembered thinking that Khalid was a “young man with a little bit of knowledge but not a lot” and that Khalid “certainly didn’t strike (him) as sophisticated” [102] .
	
	
	Abdul Raham Saleh gave evidence that he had known Khalid for about 6 years [103] . Whilst their association stemmed in part from Mr Saleh’s volunteer community work, Khalid had also worked for a period as a labourer in Mr Saleh’s plumbing business [104] . The community work in which Mr Saleh and Khalid had engaged involved the distribution of literature to members of the public in the conduct of what Mr Saleh described as an “Islamic awareness program” which was designed to “educate the general people about Islam, the moderate Islam” [105] . Khalid was involved in the distribution of that literature, a sample of which was tendered [106] . It is not necessary to summarise its contents. Its general nature can be ascertained from the titles, which include “Islam is not a religion of extremism” and “About Islam – a brief introduction”. Mr Saleh explained that Khalid had also assisted him in helping disadvantaged youth, the homeless and other persons who needed assistance [107] .
	
	
	When asked whether he had ever seen any violent tendencies in Khalid, Mr Saleh emphatically stated that he had not [108] . He also confirmed that between July and December 2014 he was a frequent visitor to Khalid’s home, and said that on none of the occasions on which he visited did Khalid ever speak about violence in terms of Islam [109] . In cross-examination, Mr Saleh told the Crown that in the period of time over which he knew him, Khalid had never spoken to him, at any time, about violent jihad [110] .
	
	
	Sueha Belani, a primary school teacher, gave evidence via audio-visual link from the United Kingdom. She said that she had known Khalid for a period of about 9 years and that before moving to England in 2012 she had been good friends with him for about 4 to 5 years [111] , although it is apparent that she has had limited contact with Khalid since about 2013 [112] . When asked her opinion of Khalid, Ms Belani said that he was a person for whom she had “so much admiration and respect” [113] , describing him as a “really, really lovely young man” who “wouldn’t hurt a fly” and a person in whom she had never observed any violent tendency [114] . She said that she understood the charge to which Khalid had pleaded guilty and was familiar with at least some of the underlying facts. When asked how those facts fitted with the person that she knew, Ms Belani responded that she “wholeheartedly disagree(d)” that Khalid’s commission of the offence was consistent with his personality in her experience of him [115] . In cross-examination, Ms Belani stated that she was “absolutely” shocked at the charge to which Khalid pleaded guilty [116] . She also said that at no stage had Khalid ever spoken to her about violent jihad [117] .
	
	
	Maryam Khalid, Khalid’s sister, also gave evidence. She described Khalid as being “the quiet one” in the family [118]  and said he was a person who had problems fitting in at school because of “trust issues” [119] . She said that as a youth Khalid was never violent, and never spoke in terms of aggression, hatred or confrontation with others [120] . She said that in 2014 her parents were essentially living separate lives and that this had been the situation, on and off, for many years [121] . She said that her parents’ separation had impacted adversely upon Khalid psychologically [122] . She described him as a person who was “passionate” about helping disadvantaged youth [123]  and who was “disappointed, upset, (and) confused” when his passport was cancelled in 2013 [124] . She said that he had never discussed the concept of violent Islam with her and that she had never seen any violent tendency in him [125] .
	
	
	Ahmad Thaher, Khalid’s cousin, also gave evidence. He described having had a close relationship growing up with Khalid [126] , but said that in more recent years they had had less contact [127] . Mr Thaher said that as a youth Khalid was a “sensitive boy…very soft, very gentle, warm hearted” [128] , and that these attributes led to Khalid being “a little naïve, a little vulnerable and gullible, and easily manipulated” [129] . He described Khalid as a person who was “always very helpful” to others, and who wanted to lead others along the right path to becoming a better person [130] . When asked whether he had ever known Khalid to express aggression, anger or violence towards others, Mr Thaher responded by saying that Khalid “wouldn’t hurt a fly” [131] . He described Khalid’s involvement in the conspiracy as “very surprising” because Khalid’s main purpose was to help people and not harm them [132] .
	
	
	Zaher El-Cheikh gave evidence that he met Khalid’s father in late 1990, and soon after met Khalid and the remaining members of his family [133] . He described Khalid as a “lovely boy” and “quiet” as a child [134] . He said that as a youth, Khalid was “polite” and “lovely to be around” although Mr El-Cheikh conceded that his primary relationship was with Khalid’s father [135] . Mr El-Cheikh said that he had seen the Insight program and that in a subsequent discussion he had advised Khalid that “this kind of debate should be left” [136] . He said that Khalid had never expressed violence in terms of his (i.e. Khalid’s) perception of Islam, nor had Khalid ever suggested embracing the concept of violent jihad [137] . He described Khalid as a person “who had a passion to call people to Islam” [138]  and expressed the view that Khalid had pleaded guilty “out of desperation” [139] .
	
	
	Finally, Mouminah Khalid, Khalid’s elder sister, gave evidence. She said that on a number of occasions on which she had visited Khalid in custody he had expressed disagreement with the underlying philosophies of ISIS [140] . In cross-examination, she said that Khalid had not previously supported ISIS but that she had understood from him that he thought that ISIS was “helping the people …” [141] .
	


The documentary evidence


	
	The report of Dr Nielssen [142]  followed two interviews with Khalid in custody on 25 August 2017 and 20 September 2017. In terms of the offending Dr Nielssen reported [143] :
	


When asked about the nature of the conspiracy, Mr Khalid said ""we were planning terrorist acts ... guerrilla warfare ... to attack a government building ... just something of this nature you know"". When asked if he had any specific plan, he said ""it was just a discussion ... but obviously my situation is a bit different to the others because they are alleging I am the leader... but I wasn't the leader... there was no leader to start with ... I was the leader of preaching the religion ... but not of terrorist acts"". He said ""there was no agreement with regards what they were going to do"".

…

When asked about access to means to commit terrorist acts, Mr Khalid said ""there was knowledge of firearms but there was no agreement they were going to be used ... I did not have any intention of using any weapons ... one of my co-accused did have two or three firearms ... but they were not going to be used in this alleged conspiracy"".

He said that the building that was discussed was the Australian Federal Police (AFP) building, but he said that he did not know which building or where the building was located, and said ""there was no specific one"". He said ""I would never allow any one (sic) to get hurt... I did not want anything like that to happen"".

Mr Khalid confirmed the discussion of code words to be used, as he said ""I knew a million percent I was under surveillance ... I have been under surveillance since I was sixteen"".

When asked about his role in the conspiracy, Mr Khalid said ""my part in this was I had a garage ... it was like an inside outside place I turned into a bedroom and used it as a sort of a youth centre drop in"". He said ""it was to talk to the talk ... to gain their trust ... to stop the boys from harming themselves and others ... exercising my experience with troubled youth ... I was just going with the flow with the boys ... I would inform Danny Mikati if something would happen.


	
	Dr Nielssen said that in the course of the second interview Khalid told him that if he “knew for certainty that an attack was going to take place (he) would inform Danny Mikati” [144]  (Mr Mikati was a member of the NSW Police with whom Khalid apparently had some social association). Dr Nielssen then recorded Khalid as saying [145] :
	


I fully understand my charge ... I deeply regret for being involved although it was not my intention for anyone to be harmed. …. I am going to work towards my rehab and help others towards the good and communicate peacefully with the authorities and understand one another's frustrations.


	
	In terms of Khalid’s background, Dr Nielssen recorded that he was the third of six children whose father had come to Australia from Iraq in 1987, whose mother had originated from Sicily, and whose older siblings had worked in a number of varied occupations. Khalid attended Auburn West Public School and Birrong Boys High School to the end of Year 10 but left school to start a TAFE course in landscaping from which he withdrew after a few months. He then worked as a removalist for 8 months, then in a convenience store in the city, and later with Mr Saleh. Khalid told Dr Nielssen that his family were “normal” and “followed the basics of Islam” [146] .
	
	
	In the course of a mental state examination, Dr Nielssen observed that Khalid did not appear to be especially anxious or depressed and that his concentration was unimpaired. He said that Khalid was a person of average intelligence [147] . Dr Nielssen expressed the view that Khalid did not meet the accepted criteria for the diagnosis of any kind of developmental disorder, acquired brain injury, psychotic illness, severe mood disorder or any other major psychiatric disorder, and that it seemed that Khalid had adjusted to his strict conditions of custody [148] . Dr Nielssen also reported that Khalid had maintained that he was against violence and that he would have intervened to prevent any acts of violence had there been a specific plan [149] . Dr Nielssen concluded by stating [150] :
	


Mr Khalid was very young when these offences took place, and it seems that some of his attitudes were influenced by the idealism associated with his young age, including some indignation at perceived discrimination and mistreatment of Muslims. He would be expected to mature in his attitudes over time, and hopefully become more concerned with his own career and the care of his own family as he grows older.

Mr Khalid was not thought to require any specific psychiatric care or counselling at this stage.


	
	The statement of Det. Victor set out the circumstances of Khalid’s arrest and search of his premises on 18 December 2014 [151] . Paragraph 23 recorded the following:
	


During the search warrant Sulayman Khalid and I had a number of conversations about why we were created and current events in the media. Sulayman Khalid said:

That guy was insane, he killed two innocent lives. The Quran says if you take one innocent life you take all of humanity. I was created to worship Allah.


	
	It is apparent that the incident to which Khalid was referring when making that statement was the siege at the Lindt Café in Sydney which had occurred only a matter of days before.
	
	
	The list of “lock-ins” [152]  records occasions on which Khalid has been detained in his cell for periods of between half a day and a day between September 2016 and August 2017.
	
	
	The list of references from the Qur’an was tendered following submissions regarding that part of the YouTube footage upon which the Crown relied [153] . I have dealt with those references further below.
	


THE NATURE AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF KHALID’S OFFENDING

Submissions on behalf of the Crown


	
	The Crown submitted that the factors set out at [23] and following above were relevant to assessing the objective seriousness of Khalid’s offending. The Crown also emphasised that the gravamen of a conspiracy is the agreement to participate in organised criminal activity, and submitted that the objective seriousness of Khalid’s offending was to be primarily assessed by reference to the criminality of the enterprise of which he, and the other conspirators, had agreed to be a part.
	
	
	The Crown acknowledged that the period of the conspiracy was a relevant factor. However, it was submitted that even if a conclusion were reached that such period was relatively short, the evidence nonetheless established that there had been a considerable degree of planning in that time. In this regard, the Crown pointed to the content of the documents retained by Khalid at his home, parts of which were expressed in heavily coded language. The Crown also emphasised that Khalid took steps to conceal his involvement in the conspiracy by using coded language in text messages and phone calls, and by using a telephone service which was operated in a name other than his own.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that Khalid’s offending was “not much less serious than the worst case situation”. It was submitted that Khalid, along with his co-conspirators, had a strong commitment to carry out an act or acts of terrorism as evidenced by the fact that specific acts, and specific targets, were discussed. The Crown further submitted that a matter of critical significance was the fact that the conspirators had acquired firearms and thus had available to them the means to carry out the acts which were being discussed. In this respect, the Crown pointed specifically to Jibryl’s possession of firearms and ammunition, and IM’s sourcing of further firearms for use by the group. It was submitted that this elevated the seriousness of the conspiracy to a significant extent.
	
	
	Finally, the Crown submitted that Khalid was the leader of the group and in that capacity had given advice to other conspirators, and had organised meetings at his premises. The Crown also pointed to Khalid’s urgings to IM that he not to go to Syria, but that he remain and commit terrorist acts in Australia instead. Equally, the Crown acknowledged that attempting to establish a hierarchy within the conspiracy, in circumstances where each of the conspirators was committed to a common cause and had played a significant role, was of limited assistance in determining the objective seriousness of the offending in each case.
	


Submissions of behalf of Khalid


	
	Mr van de Weil QC, on behalf of Khalid, submitted that the evidence did not establish a recognisable plan to commit any terrorist act. He submitted that much of the material relied upon by the Crown to prove the conspiracy had the appearance of being “naïve” and “fanciful”. In this regard, he drew particular attention to the “Blue Mountains” and “Gorilla Warfare” documents, although he did acknowledge that other material such as the “Lithgow Gaol” document was of greater concern.
	
	
	Senior counsel took specific issue with the Crown’s submission as to the level of objective seriousness of Khalid’s offending. He submitted that the conspiracy amounted to a discussion of a wide spectrum of ideas that fell substantially short of perfecting any plan. He further submitted that the conspiracy was properly regarded as unsophisticated, infantile and seriously undeveloped. He submitted that Khalid’s role was that of a person engaged in discussions with like-minded individuals in circumstances where he was “one … of equals”  [154] . He also emphasised that Khalid had access, through Mr Saleh’s business, to items such as gas bottles which could easily be converted to bombs, and that there was no suggestion that Khalid had, at any time, availed himself of such access.
	
	
	Senior counsel also took particular issue with the proposition that Khalid was properly regarded as the “leader” of the group. He submitted that the evidence established nothing more than the fact than Khalid was a religious advisor to others, and that merely providing a venue for gatherings did not establish that Khalid had any leadership role at all. He submitted that there was no evidence that Khalid had any knowledge of explosives, military tactics, training exercises, or the use of firearms, that he had no access to firearms, and that he was not the author of any of the documents that were found at his premises.
	
	
	It was further submitted that when viewed as a whole, Khalid’s appearances on the YouTube footage and the Insight program did not promote extremist ideology. It was submitted that this evidence amounted to nothing more than Khalid’s expression of his own religious views, and his exhortations to follow the Islamic faith. Senior counsel described Khalid as “not a very educated man” who “spouts a form a religion as he perceives it” [155] . He submitted, in particular, that many of the statements made on that part of the YouTube footage upon which the Crown relied were generally consistent with the teachings expressed in the Qur’an [156] . He further submitted that I should accept the evidence of the various witnesses called on Khalid’s behalf, and conclude that Khalid was a peace-loving and non-violent man, whose commission of this offence was properly regarded as an aberration.
	


Submissions on behalf of the Crown in reply


	
	The Crown emphasised that the offence to which Khalid had pleaded guilty was a conspiracy to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act. It was submitted that in circumstances where some of the documents in question pointed to the killing of police officers and martyrdom attacks on Government buildings, the fact that there was no evidence that Khalid had attempted to obtain possession of items such as gas bottles was of little or no significance.
	
	
	To the extent that it was submitted that the offending was unsophisticated, the Crown submitted that shooting people with firearms (which was, on the evidence, a part of what was being discussed) did not require a highly developed or highly analytical plan, and that all that was needed was firearms, accompanied by an ability and willingness to shoot people or property. Whilst the Crown accepted that there was no evidence that Khalid had any particular skill or training in the use of firearms, it was submitted that discharging a firearm was not difficult, and that somebody with little training could cause great harm if given access to one. It was submitted that the availability of firearms was of considerable concern, and served to increase Khalid’s objective criminality.
	
	
	The Crown accepted that the evidence fell short of establishing that any particular target had been selected as the site of an attack. However, the Crown emphasised that the conspiracy obviously involved discussions about possible targets, attacks on which would obviously involve the use of firearms, the destruction of property, and the possible killing of police officers.
	
	
	Finally, the Crown submitted that the majority (if not all) of those who gave oral evidence in Khalid’s case were obviously completely unaware of his level of adherence to, and the strength of his belief in, violent ideology. The Crown emphasised that almost all of them had given evidence that Khalid had not discussed that issue with them at any time. It was submitted that in light of the evidence, it was obvious that Khalid had kept his extreme views from each of those witnesses. It was submitted that the evidence as a whole did not support the conclusion that Khalid was a person of the peace loving character that each of the witnesses had described. Whilst the Crown accepted that it would be open to me to find that each of those witnesses had done their best to give honest and truthful evidence, it was submitted that it was clear that none of them knew of Khalid’s adherence to violent ideology, and that their various opinions of his character necessarily fell to be assessed in that light.
	


Consideration


	
	It is both artificial and contrary to the concept of a conspiracy to attempt to precisely dissect the physical acts of each of the conspirators, and to then sentence each of them for those acts alone. Such an approach amounts to a negation of the complex inter-connection between the various participants, and the organisational nature of a conspiracy. That is not to say that the physical acts of an offender whose sentence is under consideration are irrelevant. However, the fundamental act of any conspirator is that he agreed with the other conspirators, in this case to commit acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts. Whilst the identification of Khalid’s role (and the role of any other participant) may be relevant and important, the fact of the agreement, and its subject matter, are not to be put aside in favour of concentrating upon his physical acts. It follows that I am not confined to sentencing Khalid on the narrow basis of what he physically did [157] .
	
	
	The present conspiracy extended over a period of six weeks and that is obviously a relevant factor. In comparison with other cases of this kind, that period might be regarded as short. However, it was nevertheless a substantial period. Moreover, giving primacy to the length of the period of the conspiracy reflects a somewhat artificial approach to the assessment of the nature and circumstances of the offending. It is obviously necessary to consider a number of other factors, including what was actually done in that period.
	
	
	In the present case, what was done was both significant and wide ranging. Targets were discussed. The methods by which attacks on those targets might be perpetrated were also discussed. Parts of those discussions were reduced to writing in the course of which extremist views were expressed. Numerous firearms, along with a substantial quantity of ammunition, were acquired. It is also relevant that on the evidence before me, the conspiracy ended, not because the conspirators decided to desist, but because the authorities intervened and arrested them.
	
	
	Moreover, Khalid’s admitted act of being part of that criminal conspiracy was committed against a background of, and was inextricably linked to, an ideology which advocates violence towards people and property, and which extolls the virtues of martyrdom. Khalid’s fundamental adherence to that ideology is evident from, amongst other things, his plea of guilty. The depth of that adherence is informed by a number of other factors.
	
	
	For example, in his conversations with IM, Khalid repeatedly advocated acts of martyrdom. His statements that he “could not wait” to “reach the garden of Paradise”, and his expressions of a desire that he and IM be permitted to be martyrs together, are self-explanatory.
	
	
	The various statements made by Khalid on the Insight program many months before his offending are equally telling. They included an unequivocal threat to the Australian Government that “something’s gunna happen here” unless action were taken to remove Australian military forces from Iraq.
	
	
	Statements made by Khalid on the YouTube footage relied upon by the Crown are even more significant. The tone in which he delivered his “message”, and his general demeanour, were both confronting and threatening. He warned those who chose to reject Islamic teachings that they would “regret it”, and would have their faces “dragged through the pits of hell fire”. His statements also contained what was, in effect, a demand to reject what he described as the “chains and shackles of democracy” in favour of Sharia law, a direct attack on the democratic freedoms that Australian citizens are fortunate to enjoy. What he said cannot be explained, much less excused, on the basis that some of it is said to have been expressed in terms consistent with what appears in the Qur’an. Moreover, his statements on that occasion must be assessed in the context of his having expressly directed them to law enforcement and/or quasi law enforcement agencies, both in Australia and overseas. Even accepting that some of the statements made by Khalid on the other footage advocated more peaceful methods of resolving differences, there can be no doubt whatsoever that at the time of his offending, and for some period prior to that, Khalid had an unwavering devotion to the ideology to which I have referred. His various statements on the YouTube footage make that clear. In making them as he did, Khalid was simply masquerading as a preacher of peaceful religious philosophy.
	
	
	I accept that the opinions expressed by the various witnesses about what they saw as Khalid’s generally non-violent character were earnestly and honestly given. I also accept that there have been some occasions in the past when Khalid has acted in a manner consistent with what is expected of law abiding members of the community. However, what is significant is that the majority of those witnesses who gave evidence confirmed that Khalid had never discussed with them the subject of violent jihad, in circumstances where the evidence establishes that adherence to violent jihad was part of Khalid’s fundamental philosophy. The witnesses who gave that evidence were clearly unaware of the true facts, and specifically of Khalid’s devotion to violent jihad, he having not discussed it with any of them. Similar observations may be made in respect of the evidence given by Mr Mercer, who saw Khalid as, amongst other things, “unsophisticated”. Even accepting that such opinion was genuinely formed, it remains the case that Khalid’s offending demonstrated, in my view, a not insignificant level of sophistication. In all of these circumstances, I do not accept the submission that Khalid was an otherwise peace-loving member of the community, whose participation in the conspiracy should be viewed as an aberration.
	
	
	As I have noted, it was also submitted on behalf of Khalid that any plan was undeveloped and imperfect, to the point where there was really no plan at all. It is true that the target of any proposed attack, or the method by which such an attack might be carried out, had not been precisely determined, although such matters had obviously been discussed. However, even accepting that the plan under discussion was undeveloped in that sense, it involved, at the very least, the use of firearms for the purposes of attacking property and people. Moreover, the fact that the plan may have been at an embryonic stage does not mitigate the seriousness of the offending. This Court must respect the legislative policy of the Parliament to create offences where an offender has not decided precisely what he or she intends to do. In doing so, the Court must also recognise the legislative policy that the prevention of terrorism requires that criminal responsibility arise at an earlier stage than is usually the case for other forms of criminal conduct [158] .
	
	
	It follows that notwithstanding that the conspiracy, and Khalid’s participation in it, did not give rise to any imminent (let alone actual) threat of personal injury or damage to property, a substantial sentence is nevertheless required. It does not follow that merely because the plan may have been in its infancy that the criminal culpability of those involved must be low. The focus must remain upon Khalid’s conduct at the time that the offence was committed [159] . Like all of the participants in the conspiracy, Khalid does not does not stand to be sentenced as though he had committed the acts which were being discussed. However, those acts must necessarily inform the nature and gravity of his offending.
	
	
	I do not accept the submission that the acts which were being discussed are properly described as naïve or fanciful. Such appellations are not apt to describe:
	



	
	discussing the Australian Federal Police building as being a “good target” [160]  for an attack;
	
	
	expressing the view that “something major” should be done [161] ;
	
	
	targeting the headquarters of a police force or intelligence organisation for the purpose of doing “something massive that would get them shocked and stuff up there (sic) organisation” [162] ; or
	
	
	discussing the process of “taking out a dog”, a clear reference to injuring or killing a police officer [163] .
	



	
	The fear and concern which these expressions would necessarily instil in any right-thinking member of the community need no further elucidation. It is also to be borne firmly in mind that those expressions were uttered in circumstances where firearms and ammunition had actually been acquired.
	
	
	I also do not accept the suggestion, inherent in the submissions made on Khalid’s behalf, that the conspiracy was amateurish. There is nothing amateurish about a proposal that firearms be used for the purposes of (inter alia) carrying out a terrorist attack, particularly in circumstances where firearms and ammunition were actually acquired. Such actions reflect a considerable degree of planning as to the method by which such an attack might be carried out. In any event, even the most amateurish and ill-conceived plan has the capacity to cause death to innocent persons, damage to property, and general fear in the community [164] .
	
	
	The fact that Khalid may have had little or no expertise in firearms is not to the point, for two reasons. Firstly, as the Crown submitted, the discharge of a firearm with the intention of destroying property, or killing or injuring another member of the community, requires little expertise. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, this is not a case in which the use of firearms was simply discussed as a method by which an attack could be perpetrated. As I have pointed out, it is a case in which firearms and ammunition were actually acquired.
	
	
	The submissions of the parties debated whether Khalid was properly described as the “leader” of the conspiracy. I have already set out [165]  the approach to be taken in sentencing for the offence of conspiracy. There is limited utility in attempting to establish, with absolute precision, a gradated hierarchy amongst the offenders [166] . Adopting terms such as “leader” may be apt to confuse. I am satisfied that Khalid was responsible for the co-ordination of many aspects of the conspiracy. So much is clear from his conduct in arranging meetings at his home at which the other conspirators attended [167] , issuing instructions to other conspirators [168] , reiterating his extremist views and promoting violent jihad in conversations with IM [169] , speaking with Jibryl in code about ammunition [170]  and retaining documents at his premises [171] . Whilst all of the conspirators obviously played an important role, Khalid’s actions place him at a level above the others. His various self-serving statements to Dr Nielssen concerning his offending are deserving of no weight.
	
	
	Khalid was an admitted participant in a criminal conspiracy to engage in acts in preparation for terrorism, in which he occupied a co-ordinating role. In offending as he did, Khalid demonstrated that he was a devout terrorist. He was corrupted by a dangerous, violent and perverted ideology to which he unequivocally subscribed, which he wore as a badge of honour, but which has no place in any civilised society. His offending falls towards the higher end of the scale of objective seriousness. Considerations of general deterrence assume particular significance in determining an appropriate sentence [172] .
	


KHALID’S SUBJECTIVE CASE

Submissions on behalf of the Crown


	
	The Crown acknowledged that Khalid had pleaded guilty, but pointed out that the plea had been entered at a late stage, after lengthy case management, and following the completion of all pre-trial arguments. Whilst the Crown did not suggest that Khalid was not entitled to some discount to reflect his plea, the effect of the Crown’s submissions was that taking all matters into account, any discount should be minimal.
	
	
	The Crown accepted that Khalid was 20 years of age at the time of his offending and that he is now 22 years of age. Whilst acknowledging that youth can operate as a mitigating factor, the Crown submitted that where countervailing considerations such as the gravity of the offending played a part, any significance to be given to youth was significantly reduced. The Crown submitted that when sentencing for matters of this nature, considerations of community protection, general deterrence, specific deterrence, denunciation and incapacitation must take precedence.
	


Submissions on behalf of Khalid


	
	Senior counsel submitted that Khalid was a youthful offender, who had pleaded guilty in circumstances where the evidence against him was far from overwhelming. It was submitted that in these circumstances, his plea should be seen as one which had facilitated the course of justice and had saved the community the considerable expense of a trial. It was submitted that the plea should be regarded as being particularly significant in circumstances where the trial process could have provided Khalid with a “platform” on which to express his views and ideologies.
	
	
	It was submitted that I should conclude, principally on the basis of the case notes annexed to the affidavit of Mr Piazza to which I have referred, that Khalid was a “troubled man in prison” [173] , whose inherently harsh conditions of custody had been exacerbated by regular “lock-ins”, and the limitations placed upon the availability of further education. It was submitted that despite these factors, the evidence of Mr Piazza supported a conclusion that Khalid was properly described as a “good prisoner”.
	
	
	Whilst senior counsel accepted that general deterrence was obviously of importance in determining an appropriate sentence [174]  he submitted that in circumstances where Khalid’s demonstrated behaviour in custody had been positive, and where there was some likelihood that his movements would be monitored even after he had concluded his sentence, the need for personal deterrence was lessened. In terms of any adherence to extremist ideology, senior counsel repeated his submission that I should accept the general tenor of the evidence given by those witnesses called in Khalid’s case, and conclude that Khalid was not, and is not, a person of violence. In this regard, senior counsel drew particular attention to the evidence of Khalid’s sister Mouminah, to whom he is said to have expressed disagreement with the philosophies of ISIS. Whilst expressly accepting that this did not constitute evidence of a full renunciation of any previously held ideology, senior counsel submitted that this evidence, together with Khalid’s plea and his expressed desire to speak to a Rabbi, established, at the very least, that Khalid had distanced himself from the ideology which underpinned his offending.
	


Submissions on behalf of the Crown in reply


	
	In terms of Khalid’s conditions of custody, the Crown submitted that the evidence established nothing more than the unsurprising fact that Khalid was “doing it hard” [175] . The Crown also emphasised that notwithstanding the case notes, the opinion of Dr Nielssen (upon whose report Khalid relied) made it clear that he was suffering from no psychiatric illness.
	
	
	The Crown relied on its previous submissions regarding the evidence of those witnesses called in Khalid’s case. To the extent that evidence was given by Khalid’s sister Mouminah that Khalid had made statements to her whilst in custody disassociating himself from the philosophies of ISIS, the Crown submitted that such evidence was of little weight. Even accepting that the statement was in fact made, the Crown submitted that it amounted to nothing more than a self-serving statement made to a third party which was not subject to cross-examination. In all of these circumstances, the Crown submitted that the entirety of the evidence, even when taken at its highest, fell substantially short of establishing any renunciation of extremist ideology, and that this necessarily had a bearing on my assessment of any expressed remorse, and the prospects of rehabilitation.
	


Consideration


	
	Some aspects of the Khalid’s subjective case (and indeed the subjective cases of each of the offenders) are to be considered by reference to s. 16A of the Act. However, s. 16A is not exhaustive, and that there are, in the case of each offender, relevant factors which fall outside that specific provision.
	


The plea of guilty: s. 16A(2)(g)


	
	Khalid entered a plea of guilty on 31 July 2017, which was the day fixed for his trial. There is some conflict of authority as to whether, in sentencing a federal offender, a Court is entitled to have regard to the so-called “utilitarian value” of a plea of guilty. The prevailing view in this state has been that the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty is not to be taken into account in such a case [176] . That position has also been taken in the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory [177] . A different view has been taken by the Court of Appeal in Victoria [178] .
	
	
	In R v Ghazzawy [179]  I summarised the principles which presently govern the position in this state:
	



	
	the decision of the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [180]  does not apply to sentencing for federal offences [181] ;
	
	
	it is not permissible to apply a discount to a sentence for a federal offender on the objective basis that the plea has saved the community the expense of a contested hearing and, as a consequence, the range of utilitarian discount identified in Thomson, namely 10% to 25%, has no application to the sentencing of a federal offender [182] ;
	
	
	a federal offender can obtain a discount in recognition of a plea of guilty if the Court concludes that such a plea demonstrates the subjective mitigating factors of genuine remorse, and/or acceptance of responsibility and/or a willingness to facilitate the course of justice [183] ;
	
	
	a guilty plea does not entitle a federal offender to a discount on sentence unless one of the three subjective findings referred to in (iii) above is made, or agreed to by the prosecution, so as to warrant some reduction in sentence;
	
	
	a significant factor relevant to the extent of any discount or reduction in sentence is the timing of the plea, and whether it was entered at the first reasonable opportunity [184] ;
	
	
	there is no scope for an automatic discount of 10% for a late plea of guilty. Subjective findings must justify any discount given, especially for a late plea, and in some cases it may be appropriate that there be no discount at all because there is only an objective utilitarian benefit;
	
	
	the court may specifically quantify the discount which is applied although providing it is taken into account, there is no obligation on the court to do so [185] ;
	
	
	the strength of the Crown case may be taken into account in assessing the subjective value of a guilty plea, and the Court may consider whether the offender’s plea was motivated by a willingness to facilitate the course of justice, or was simply a recognition of the inevitable. It follows that a guilty plea entered in the face of a strong Crown case should not be afforded as much weight as a plea entered in circumstances where the prosecution case was weak [186] :
	



	
	In the present case, I am satisfied that Khalid’s plea may be some evidence of contrition and acceptance of responsibility. I did not understand the Crown to argue to the contrary. Equally, the plea was entered at a late stage, after considerable case management, and in the face of what, in my view, was a strong circumstantial case. In all of the circumstances, and applying the principles to which I have referred, the appropriate discount is one of 10%.
	


Personal deterrence: s. 16A(2)(j)


	
	I have dealt below with the issue of Khalid’s prospects of rehabilitation. Having regard to the conclusions that I have reached as to that matter, there is in my view a strong need for any sentence to reflect considerations of personal deterrence.
	


Character, antecedents, age, means and physical or mental condition: s. 16A(2)(m)


	
	As previously noted, Khalid is presently 22 years of age and was 20 at the time of the offending. He has a single entry on his criminal history which was of a comparatively minor nature and which did not result in the imposition of a conviction. I accept that he has no history of violent offending. I also accept that he has worked in various community capacities. I have taken all of those factors into account. I have already referred at length to the evidence given by a number of witnesses as to what they considered to be Khalid’s prior good character. Generally speaking they expressed surprise and shock at his admitted involvement in the offending. I have already set out my assessment of that evidence, and how it should be treated.
	
	
	The principles governing the sentencing of youthful offenders have been discussed on many occasions. Those cited by McClellan CJ at CL in KT v R [187]  may be summarised as follows:
	



	
	considerations of general deterrence and principles of retribution are, in most cases, of less significance than they would be when sentencing an adult for the same offence. In recognition of the capacity for young people to reform and mould their character to conform to society’s norms, considerable emphasis is placed on the need to provide an opportunity for rehabilitation (at [22]);
	
	
	the law recognises the potential for the cognitive, emotional and/or psychological immaturity of a young person to contribute to their breach of the law. Accordingly, allowance will be made for an offender’s youth and not just their biological age (at [23]);
	
	
	where the immaturity of the offender is a significant factor in the commission of the offence, the criminality involved will be less than if the same offence was committed by an adult (at [23]);
	
	
	although accepted to be of less significance than when sentencing adults, considerations of general deterrence and retribution cannot be completely ignored when sentencing young offenders. There remains a significant public interest in deterring antisocial conduct (at [24]);
	
	
	the emphasis given to rehabilitation rather than general deterrence and retribution when sentencing young offenders may be moderated when the young person has conducted him or herself in the way an adult might conduct him or herself, and has committed a crime of violence or considerable gravity (at [25]);
	
	
	in determining whether a young offender has engaged in “adult behaviour”, the Court will look to various matters including the use of weapons, planning or pre-meditation, the existence of an extensive criminal history and the nature and circumstances of the offence. Where some or all of these factors are present the need for rehabilitation of the offender may be diminished by the need to protect society (at [25]);
	
	
	the weight to be given to considerations relevant to a person’s youth diminishes the closer the offender approaches the age of maturity. A ‘child offender’ of almost eighteen years of age cannot expect to be treated substantially differently from an offender who is just over eighteen years of age. However, the younger the offender, the greater the weight to be afforded to the element of youth (at [26]).
	



	
	In BP v R [188]  Hodgson JA accepted the correctness of those principles set out by McClellan CJ in KT [189]  before emphasising [190]  that Courts should not be “over-ready” to discount the relevance of an offender’s youth on the basis that the offender has engaged in adult behaviour or acted as an adult. In the same case Johnson J, having set out the principles in KT said [191] :
	


[75] [T]he law recognises the potential for the cognitive, emotional and/or psychological immaturity of a young person to contribute to their breach of the law. The law considers youth and not just biological age. Where immaturity of an offender is a significant contributing factor to the commission of the offence, the criminality involved will be less than if the same offence was committed by an adult.”


	
	In JM v R [192]   Simpson J (as her Honour then was), having reviewed the authorities, said:
	


[108] It seems to me that the weight of authority is that the seriousness of an offence is relevant to the emphasis that can be given to the youth of an offender. That does not mean that youth is not an important consideration; but retribution and deterrence cannot, in a case as serious as the present, give way entirely or even substantially to the interests of rehabilitation…


	
	In R v Tran [193]  Callaway JA observed that in the case of a youthful offender, rehabilitation is usually far more important than general deterrence. At the same time, his Honour emphasised that there are cases where just punishment, general deterrence, and other sentencing objectives carry at least equal importance. In Azzopardi v R [194]  it was observed that whilst, as the level of seriousness of the criminality increases there will be a corresponding reduction in the mitigatory effect of an offender’s youth, it is only in the circumstances of the gravest criminal offending, and where there is no realistic prospect of rehabilitation, that the mitigatory consideration of youth is viewed as being all but extinguished. More recently in HJ v R [195]  Garling J (with whom Hoeben CJ at CL and R S Hulme AJ agreed) observed:
	


[56] It is undoubted that the youth of an offender is a relevant factor to be considered in assessing what sentence ought be imposed. The Court makes an allowance for the youth of the offender because immaturity is usually involved. Where that immaturity is a significant contributing factor to an offence, then it may fairly be said that the criminality involved is less than it would be in the case of an adult of more mature years: R v Hearne [2001] NSWCCA 37 at [25].


	
	Finally, DPP v MHK (A Pseudonym) [196]  was a case of a 17 year old offender who had pleaded guilty to doing acts in preparation for, or planning, a terrorist act. In terms of his youth, the Court made the following relevant observations [197] :
	


As the authorities, to which we have referred, make plain, while youth is relevant in determining the weight to be given to general deterrence and denunciation in the sentencing equation, its weight is diminished, quite measurably, in cases such as this, in which a youthful offender either participates in, or plans to carry out, actions of extreme violence. The protection of our society, and the upholding of its most fundamental values, necessitate that in cases such as this the sentencing considerations of general deterrence and denunciation must be given primacy above the ameliorating effect of youth.


	
	Khalid’s offending was obviously of the utmost seriousness. His act of agreeing with the other conspirators to commit acts in preparation for a terrorist act is properly regarded as adult-like behaviour. It involved considerable planning, and detailed discussions about the nature of a proposed act of terrorism and the possible targets upon which it might be perpetrated. The agreement also involved the acquisition of firearms and ammunition. Those circumstances highlight a need to protect society. They serve to reduce the significance of issues of rehabilitation.
	
	
	Further, and although he might be regarded as youthful in relative terms, Khalid was substantially beyond the age of 18 at the time of his offending. As McClellan CJ at CL pointed out in KT, the weight to be given to youth diminishes the closer an offender approaches the age of maturity.
	
	
	I have made reference [198]  to the opinions expressed by Dr Nielssen as to Khalid’s youth, and its connection with his offending. Those opinions are expressed in somewhat equivocal terms. Having made reference to the fact that Khalid was “very young” at the time of his offending, Dr Nielssen said that Khalid would be expected to “mature in his attitudes over time”. One of the attitudes apparently presently held by Khalid was said to stem from his “indignation at perceived discrimination and mistreatment of Muslims”. Dr Nielssen did not state, in specific terms, that Khalid was suffering from any cognitive or psychological immaturity at the time of (and which contributed to) his offending. In any event, his opinions are based, at least in part, upon accounts given to him by Khalid which are not the subject of sworn evidence. As a result, those opinions are deserving of limited weight. It follows that the evidence does not support a conclusion that immaturity was a significant contributing factor to Khalid’s offending. In all of these circumstances, Khalid’s youth is of little weight in determining an appropriate sentence.
	
	
	Finally, and irrespective of the case notes annexed to Mr Piazza’s affidavit to which I was taken in the course of submissions, I do not accept that Khalid is suffering from any relevant mental condition. Notwithstanding the submissions made on his behalf regarding the incomplete history said to have been provided to Dr Nielssen (a proposition completely unsupported by the evidence) it remains the position that the report of Dr Nielssen was tendered, and relied upon, in Khalid’s case. Dr Nielssen expressed the unequivocal view that Khalid was not thought to require any specific psychiatric care or counselling.
	


Contrition: s. 16A(2)(f)

The prospect of rehabilitation: s. 16A(2)(n)


	
	Khalid expressed his “deep regret” to Dr Nielssen, and his intention to work towards his rehabilitation with a view to “communicating peacefully” with the authorities [199] . His sister gave evidence that he made statements in which he disagreed with the philosophies of ISIS [200] . Lengthy submissions were made regarding how this evidence ought be viewed and assessed. The resolution of that issue requires reference to some authorities.
	
	
	In R v Qutami [201]  Smart AJ (with whom Spigelman CJ and Simpson J (as her Honour then was) agreed) said that considerable caution should be exercised in relying upon statements made by an offender to third parties, including psychiatrists and psychologists, when no sworn evidence is given by that offender. That is not to say such statements are deserving of no weight at all. However, his Honour expressed the view that in many cases, only very limited weight can be given to them.
	
	
	Smart AJ’s observations assume considerable significance in the present case. The rehabilitation of an offender who pleads guilty to an offence such as this is necessarily dependent, at least in part, upon the offender renouncing previously held extremist views [202] . If a sentencing court is satisfied that such an offender has resiled from such views, the prospects of rehabilitation are enhanced, and the Court must make an appropriate allowance for that fact on sentence [203] .
	
	
	The onus of establishing the abandonment of a previously held extremist ideology is on the offender, and is to be established on the balance of probabilities [204] . Whilst an offender is under no obligation to give sworn evidence on sentence, it may be open to a court to conclude that the failure to do so means that the onus has not been discharged [205] . In the present case Khalid has chosen not to give evidence. As I have said, the decision in Qutami is not authority for the proposition that statements made to third parties are deserving of no weight at all. However, in the absence of sworn evidence, the weight to be attached to such statements made by Khalid to Dr Nielssen and to his sister is necessarily limited.
	
	
	Senior counsel emphasised that Khalid had expressed a desire to see a Rabbi. I do not attach the significance to that factor which was urged upon me by senior counsel. In terms of assessing the prospects of rehabilitation, the bare fact that Khalid has made that request is of limited import in the absence of any evidence as to the underlying reason for it.
	
	
	I accept that Khalid’s plea of guilty may be some evidence of contrition. It may also be taken as some indication of stepping away from his previously held views. To that limited extent, such factors may point favourably towards rehabilitation. However, I can put it no higher than that, and I express those views with caution [206] . It must also be remembered that issues of rehabilitation assume less significance in sentencing for offending of this kind [207] .
	


Other factors


	
	Submissions were made regarding Khalid’s conditions of custody, an issue which does not fall squarely within s. 16A but which is nevertheless relevant on sentence. Dr Nielssen formed the impression that Khalid seemed to have adjusted to his custodial conditions. That said, there can be no doubt that those conditions are harsh, and I have proceeded on the basis that they are likely to prevail for the duration of any sentence I impose. It is open to me to make some allowance for Khalid’s conditions of custody and I have done so. However, that allowance is neither mathematical nor, in the circumstances, substantial [208] .
	
	
	Khalid has been in custody since 23 December 2014 [209] . Any sentence imposed should commence on that date.

THE EVIDENCE TENDERED BY THE CROWN

The facts in relation to the conspiracy offence


	
	The statement of facts tendered by the Crown against Jibryl in respect of the conspiracy [218]  was in the following terms [219] :
	


BACKGROUND

A.   Ideology

1.   The offender Jibryl Almaouie (“the offender”), Sulayman Khalid and “IM” (together, “the conspirators”) engaged in the conspiracy whilst adherents of the ideology of violent jihad.  This is the ideology that inspires ISIS (the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria), and like‑minded groups and their supporters. [220]  ISIS clothing, flag and images including giving the ISIS salute were among the material seized from the conspirators.

2.   The cause that was to be advanced in the proposed terrorist act or acts was that of violent jihad. The essential feature of the cause, which the conspirators believed to be a religious obligation, was to engage in violence to advance what they considered to be the interests of Islam. They believed Islam to be under attack from various Western countries, in Syria and the Middle East, and also in Australia. They also believed that those who died pursuing violent jihad were martyrs, who would be rewarded in paradise.

3.   During the conspiracy period (that is, between about 7 November 2014 and 18 December 2014), each of the conspirators was committed to Islam and they often spoke about it and included it in their daily lives. Whilst the word “jihad” is used and understood amongst the wider Muslim community to mean “spiritual struggle”, the conspirators used the term (and possessed material that used the term) to mean “violent jihad”.

4.   During the period of the conspiracy and for some time before, Khalid was active in seeking to advance Islam. He had actively proselytized for Islam in the street and posted videos of those activities online. His activity was known to his friends, including (amongst others) the offender, who had a video on his phone of Khalid preaching Islam in the street.

5.   Khalid had publicly displayed his support for the violent jihad espoused by ISIS. One way he did so was by obtaining and wearing clothing with badges and adornments of ISIS. When police executed a search warrant at his premises on 18 December 2014, the items they found included clothing bearing identifiable ISIS markings and a series of printed A4 sheets which, when placed together, formed an almost complete ISIS banner. Furthermore, Khalid had appeared on the “Insight Program”, which was televised nationally, and supported the violent jihadi ideology of ISIS.

6.   Khalid had also made a YouTube video which he had posted on the internet, titled “A Direct Message to the Secret Services, A call to Taweed, Millatu Ibrahim”. In that video, which features an ISIS emblem, Khalid makes a thinly veiled threat against various Western security services, including those of Australia. The video was one of 25 published online by Khalid between 25 May 2013 and 7 December 2014, the majority of which show Khalid preaching and discussing Islam.

7.   Khalid was also the conspirator who sent religious advice and sayings to the other conspirators.

8.   The offender shared the other conspirators’ adherence to extreme Islamic views and violent jihad. When police searched his premises at 73C Clarence Street Condell Park on 18 December 2014, they found the following items (amongst others) in his bedroom:

a)   A black flag with Arabic writing;

b)   A book titled “SAS Survival Guide”;

c)   A black shirt with Islamic writing and various headscarfs;

d)   Two jihadi books titled “Milestones” by Sayyid QUTB (an Islamic radical who is regarded as an inspiration for groups such as Al-Qaeda and ISIS).

B.   Outline of the conspiracy [221] 

…

DOCUMENTS

A.   Overview - documents’ purpose and circumstances of creation

39.   The offender wrote two of the relevant documents connected with preparation of terrorist acts.  The six relevant documents were connected with the preparations for a terrorist act or acts both on their face, and in the circumstances of their creation. The documents record a form of discussion and they were read, discussed and added to as the discussion continued. The forensic evidence shows that the documents were handed to others, apart from the author. In some cases, writing was added to the documents by someone other than the original author. The documents demonstrate an active and real consideration of the type of terrorist act contemplated, and its target. They outline different methods for the commission of one or more acts of terrorism and set out possible targets.

40.   The documents also demonstrate that the terrorist act or acts contemplated involved the use of firearms. They demonstrate that the type of acts being planned involved the killing of police - referred to disparagingly at times as “dogs” - and government officials. The documents demonstrate the religious inspiration for the act of terrorism contemplated, and reflect the violent jihadi ideology of the group (including by express references in the documents to jihad, religious obligation and the defence of Islam) [222] .

…

FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION

A.   Firearms in the offender’s possession [223] 

…

B.   Firearms sourced by “IM” [224] 

...

INTERCEPTED TELEPHONE COMMUNICATIONS

60.   Khalid’s telecommunications service was lawfully intercepted from 7 November 2014 to 24 December 2014. Monitoring of this service confirmed that Khalid was in regular contact with the other conspirators and Mohamed Al Maouie, Ghazzawy and Said. At the time, the services used by each were:   

a)   KHALID: 0405215760 - subscribed in the name of Suleiman HALID;

b)   “IM”: 0420404974 - subscribed in the name of Adam STEVENS;

c)   THE OFFENDER J ALMAOUIE: 0421937701 - subscribed in the name of Lady Nho TRAI;

d)   M. ALMAOUIE: 0428815371 - subscribed in the name of Mr Abdallah ALMAOUIE;

e)   GHAZZAWY: 0420298595 - subscribed in the name of Ms Amira GHAZZAWY;

f)   F. SAID: 0404222303 - subscribed in the name of Farhad SAID; and

g)   F. SAID: 0434914040 - subscribed in the name of Fred JOHNSON.

61.   With the exception of one of Said’s services and that of Ghazzawy and Mohamed Al Maouie, these names were intentionally false. Whilst recognising that in some cases the service was in a parent’s name, the use of obviously false names is relied upon by the Crown as supporting the existence of the conspiracy, the purpose of subscribing in a false name being to make it more difficult to track or identify the subscriber if the call was overheard.

62.   In many of the intercepted telephone communications between the conspirators, code words were used. The conspirators knew that their activities had to be kept secret from the authorities, and attempted to cloak the true meaning of their conversations.

63.   The transcripts of the intercepted communications between the conspirators and others during the charge period will be tendered on sentence.

64.   Intercepted conversations between the offender and Khalid include a conversation at 2:47pm on 16 December 2014, when Khalid and the offender had a conversation relating to firearms. This conversation referred to the Lindt café siege. Immediately after this they spoke in Arabic and the offender said “I need to get married bro, straight out”. Khalid replied, “we need to all get married”. Later in the conversation Khalid said: “Bro, I looked at the flamin’ - the flippin’, um, what’s it called, the contract you gave me yesterday.” The offender laughed and said, “Straight flame, bro”. This coded conversation relates to the firearms found at the offender’s home on 18 December 2014 (which are referred to above).

65.   At 2:53pm on 16 December 2014, Khalid and the offender had a further conversation during which they used code, and referred to food in place of ammunition; for example: cake, apricots, marshmellows, apples, grapes, strawberries, sponges, and other terms. The offender also referred to the Lindt Cafe siege immediately after talking about “sponges”. The conversation included the following exchanges:

J. ALMAOUIE:   “Mate, unbelievable. Like, you can’t find that proper ingredient. Like, that dessert is, like, best served cold - - -” 

...

KHALID:   “Or the flippin’ - I mean for the - for the cake, no way, bro. It beats every cake.”

J. ALMAOUIE:   “(Laughs) Worst thing on top, bro.”

KHALID:   “Well, what - what did you put in the cake, bro?”

J. ALMAOUIE:   “In the cake?”

KHALID:   “... (indistinct) ... a lot of ingredients to put in the cake.”

J. ALMAOUIE:   “Yeah, like fruits and like apricots, marshmallows, ah, apples, grapes, strawberries, sponges in between.”

   ...

J. ALMAOUIE:   “I call it sponges ‘cause it looks like - ah, I don’t know, it looks like a sponge but it’s not.”

KHALID:   “Yeah, I know. Made out of - - -”

J. ALMAOUIE:   “No, you know this thing on TV, friggin’ I can hear people talking downstairs about it. It’s drivin’ me nuts. That’s it. End of story. Flippin’ the guy got popped. He died. He had the hostages, friggin’ end of story. I don’t want to hear it. Fuck, they drove me nuts. They just brag and brag about it.”

KHALID:   “Yeah.”

66.   The bulk of the intercepted calls and messages were between Khalid and “IM”. Examples of telephone communications between Khalid, “IM” and the offender follow [225] .

MEETINGS OF THE CONSPIRATORS AND OTHERS [226] 

…

ARREST AND CHARGING

89.   On 10 December 2015, Khalid, “IM”, the offender and Ghazzawy were arrested and charged. Mohamed Al Maouie was arrested on 23 December 2015. Farhad Said was arrested on 26 May 2016. Each was provided with their legal rights under Part 1C of the Crimes Act 1914 and declined to participate in a record of interview.

90.   The offender has been in custody since his arrest on 10 December 2015.

The facts in relation to the firearms offences 


	
	The Crown tendered a separate statement of facts in respect of the firearms offences [227]  in the following terms:
	


1. About 12.50pm on 18 December 2014, the offender Jibryl ALMAOUIE was approached by both New South Wales and Federal police as he neared his vehicle, which was parked on level 9 of the Bankstown Centro Shopping Centre.

2. A Search Warrant (person) was executed upon the offender with the conversation between FA JESSEP and the offender recorded on a hand held digital recorder. During this search, an Apple brand iPhone 5 was seized. During this recording, the offender indicated he resides at 37 Robinson Street, Wiley Park and the Wiley Park address is where he slept last night. This is contrary to physical surveillance, who had the offender stay at 73c Clarence Street, Condell Park.

3. About 1.30pm on 18 December 2014, police executed a search warrant upon the residential address of 73C Clarence Street, Condell Park. At the time, the house was occupied by three juveniles, being the younger siblings of the offender.

4. The premises is a two storey, brick veneer town house consisting of a kitchen, lounge room, dining room, laundry, toilet and a single garage on the ground floor. The upstairs area consists of two bedrooms, a third room used as a bedroom/study, a bathroom and linen cupboard.

5. About 2.10pm, Raowa HADDAD the occupant and mother of the offender arrived at the house. The search warrant was explained to her by police. This conversation was recorded on audio and video.

6. During the search, Raowa HADDAD indicated she usually resides at the premises with her three younger children. However since she recently had surgery, her two adult sons being Mohamad ALMAOUIE and the offender have also been staying over to help manage her younger children.

7. Raowa HADDAD indicated her and her daughter sleep in the main bedroom and both the younger boys sleep in the second bedroom. She further indicated that Mohamed has been staying in the garage and she had setup the upstairs spare room (bedroom/study) for the offender to stay in while she recovers from the surgery.

8. The upstairs bedroom/study contained two mattresses stacked on top of one another on the floor with no sheets or covers, a desk, a filing cabinet and built-in wardrobe with two sliding mirrored doors.

9. During the search of the built in wardrobe in the room occupied by the offender, police located a small black leather bag containing a number of live rounds of ammunition at the back of the top shelf on the right hand side behind a number of other items. Also at the back of this shelf on the right hand side, police located a bolt action rifle (303) ""ENFIELD"", which was wrapped in floral fabric material. This rifle had a magazine inserted with a number of live rounds contained in the magazine. The chamber of the rifle was empty.

10. Raowa HADDAD was questioned about the rifle, stating she had never seen it before. Raowa also confirmed the offender stayed in this room the night before.

11. About 6.55pm, police located a 12 gauge double barrel, under/over style barrel from a shotgun ""Lanber"", wrapped in a pillow case. This barrel was located at the back of the top shelf on the left hand side. Each barrel contained one live round of .12 gauge ammunition.

12. About 7.40pm in a black coloured suit case found in the bottom left of the wardrobe, police located a black toiletries bag which contained x 21 large calibre live rounds of ammunition, x2 bags each containing small calibre rounds of live ammunition.

13. About 7.43pm in a black coloured suitcase with the name 'Jibryl ALMAOUIE', written on it, an address of '9 Stiller Place, Greenacre' and a mobile phone number '0405 949116', police located a wooden stock for the 12 gauge double barrel, under and over shotgun ""Lanber"" located on the shelf above. This stock was wrapped in a black coloured pillow case and found in the lining of the suitcase.

14. About 9.20pm police forced open a locked filing cabinet/drawer in the same room. Within this filing cabinet police located a black bag containing approximately x20 12 gauge live rounds of ammunition.

15. About 9.45pm in the same filing cabinet police located a shortened 12 gauge barrel, sawn off timber stock ""COOEY"" and x1 live 12 gauge round of ammunition. Also located within this locked drawer, police located various documentation in the name of Jibryl ALMAOUIE. These documents included Tax File documents, Bank documents, an Australian Passport and various other documents in the name of the offender. The DNA profile and fingerprints of the offender were located on the shortened 12 gauge barrel ""COOEY"".

16. Also located in this locked filing cabinet/drawer, police located a Bandolier which contained a quantity of live ammunition.

17. Located taped to the inside rear wall of the filing cabinet / drawer directly behind the bottom drawer, police located x5 boxes of 'Champion' brand Super GL live 12 gauge rounds of ammunition, x2 'Winchester' branded 6.5mm x 55 'Swedish* rifle ammunition, x1 long round of ammunition, x1 'Dynmint Nobel 0.22 calibre box, x4

0.22 calibre 'Bushman' brand long rifle hollow point live rounds of ammunition, x2 ammunition clips with x1 clip containing x1 live round of ammunition.

18. After finding a number of the firearms and ammunition both Raowa HADDAD and Mohamed ALMAOUIE were cautioned and questioned about those items. Both replied with 'No Comment'.

19. On Saturday 20 December 2014, the three firearms were fingerprinted and DNA tested, with the fingerprint technicians able to locate a single un-identified fingerprint on the shortened 12 gauge shot gun.

20. On Saturday 20 December 2014, the firearms were examined by a ballistic expert and all three firearms were certified as a 'Firearm' under the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW). All of the ammunition cartridges seized were certified as ""ammunition"" in accordance with the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW). The ballistics expert also found that the exhibit cartridges of ammunition were suitable for use in each of the three firearms seized.

21. The Crime Scene Fingerprint Examination Report prepared by Ana LAIC dated 16 March 2015, identified the right palm print of the offender on the barrel of the ""COOEY"" shortened firearm.

22. The Crime Scene Fingerprint Examination Report prepared by Ana LAIC dated 6 October 2015, identified a finger print of the offender on the tape used to hold the boxes of ammunition located inside the rear wall of the filing cabinet / drawer directly behind the bottom drawer.

23. The DNA analyst report of Ms Gita LALA dated 6 July 2015 identified the DNA profile of the offender upon the stock area of the ""COOEY"" shortened firearm, the computer keyboard and iPhone belonging to the offender. In addition, the DNA profile of the offender was identified on the boxes of ammunition marked ""Dynmint Nobel .22 gauge box""; ""Bushman Hollow Point"" box; and on the inside and the outside of the black toiletries bag containing 21 x large calibre rounds and 2 bags containing small calibre rounds (which was found in the bottom left of the wardrobe). The major component of the DNA profile located on the items were found to be at least 100 billion times more likely if the major component of the observed DNA profile originated from Jibryl ALMAOUIE than if it originated from another unknown, unrelated individual selected at random from the Australian Caucasian sub-population.

24. The police were unable to locate the offender between the 19 and 23 December 2014. The police applied for first instance warrants for these offences on 23 December 2014.

25. On 9 January 2015, the offender attended Sydney Police Centre in the company of his solicitor and police arrested him. The offender was offered the opportunity to participate in an electronically recorded interview, however he declined.

Jibryl’s criminal history


	
	Jibryl has no prior convictions [228] .
	


The evidence of Mr Piazza


	
	The evidence of Mr Piazza [229]  establishes that Jibryl is currently classified as an AA Extreme High Risk Restricted Inmate. The restrictions about which Mr Piazza spoke in respect of Khalid [230]  and about which he spoke in the evidence he gave in Mohamed’s proceedings [231]  apply generally to Jibryl. Specifically, Jibryl presently has three approved personal visitors and one approved psychologist/psychiatrist [232] . He is at stage 3, level 3 of his behaviour management level and, like all other inmates, will have greater access to amenities as he progresses [233] . At the time of Mr Piazza swearing his affidavit, Jibryl had not sought to enrol in the PRISM program [234]  although it is apparent that he has since done so [235] . According to Mr Piazza, there is no information to suggest that Jibryl has renounced any extremist ideology [236] .
	
	
	Mr Piazza’s affidavit annexed a number of case notes to which I was taken in the course evidence. A note prepared on 17 March 2015 recorded that Jibryl had enrolled in a welding course [237] . A further note prepared on 15 May 2015 by Ahmed Kilani, a prison Chaplain, recorded that Jibryl had expressed his concerns about a search of his cell that morning and had reported to Mr Kilani that he had lost more than 20 kilograms in weight over a period of time [238] . Mr Kilani formed the view that Jibryl was “struggling in adjusting to gaol life”.
	
	
	On 18 May 2015 Jibryl was spoken to by Fatima Al Sibai, a psychologist [239] . He told her that he had commenced to exhibit “pervasive OCD type behaviours” at the age of 15, had attended four different schools, and had thereafter had several jobs, each lasting 2 to 3 months. He said that during that period he wanted to be alone and would tend to isolate himself. As a result, he was provided with tasks to address his anxiety related issues.
	
	
	On 29 May 2015 Mick Marshal prepared a case note in which he made reference to Jibryl having worked in the prison metal shop for approximately 4 months [240] . Mr Marshal described Jibryl as being “always polite and co-operative”. He confirmed that Jibryl had enrolled in a welding certificate course through TAFE and that all reports indicated that Jibryl was “doing well” in that course. Mr Marshal described Jibryl as a “key worker” and a person in respect of whom there were “nil issues”. He prepared a similar note on 16 September 2015 in which he confirmed that Jibryl continued to do well and was responsible for overseeing one of the gaol’s biggest outside contracts in metal work [241] . He described Jibryl as a person who “excels in fabrication logistics” and he again confirmed that Jibryl was an inmate in respect of whom there were “nil issues”. A case note of 18 November 2015 confirmed that Jibryl had completed the welding course [242] .
	


THE EVIDENCE TENDERED BY JIBRYL


	
	Jibryl’s mother described him as a “kind, compassionate and gentle soul” who, as a child, suffered from growth deficiencies which were monitored by a paediatrician for a number of years [243] . She said that during most of his school years Jibryl had been teased and bullied by his peers, a situation brought about by the fact that he was physically much smaller than the majority of them. As a consequence, he suffered from low self-esteem as an adolescent. She said that her divorce in 2008 had had a traumatic effect on Jibryl because he had been required to assume responsibility for a number of additional roles within the family, at a time when he was personally struggling to deal with the hardship of the divorce.
	
	
	Ms Haddad also explained the circumstances in which Jibryl had been engaged on two separate occasions. The first was in 2013 when the relationship was terminated by his then fiancée. The second was in 2014 when, the engagement having been announced in August, it was terminated by his second fiancée’s family in November over a dispute concerning the amount of a promised dowry. Ms Haddad said that the impact upon Jibryl of these circumstances caused him to become depressed.
	
	
	Ms Haddad said that Jibryl’s offending was not reflective of his peaceful and harmless nature, and that he was known for his love, empathy and kindness. She described him as being “profoundly remorseful”, and expressed confidence that he had learned from what he had done [244] . She said that he would, when given the opportunity to do so in the future, lead a meaningful life.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt saw Jibryl on 6 August 2015. On the basis of the history provided, and the other material made available to him, Dr Allnutt said that Jibryl had manifested a variety of psychiatric symptoms from a young age which had attracted various diagnoses including anxiety, OCD, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia spectrum disorders [245] . He said that at the time of the examination, Jibryl had manifested a “constellation of psychiatric conditions, predominately anxiety, depressive and psychotic symptoms” [246] . Dr Allnutt was unable to reach a diagnosis of bipolar affected disorder and he did not suggest that any of Jibryl’s symptomology was casually related to his offending. He said that Jibryl was preoccupied with the fact of his incarceration, and experienced associated anxiety about the sentence proceedings and the impact upon his family [247] .
	
	
	Dr Furst saw Jibryl in custody on 29 September 2017. In terms of his offending, and with particular reference to his authorship of documents, Dr Furst recorded Jibryl as saying [248] :
	


I was angry at the time. It’s just a piece of paper. I was upset about Muslim brothers being killed overseas.


	
	Jibryl told Dr Furst that he “wanted to let his anger out on a piece of paper”. He claimed that he was “a bit naïve” and did not appreciate how seriously his actions could be taken [249] . Dr Furst then recorded the following [250] :
	


He regretted his actions, stating “I should not have written it” … put people into harm. My family in harm, Financial burden. This paper was a moment of anger.

However, his assertions in this respect about his role in the conspiracy and his thinking at the time being driven by a ‘moment of anger’ would appear to be at odds with the tone of the writing, possession of firearms, use of code, and apparent preparations made by (him) and his co-offender to prepare for or plan a terrorist act.


	
	Dr Furst said that Jibryl was suffering from high levels of stress and anxiety and that he met the criteria for diagnoses of [251] :
	



	
	obsessive compulsive disorder (which was the primary disorder);
	
	
	generalised anxiety disorder;
	
	
	panic disorder; and
	
	
	substance use disorder.
	



	
	Dr Furst said that there was no causative link between any of these disorders and Jibryl’s offending [252] . However, he expressed the view that Jibryl’s anxiety, general psychopathology and impaired psychosocial function, all of which had developed as a consequence of his chronic anxiety and depression, had left him in an angry, irritable, disenfranchised and vulnerable state at the time of his offending. He described Jibryl’s prospects of being successfully rehabilitated as “moderate” [253] .
	
	
	The report of Mr Ahmad, which was prepared on 20 August 2014, was the result of a referral from a Dr Hassan. On the basis of the information provided to him, Mr Ahmad identified a number of “diagnostic possibilities” including schizophrenia, a major depressive disorder, schizoaffective disorder, social phobia, paranoid personality disorder and schizotypal personality disorder [254] .
	
	
	Dr Emder examined Jibryl following referral from his general practitioner in November 2009 when he was 16 years of age. He described Jibryl as a person who had “some problems with his growth and also significant psychological difficulty” [255] . His said that Jibryl had recently been commenced on Zoloft (an anti-depressant) and was suffering from low self-esteem, partly because of his short stature [256] .
	
	
	The academic records which were tendered establish that Jibryl was assessed as “competent” in his TAFE studies [257] . His school reports were generally positive [258] .
	
	
	On 25 September 2017 Jibryl’s solicitor wrote to the Commissioner for Corrective Services seeking admission to the PRISM program [259] . On 28 September 2017 he was advised that no specific information regarding Jibryl’s request could be provided. It was recommended that Jibryl express his interest in being included in the program to prison staff. It was also pointed out that all inmates were eligible to engage with psychological and counselling support services, both of which could assist in supporting Jibryl’s “stated interest in commencing the process of disengagement” [260] . As previously noted [261] , Mr Piazza gave evidence that “technically” entry into the PRISM program is not available until the latter stages of a sentence.
	
	
	The testimonial material variously described Jibryl as well-mannered, kind and well behaved. The authors of a number of the testimonials confirmed the adverse effect upon Jibryl of the separation and divorce of his parents. A number of them also included statements to the effect that with proper guidance, Jibryl’s prospects of rehabilitation were favourable.
	


THE NATURE AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF JIBRYL’S OFFENDING

Submissions on behalf of the Crown


	
	In terms of the general nature of the conspiracy, and the approach to be adopted in sentencing in such cases, the Crown relied on the submissions made in the case against Khalid. In terms of matters specific to Jibryl, the Crown submitted that he too had occupied a position of seniority, albeit at a level under that of Khalid. The Crown pointed, in particular, to:
	



	
	Jibryl’s possession of three functional firearms and a large amount of ammunition;
	
	
	his authorship of the “Torn Up Motorbike Document” which contained images and coded descriptions of three firearms; and
	
	
	his authorship of the “We will break the ice here in Aus” document, in which he spoke about the Lindt Café siege and in which stated that “the time is NOW!!!”, a reference, the Crown submitted, to what Jibryl saw as the importance of an immediate terrorist attack.
	


Submissions on behalf of Jibryl


	
	Mr Temby QC, who appeared on behalf of Jibryl, emphasised that Jibryl had not come under investigation until November 2014 and that his involvement in the conspiracy had not commenced until some time after 7 December 2014. He submitted that his contact with the other co-conspirators was limited to contact with Khalid which had first occurred on 7 December 2014, and that the content of the conversation on that day was consistent with Jibryl having not interacted with Khalid for a lengthy period of time. It was submitted that in these circumstances, not only was the period of the conspiracy short, Jibryl’s involvement was even shorter.
	
	
	It was submitted that there was no evidence that Jibryl had agreed to any nominated target. In terms of specific parts of the statement of facts, it was submitted that the conversation with Khalid on 16 December 2014 did not encompass discussions about martyrdom or planning for a terrorist attack [262] , and that the evidence did not establish that Jibryl had attended the meeting at Khalid’s premises during 17 and 18 December 2014 [263] .
	
	
	Senior counsel took particular issue with the Crown’s submission that Jibryl occupied a position “high up” in the conspiracy, and submitted that Jibryl was properly described as a “late joiner” [264] . It was submitted that in circumstances where the evidence established that Jibryl had had little, if any, contact with Khalid for a considerable period of time prior to December 2014, the conclusion urged by the Crown that Jibryl occupied a senior role in the conspiracy could not be made out [265] .
	
	
	Finally, to the extent that the Crown relied on references to a “wedding” as being a form of code, senior counsel pointed to the evidence that Jibryl was in fact engaged to be married on two separate occasions, and that neither marriage eventuated. It was submitted that in these circumstances any reference by Jibryl to a “wedding” [266]  was legitimate and not coded.
	


Submissions on behalf of the Crown in reply


	
	The Crown submitted in reply that the objective seriousness of Jibryl’s offending was reflected, at least in part, in the nature of what was being considered in terms of a terrorist act. The Crown again acknowledged that no particular target had been identified, but submitted that the broad nature of appropriate targets was clearly being discussed, in the context of the use of firearms. The Crown also pointed to the fact that in conversations between Khalid and IM, and in one or more of the documents, the killing of police, and martyrdom, were both discussed, and that this reflected the objective seriousness of the offending.
	
	
	The Crown accepted that the earliest contact between Jibryl and Khalid had occurred on 7 December 2014. However, the Crown submitted that this did not alter the fact that Jibryl occupied a high position in the conspiracy, and that what had been done in the period in which he was involved was significant. The Crown pointed, in particular, to the fact that Jibryl had possession of firearms and ammunition, and was the author of two separate documents. It was submitted that the inference to be drawn from Jibryl’s actions was that he was encouraging the discussion of what act(s) might be taken in pursuit of the conspiracy. In all of these circumstances, the Crown submitted that individual factors such as whether Jibryl had engaged in the use of particular coded language, or whether he attended the meeting at Khalid’s premises on 17/18 December 2014, were of little significance.
	


Consideration


	
	One of the principal submissions advanced on behalf of Jibryl was that the nature and circumstances of his offending were less serious on account of the fact that the conspiracy itself was short, and that Jibryl’s involvement was even shorter. It was submitted, in effect, that these (and other) factors supported a conclusion that the objective seriousness of Jibryl’s offending was substantially lower than that of Khalid. As I have already observed in dealing with Khalid’s case, the duration of the conspiracy is an obviously relevant factor, although not the only one.
	
	
	I accept the submission advanced on Jibryl’s behalf that he is properly described as a “late joiner”. I also accept that prior to joining the conspiracy, Jibryl had had little (if any) contact with Khalid. I also accept that evidence falls short of establishing that he attended the meeting at Khalid’s premises on 17/18 December 2014. However, there are other factors relevant to a determination of the nature, circumstances and objective seriousness of Jibryl’s offending.
	
	
	Like Khalid, Jibryl’s offending was supported by an unequivocal adherence to violent ideology. The strength of that adherence is demonstrated by the very fact of Jibryl’s offending, as well as by his plea. Given the object of the conspiracy, any comment about the significance of Jibryl’s possession of firearms and ammunition would be superfluous.
	
	
	Moreover, Jibryl was responsible for writing two documents. The “Torn Up Motorbike Document” was heavily coded in its references to firearms and reflected a considerable degree of planning and premeditation. It was obviously directed towards the fundamental consideration of what firearms would be required in order to carry out the type of attack which was being contemplated.
	
	
	The “We will break the ice hear in AUS” document was even more significant. In referring to the fact that surveillance may have been increased as a consequence of the Lindt Café siege, Jibryl stated that “the earlier we do things the better” [267] . Having referred to members of the Australian military forces fighting overseas as “pigs”, he exclaimed that “the time is NOW!!!” before stating that “we are going to do our own things and we will break the Ice here in AUS” and that, as a consequence, “everything will start here” [268] . I am satisfied that those various statements were references to the attack which was being contemplated and that Jibryl saw a need to commit such an attack sooner rather than later. So much is clear from the language that he adopted. Like Khalid, Jibryl does not stand to be sentenced as though he committed the acts about which he wrote and which were obviously being contemplated. Equally however, such acts necessarily inform the nature and gravity of his offending.
	
	
	Jibryl told Dr Furst that he was “angry” at the time, and “a bit naïve”, and that it was “just a piece of paper”. For the reasons I have already expressed, such statements are deserving of little weight in the absence of sworn evidence. Moreover, they seriously understate the seriousness of Jibryl’s offending. What Jibryl wrote in those documents would instil fear and trepidation in any person who read it. In my view, his authorship of them reflects an unequivocal commitment to violent jihad, and an equally unequivocal commitment to the conspiracy of which he was an admitted part.
	
	
	Further, I am unable to accept the submission that Jibryl’s first conversation with Khalid on 16 December 2014, and in particular his reference to “getting married”, should be construed as an innocent reference to his own personal situation. The conversation must be viewed in the context of that which immediately followed it, which was heavily coded in an obvious attempt to obscure the fact that what was being discussed was firearms.
	
	
	For all of these reasons Jibryl’s offending was of considerable objective seriousness. It falls towards the upper end of the scale, although it is slightly lower than that of Khalid. That said, and like Khalid, Jibryl was also a committed terrorist, and similarly corrupted by the ideology to which he adhered. Once again, considerations of general deterrence assume considerable importance in determining an appropriate sentence.
	


JIBRYL’S SUBJECTIVE CASE

Submissions on behalf of the Crown


	
	The Crown acknowledged Jibryl’s plea but pointed out that it had been entered at a late stage. As with Khalid, the Crown did not suggest that the plea was not deserving of some discount, but submitted that any discount should be at the lower end of the scale.
	


Submissions on behalf of Jibryl


	
	Senior counsel emphasised that Jibryl had no criminal history and was therefore to be sentenced as a person of prior good character. Whilst accepting that subjective considerations generally played a lesser role on sentence given the nature of this kind of offending, senior counsel highlighted a number of factors which, he submitted, should be taken into account.
	
	
	It was submitted that the evidence established that Jibryl had not previously displayed any tendency towards violence, and that his conduct in custody had been exemplary, productive and co-operative. It was further submitted that a positive feature of Jibryl’s subjective case was the fact that he has been recorded as seeking, and being granted access to, “moderate” Islamic religious material, and had been engaging with Islamic clergy. It was submitted that these factors along with his plea of guilty, the accompanying acknowledgement of wrongdoing, and his relative youth, supported a conclusion that his prospects of rehabilitation were generally favourable. Senior counsel acknowledged that there was no evidence from Jibryl himself regarding the renunciation of any previously held extremist ideology, but submitted that the other factors relied upon were generally supportive of him. It was submitted that any period of imprisonment to be imposed would see Jibryl emerge as an older and wiser person, who was strongly disinclined to follow any path of violence.
	


Submissions on behalf of the Crown in reply


	
	The Crown emphasised that the nature of Jibryl’s offending carried with it an adherence to the cause of violent jihad. Whilst accepting that Jibryl’s plea of guilty could be seen as some step towards the abandonment of such a cause, the Crown submitted that the onus of establishing that fact was firmly upon an offender, such that the best evidence of abandonment would necessarily be from Jibryl himself. The Crown submitted that at its highest, the plea of guilty, the inquiry about the PRISM Program and Jibryl’s behaviour in custody, may support a conclusion that he may be willing to step away from the ideology.
	


Consideration


	
	As with all offenders, Jibryl’s subjective case is to be considered by reference to applicable provisions of s. 16A(2) of the Act along with any other identified factors which are relevant.
	


The plea of guilty: s. 16A(2)(g)


	
	Jibryl entered a plea of guilty to the conspiracy offence on 31 July 2017 which was the day fixed for his trial. He pleaded guilty to offences contrary to the FA on 3 October 2017. I have previously set out those authorities which bear upon the assessment of the discount in respect of a plea of guilty in the case of a Federal offender [269] .
	
	
	To the extent that I am required to apply a discount in respect of the offences contrary to the FA, the applicable range to reflect the utilitarian value of the pleas is 10%-25%, the timing of the pleas being the predominant consideration [270] .
	
	
	Taking all of those circumstances into account, the appropriate discount in the case of each of Jibryl’s pleas of guilty is 10%.
	


Personal deterrence: s. 16A(2)(j)


	
	I have dealt with the issue of Jibryl’s prospects of rehabilitation below. There are some favourable aspects, although there remains a need for any sentence to reflect considerations of personal deterrence.
	


Character, antecedents, age, means and physical or mental condition: s. 16A(2)(m)


	
	Jibryl is now 24 years of age and was 21 at the time of the offending. He has no previous criminal history and the testimonials speak highly of him. I have taken those factors into account.
	
	
	I have already set out the principles governing the sentencing of youthful offenders [271] . I attach little weight to Jibryl’s self-serving assessment to Dr Furst that he was naïve. His offending reflected considerable planning, and involved the possession of firearms and ammunition. There is no evidence that he was suffering from any degree of cognitive or psychological immaturity which contributed to his offending, the objective seriousness of which I have concluded was in the upper range. Such offending was committed when Jibryl was substantially over the age of maturity. Further, whilst Dr Furst diagnosed Jibryl as suffering from a number of disorders, he was clearly of the opinion there was no direct correlation, or causative link, between any of those disorders and the offending. In all of the circumstances, and for the reasons expressed in Khalid’s case, Jibryl’s youth is deserving of little weight on sentence.
	


Contrition: s. 16A(2)(f)

The prospect of rehabilitation: s. 16A(2)(n)


	
	Jibryl expressed “regret” for his actions to Dr Furst. For the reasons expressed when dealing with Khalid’s case, statements of that nature are of limited weight in the absence of sworn evidence [272] .
	
	
	In terms of his prospects of rehabilitation, I have already canvassed the effect, in a matter such as this, of the absence of any sworn evidence renouncing a previous adherence to violent ideology [273] . Those observations apply equally in Jibryl’s case. Jibryl’s plea of guilty and the fact that he has obviously used his time in custody productively by (inter alia) gaining employment, are factors which operate in his favour. They point tentatively towards a conclusion that his prospects of rehabilitation are more favourable than not, although for the reasons I have already expressed when dealing with Khalid’s case, any such prediction must be expressed with a considerable degree of caution in the absence of sworn evidence.
	


Other factors


	
	I have made reference to Jibryl’s conditions of custody which are obviously harsh. I have taken those conditions into account in the manner previously expressed [274] .
	
	
	Jibryl has been in custody since 10 December 2014 [275] . Any sentence imposed should commence on that date.

THE EVIDENCE TENDERED BY THE CROWN

The facts


	
	The statement of facts tendered by the Crown against IM was in the following terms [291] :
	


A.   Ideology

1.   “IM” (“the offender”), Sulayman Khalid and Jibryl Almaouie (together, “the conspirators”) adhere to the religious ideology of violent jihad. Specifically, they adhere to the religious ideology of Wahhabi-Salafism. This is the ideology that inspires ISIS (the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria), Al-Qaeda and like‑minded groups and their supporters. [292] 

2.   The cause that was to be advanced in the proposed terrorist act or acts was that of violent jihad. The essential feature of the cause, which the conspirators believed to be a religious obligation, was to engage in violence to advance what they considered to be the interests of Islam. They believed Islam to be under attack from various Western countries, in Syria and the Middle East, and also in Australia. They also believed that those who died pursuing violent jihad were martyrs, who would be rewarded in paradise.

3.   During the conspiracy period (that is, between about 7 November 2014 and 18 December 2014), each of the conspirators was committed to Islam and they often spoke about it and included it in their daily lives. Whilst the word “jihad” is used and understood amongst the wider Muslim community to mean “spiritual struggle”, the conspirators used the term (and possessed material that used the term) to mean “violent jihad”.

4.   During the period of the conspiracy and for some time before, Khalid was active in seeking to advance Islam. He had actively proselytized for Islam in the street and posted videos of those activities online. His activity was known to his friends, including (amongst others) the offender, who had a video on his phone of Khalid preaching Islam in the street.

5.   Khalid had publicly displayed his support for the violent jihad espoused by ISIS. One way he did so was by obtaining and wearing clothing with badges and adornments of ISIS. When police executed a search warrant at his premises on 18 December 2014, the items they found included clothing bearing identifiable ISIS markings and a series of printed A4 sheets which, when placed together, formed an almost complete ISIS banner. Furthermore, Khalid had appeared on the “Insight Program”, which was televised nationally, and supported the violent jihadi ideology of ISIS.

6.   Khalid had also made a YouTube video which he had posted on the internet, titled “A Direct Message to the Secret Services, A call to Taweed, Millatu Ibrahim”. In that video, which features an ISIS emblem, Khalid makes a thinly veiled threat against various Western security services, including those of Australia. The video was one of 25 published online by Khalid between 25 May 2013 and 7 December 2014, the majority of which show Khalid preaching and discussing Islam.

7.   Khalid was also the conspirator who sent religious advice and sayings to the other conspirators. He had many telephone communications with the offender, during which they spoke about martyrdom and committing some form of terrorist act. The urgency with which the offender longed to commit a terrorist act and become a martyr is clear from those communications.

8.   On 18 December 2014, when the offender’s telephone was seized under warrant executed at his home at 67 Denman Road Georges Hall, it was found to contain the following extremist material:

a)   Violent jihad images, including stills of a beheading and images and documents in praise of mujahedeen [293]  and jihad;

b)   Images of ISIS banners, weapons and persons giving the ISIS finger salute;

c)   Many images of the offender giving the same salute, including an image of the offender with Khalid and another person all giving the salute; and

d)   An image from Khalid’s “Direct Message to the Secret Services” and a video of Khalid preaching in the streets.

9.   Also during the search of the offender’s premises on 18 December 2014, he was found to have the following material which was seized:

a)   Six CDs titled “Lives of the prophets”;

b)   Eleven CDs labelled “Anwar Al-Awlaki” (a jihadist cleric);

c)   Three CDs labelled “ways and means of devil”, “The plot of the hypocrites” [294]  and “Arabic/Syrian Anasheed [295] ”;

d)   One hand written document entitled “Lover of Jihad”; and

e)   Document titled “the blood of the Shuhada”. [296] 

B.   Outline of the conspiracy [297] 

…

24.   By his close association with Khalid, their talk of joint martyrdom, his strong urging that a terrorist act be done here in Australia and his sourcing of firearms, IM had a high role in the conspiracy.

ARREST AND CHARGING

92.   On 10 December 2015, Khalid, the offender, Jibryl Almaouie, and Ghazzawy were arrested and charged. Mohamed Al Maouie was arrested on 23 December 2015. Farhad Said was arrested on 26 May 2016. Each was provided with their legal rights under Part 1C of the Crimes Act 1914 and declined to participate in a record of interview.

93.   The offender was in custody from 10 December 2015 to 14 January 2016 (a total of 35 days), when he was released on conditional bail by Adams J. The offender was again taken into custody on 31 July 2017 following his plea of guilty.

IM’s criminal history


	
	IM’s criminal history contains an entry arising from his appearance at the Parramatta Children’s Court on 26 August 2015 in respect of counts of possessing an unauthorised firearm. Each of those charges was dealt with pursuant to s. 33(1)(b) of the CCPA. The firearms which were the subject of those charges are the same firearms to which reference is made in the facts tendered [303] .
	


The report of Ms Arnold


	
	Ms Arnold is an Assistant Manager at the Juvenile Justice Centre at which IM is presently held. IM has a custodial classification based upon the serious nature of the charge to which he has pleaded guilty, and what is viewed as his possible risk level. As a result, he is unable to mix with any other detainee who is charged with a similar offence. The risk he is considered to pose is monitored in a number of ways including by conducting background and intelligence checks on all of those who visit him, monitoring his phone calls, monitoring all incoming and outgoing mail and checking any books and other written material provided to him by any family member or associate.
	
	
	He has been placed in a single room with a television, desk and his own amenities. The unit in which he is housed has a number of recreational facilities. His able to make telephone calls to his legal representative on any day of the week and is permitted to have legal conferences with the same frequency. He currently has 21 approved visitors, all of whom are members of his immediate or extended family. He has 7 telephone numbers approved for contact [304] .
	
	
	IM is seen regularly by Justice Health for an asthma condition and is able to consult health services as and when the need arises. He has access to all the general amenities of the centre in which he is housed although due to his classification he is only able to access programs which are designated “low risk” [305] .
	
	
	Ms Arnold stated that IM was generally very polite and well-mannered towards staff [306] . She described him as an intelligent young person who interacted well with others. His behaviour is managed through the Detainee Incentive Scheme, a program which rewards positive behaviour with incentives. He has achieved 5 out of 7 incentives since being taken into custody and has progressed to stage 2 of the program which gives him greater access to amenities [307] . However Ms Arnold did say that at times IM had displayed anti-social behaviour and a disregard for the rules and practices of the centre, as a consequence of which he had been issued with two reports for poor behaviour [308] . That said, she stated that IM had not been involved in any serious incidents since being taken into custody [309] .
	


The report of Juvenile Justice


	
	The report of Juvenile Justice set out IM’s background, the terms of which were generally consistent with what appeared in the various medical reports. The report stated that IM had identified negative peer associations, lack of consequential thinking, and immaturity as being factors that had contributed to his offending [310] . IM said that as he started to become acquainted with his co-offenders, he enjoyed their company and that in light of the fact that he had been a victim of bullying at school, he looked up to them because he felt safe and important. The report went on to state [311] :
	


(IM) reports that due to his young age and immaturity, he was not aware that his actions at the time were wrong nor did he understand the legal consequences and the extent of his engagement in the offending behaviours. (IM) stated he was focused on pleasing his peers and gave little thought to the outcome. (IM) identified that over time his role in the offence increased and he had concerns about the depth of discussion but did not know how to extricate himself from the situation.


	
	The report noted that IM was working closely with a psychologist in custody who had reported that he engaged well with counselling, and that he had focused upon his mental health and coping strategies [312] . In terms of IM’s attitude and beliefs, the report stated the following [313] :
	


Throughout his assessment, (IM) denied he was a supporter of ISIS or any acts of terrorism. (IM) stated that he does not want to die young and leave his family behind.

In relation to today’s matter, (IM) highlighted the importance for him to fit in with his peers at the time of the offence. (IM) stated that after his arrest, he felt that his co-offenders had used him due to his young age and immaturity. (IM) accepted responsibility for his part in the offence and considers his involvement is serious.

THE EVIDENCE RELIED UPON BY IM


	
	Dr Woods interviewed IM on 25 September 2017. For the purposes of his assessment he was provided with a number of documents including the facts tendered by the Crown (although not, it seems, the telephone intercept material). Under the heading “Executive Summary” Dr Woods said the following [314] :
	


Assessment of (IM) has revealed he was in all “forensic” probability been (sic) targeted and groomed by the co-accused Sulayman Khalid; he was aged approximately fourteen (14) years at the time of being “groomed”.

Offender-Offence Linkage analysis has identified the following highly relevant factors:-

• (IM) aged fourteen (14 years) at the time of meeting the co-accused, Sulayman Khalid, was socially and emotionally isolated.

• Executive Functioning is only beginning to develop in early teens and does not generally reach full development in males until (approximately) early to mid twenties.

• (IM) appears to have been targeted and groomed by Mr Khalid.

Based on a nature of (IM’s) disclosures regarding his behaviour that is the subject of the matter that brings him before the Court and noting his actions subsequent to Mr Khalid’s arrest, I believe there is good forensic reason to believe that he (IM) was largely engaging in adolescent fantasy at all material times and arising from this gain (sic) a vicarious level of excitement.


	
	Dr Woods said that IM “was never fully radicalised” and “that he now rejects such values” [315] . He expressly disagreed with the opinions of Dr Tong and Dr Jones that IM suffered from a significant level of cognitive impairment. He said, in particular [316] :
	


The extent to which (IM) was “genuinely radicalised” as opposed to engaging in fantasy based hero like behaviour is questionable. In my opinion and having regard for a) (IM’s) various disclosures and b) the speed at which he ceased all association with the co-accused and re-aligned himself with non-radicalised persons and organisations, I believe he was never genuinely radicalised.


	
	Dr Woods made reference to IM’s reported history of having been bullied and socially isolated in primary school [317] . He said that “fantasy based hero like behaviour” by young adolescents was not unusual, but was more likely to occur when the person in question did not enjoy broad peer based social acceptance, leading to a fragile “sense of self”. Dr Woods went on to say [318] :
	


Based upon (IM’s) disclosures regarding a) the circumstances in which he met Mr. Khalid and other similarly slightly older young males, b) needs/desire for acceptance, c) the perceived increased social status, c) (sic) the increasing level of interest shown in him by the group of slightly older males and d) his lack of Arabic language skills and thus reliance on Mr Khalid to translate and interpret passages of the Quran, it appears highly probable that he (IM) had been “targeted” and was being “groomed”.

When challenged as to why he continued to maintain contact with the group after (eventually) becoming concerned about the possibility that a terrorist attack (as opposed to what he had initially viewed in terms of “just talking shit”) (IM) stated that he felt “trapped”.


	
	Dr Woods concluded that IM’s responses to testing were consistent with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder [319] . He said that IM had progressed in his rehabilitation and that continued detention represented the primary risk to IM’s long term mental health and successful rehabilitation [320] .
	
	
	Dr Tong examined IM on 31 August 2017. The history given to Dr Tong by IM included the following [321] :
	


I met those people at the Mosque. I regret everything I done and now I know it was wrong. I was charged with firearms offences. I took a picture of my uncle’s hunting gun. The Court says it didn’t happen. I was not going to do anything either way. I never thought anyone was going to do anything. I knew for sure I wasn’t going to do anything. I thought I was only talking about what was happening overseas, not here. I was being bullied at school and those people accepted me into their group. They were all older than me, all (aged) 18 and over.

I never thought of the danger. It was a long time ago. I know about that “talk” because it’s in the (legal) brief about a terrorist act here but … it’s not here, its overseas, that’s where the war is. I know nothing about it. I heard about the news overseas. They wanted to do an attack. I never thought it was serious. I thought they were talking like crap. I did say stuff. I just wanted to fit in. I thought it was a joke and I didn’t know I was doing anything wrong.


	
	Dr Tong noted that IM’s clinical presentation did not exhibit symptoms suggestive of irrationality, agitation or psychomotor retardation [322] . She found, based on IM’s responses to testing, that he was functioning within the borderline range of cognitive capacity [323] , and concluded that he suffered from impaired cognitive and social maturity [324] .
	
	
	Dr Jones assessed IM over a period of three days on 14, 15 and 17 November 2016. He concluded that IM was suffering from a major depressive disorder of a moderate severity [325] . He concluded that whilst IM exhibited some deficiency in conceptual and cognitive functioning, he was not suffering from any intellectual disability. He also said that IM’s depressive disorder was likely to have manifested itself as a result of the alleged offending, the current proceedings and the inevitable social ramifications, both for himself and his family [326] .
	
	
	Dr Allnutt assessed IM on 21 August 2017. The history taken by Dr Allnutt included references to the telephone intercept material. IM told Dr Allnutt that he thought his interaction with Khalid was “weird”. He said, in effect, that he did not think that Khalid meant what was being discussed in at least some of their conversations. In terms of his association with firearms, IM told Dr Allnutt that he had photos taken of himself with a gun to “show off”  [327] . Dr Allnutt thought that IM manifested “a constellation of anxiety and depressive symptoms” [328]  and that differential diagnoses would include chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and a Panic Disorder. Dr Allnutt formed the impression that IM’s involvement in the offending had emerged in the context of a relationship with older males, when he was emotionally vulnerable and felt a need for a sense of belonging, identity and personal validation. He concluded [329] :
	


…based on his account, his involvement in the planning and preparation was naïve, he would have been vulnerable to having a naïve view, given his age.


	
	Dr Allnutt went on to say [330] :
	


At the time I saw your client he expressed remorse regarding his offending. He said he had stopped associating with his co-accused or people who maintained the ideology. He regarded himself (sic) relatively innocent participant in the offending behaviour at the time, on the one hand, but at the same time, now appreciates the seriousness of his offending.


	
	IM’s mother said that her separation from her husband had had a negative effect upon IM [331]  and that his arrest for this offence had rendered him quieter than was previously the case [332] . She expressed a belief that IM “just fell under the spell of the other adults in this case” (who) “made him feel accepted and loved” [333] . She placed the blame for IM’s current predicament upon herself, expressing a belief that her separation from her husband had made IM feel vulnerable [334] . She described the circumstances arising from the current proceedings as being “a nightmare for (her) family” [335] .
	
	
	IM’s father said that his separation “took a toll” on IM, as a consequence of which IM had become withdrawn [336] . He too sought to place blame upon himself, and described the present circumstances as having “rocked (his) family profoundly” [337] . He said IM was “only a kid” who “certainly would not have entertained the thoughts of the conspirators had he been older and more mature”, describing him as a “really a gentle boy who wouldn’t harm a fly” [338] .
	
	
	The medical records pertaining to IM’s parents confirm that the mental health of IM’s mother has been adversely affected as a consequence of the stress and anxiety arising from IM’s current circumstances [339] . The records pertaining to IM’s father confirm that he is also suffering from medical issues. However, they are of a different nature to those being suffered by IM’s mother, and do not appear to be causally related to IM’s current circumstances.
	
	
	The testimonials tendered on IM’s behalf variously described him as honest, quiet and kind, and a person in respect of whom the present offending was uncharacteristic. All of those providing testimonials expressed their ongoing support.
	


THE NATURE AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF IM’S OFFENDING

Submissions of behalf of the Crown


	
	In terms of the general nature of the conspiracy and its objective seriousness, the Crown relied on the submissions made in respect of Khalid and Jibryl. Specifically in terms of IM, the Crown submitted that he too occupied a high role in the group. The Crown emphasised that IM was a strong adherent of jihadist ideology, as evidenced by his participation in the offending. The Crown also pointed to the fact that in the course of recorded conversations with Khalid, IM had often expressed a strong desire to engage in a terrorist attack and become a martyr. The Crown also emphasised that in those same conversations, IM often spoke about weapons in a coded form.
	
	
	The Crown also emphasised that as part of his role in the conspiracy, IM had sourced four firearms from his uncle’s premises and had sent photographs of himself posing with the firearms to Khalid. This, it was submitted, highlighted the significant role that IM had played.
	


Submissions on behalf of the offender


	
	Mr James QC, who appeared on behalf of IM, accepted that the facts tendered by the Crown set out the extent of the conspiracy, and the role played by IM. However, he emphasised that IM was 14 years and 11 weeks old at the commencement of the conspiracy and submitted that his involvement in the group should be viewed as “apparently as an active disciple of Khalid” who, when told that IM sought to go to Syria to fight, had urged him to stay in Australia and perform a terrorist act in this country. He described IM’s offending as a “burst of 14 year old enthusiasm”.
	
	
	Senior counsel took issue with the Crown’s submission that IM’s role was a prominent one. He submitted that the use of such an all-encompassing approach had the tendency to obscure a proper assessment and appreciation of the actual role which IM had played. Whilst accepting that the offending was objectively serious, senior counsel submitted that the period of conspiracy was short, and that there was no basis on which to assert that IM had played an “adult” or primary role. He submitted that IM was obviously immature, and that there was an air of unreality about his participation. Whilst senior counsel did not suggest that IM’s offending was other than serious, he submitted that the act of participating in a conspiracy was not as culpable, nor as objectively serious, as committing a completed offence. This, it was submitted, was particularly so where the agreement did not extend beyond planning, and where there was no specific terrorist act in mind.
	
	
	It was submitted that it was not IM’s primary focus to commit any terrorist act in Australia, but rather to go and fight in Syria, and that his expressions of “enthusiasm” were illustrative of how a young person could be recruited and radicalised. It was submitted that IM was a child, in respect of whom sentencing principles in respect of young persons were applicable.
	
	
	It was submitted that when determining IM’s objective criminality, I should find that he was an “enthusiastic” 14 year old [340]  who was taking a religious stance at the insistence of, or at least amongst, others who were much older and much more influential. Senior counsel went so far as to say that I should find that IM was “recruited” by Khalid into joining the conspiracy and remained under his influence thereafter, seemingly envisaging himself as some kind of religious hero who was able to obtain martyrdom [341] . He submitted that I should find that IM entered the conspiracy as a “follower”, and had participated under the influence of others in circumstances where he was eager to obtain their acceptance. It was submitted that I should find that IM did not have a fixed state of mind concerning his own radicalisation, and that any apparent adherence to violent jihad was a creature of his youth, immaturity and the other influences on him.
	


Submissions on behalf of the Crown in reply


	
	The Crown did not take issue with the proposition there was some influence exercised by Khalid over IM. However, the Crown submitted that the evidence did not support a conclusion that IM had been “recruited or “groomed” by Khalid in the sense of being enticed into becoming involved [342] . It was submitted that the entirety of the evidence, and particularly the telephone intercept material, reflecte",2017-11-02 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court

	On 17 November 2015 this Court (constituted by Ward JA, Adams and Bellew JJ) heard an appeal against both conviction and sentence filed by the co-offender. In the judgment delivered on 14 April 2016 the Court dismissed the appeal against conviction, but upheld the appeal against sentence: Sorensen v R [2016] NSWCCA 54.
	
	
	The offender Sorensen was resentenced by the Court. Ward JA concluded:
	


“Taking into account those [objective and subjective] matters, the respective maximum penalties and, as to count 3, the standard non-parole period, as well as the principle of totality, and applying, as the primary judge did, a high degree of concurrency, I propose the following indicative sentences:

on count 2, 3 years’ imprisonment;

on count 3, 3 years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years, 3 months;

on count 4, 2 years’ imprisonment;

on count 5, 8 years’ imprisonment,

aggregated to an overall sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment commencing on 24 May 2013 with a non-parole period of 7 years expiring on 23 May 2020.”


	
	In light of that decision, the applicant now seeks leave pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) to appeal (significantly out of time) against the sentence imposed upon him. The proposed ground 1 mirrors the ground of appeal (being ground 2A) accepted as having been made out with respect to Mr Sorensen; ground 2 is in the alternative. The grounds advanced are:
	



	
	“In sentencing the appellant [sic], the learned trial judge erred in taking into account the vigilante nature of the offence as an aggravating factor because an element of the offence charged pursuant to s 86(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) was “to obtain gratification by punishing and humiliating” the complainant.
	
	
	In the alternative to Ground 5 [sic – ground 1], the parity principle requires the appellant [sic] to be resentenced having regard to the Court of Criminal Appeal’s re-exercise of the sentencing discretion in relation to the appellant’s [sic] co-accused, Mr Sorensen in Sorensen v R [2016] NSWCCA 54”
	


The Crown Case on Sentence


	
	Both the applicant and the respondent Crown accept that the Crown case was accurately summarised by Ward JA (with Adams J and Bellew J agreeing) in Sorensen v R at [8]-[14]:
	


“[8]   On 5 April 2012, Ms L, with two other women (Raquel and Michelle), drove from Wollongong to the Pioneer Tavern in Penrith to meet Mr Hall (someone known to Raquel). (Neither Raquel or Michelle was called to give evidence at the trial.) When they left the Pioneer Tavern, they drove to a number of places including Mr Sorensen’s house (where the assaults against Ms L occurred) and Mr Hall’s house. (I interpose to note that Ms L gave evidence that at both those places she smoked some of the drug “ice” with Mr Hall.)

[9]   While the group was at Mr Hall’s house, one or more of the women tried to steal some jewellery that belonged to Mr Hall’s mother (Ms Turner). When they went back to Mr Sorensen’s house, the other two women told Mr Hall that Ms L had stolen the jewellery. It was the Crown case that, as a result of that allegation, Ms L was hit, punched, forced to remove her clothes, touched around her breasts and her stomach, and told to lie on the floor and crawl around like a dog. Ms L gave evidence that a number of threats were made to her and that she feared for her life. She suffered a number of injuries.

[10]   At some point during the course of the assaults at Mr Sorensen’s house the other two women left. In the morning, Ms L was forced to drive to Ms Turner’s house where she was made to apologise for having stolen the jewellery. Mr Hall, Mr Sorensen and Ms L then went to a service station to put petrol in the car, at which point Ms L was able to make her escape.

[11]   The precise time line of the relevant events is not altogether clear.

[12]   Ms L gave evidence that she and the other two women left Wollongong at about 6pm on 4 April 2012; that it took around about 2 to 3 hours before they got to the Pioneer Tavern; and that they were still around the area of the Pioneer Tavern around 11-12 o’clock that night. After going to various places, including Mr Hall’s house where the jewellery was taken, the group ended up at Mr Sorensen’s house (for the second time that evening). Ms L’s evidence (consistent with what, according to the doctor who later examined Ms L in hospital, she reported after her escape) was that she was first assaulted at about 2.30am/3am. The visit to Ms Turner’s house was in the morning. There was some conflict in the evidence as to whether it was still dark when the three went to Ms Turner’s house. Ms Turner placed the visit as being at about 6.30-7am in the morning, which is consistent with the evidence of a woman who lived in a granny flat at the property (Ms Marshall). A visit at around that time is also consistent with the time at which a bystander (Ms Maybury) assisted to jump start Ms L’s car outside Ms Turner’s house before the group went to the service station and with the time at which the group ended up at Werrington service station and Mr Sorensen and Mr Hall were arrested.

[13]   The events at the service station occurred at about 7.45am. Mr Sorensen was arrested at that time. Ms L was taken to Nepean Hospital. According to the hospital records she presented for examination at the hospital at about 8.24am on 5 April 2012.

[14]   Ultimately, in the course of sentencing, the trial judge found that the period of detention was for some hours from some indeterminate time after midnight and concluding sometime after daylight on the day the arrests were recorded by the police.”


	
	The facts of the additional charge faced by the applicant were that he supplied the complainant with a small amount of methylamphetamine.
	
	
	The applicant’s criminal history was before the sentencing judge. It contained entries against the applicant commencing with a drink driving offence in 2001, when he was aged 17 years old. The applicant had convictions in 2004 for offences of possess implements to enter and drive conveyance, goods in custody, carry cutting weapon, take and drive conveyance without consent (2 counts), and drive manner dangerous. Fines and sentences of periodic detention were imposed, although the latter were varied on appeal to suspended sentences and community service orders. He was also dealt with in 2004 for malicious damage.
	
	
	In 2005 the applicant was called up for breaches of those community based sentences, and periods of imprisonment were imposed, the longest such sentence being one of 2 years imprisonment.
	
	
	He was also dealt with in that year for other driving offences, including driving whilst disqualified, an offence for which the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 3 months with a 3 year disqualification from driving. A further such charge later in the year attracted a sentence of 6 months imprisonment and a cumulative disqualification of 2 years.
	
	
	The applicant spent a month in prison in 2007 following his conviction for introducing a syringe to prison.
	
	
	In 2009 the applicant was sentenced for a 2007 offence of specially aggravated kidnapping, a term of 4 years and 3 months imprisonment being imposed upon him, with a NPP of 2 years and 3 months. That sentence took into account a number of other crimes, including aggravated break enter commit serious indictable offence, larceny, and take and drive without consent. The sentencing judgment relevant to those offences was part of the material before Craigie SC DCJ.
	
	
	In 2010 the applicant was charged with break enter steal, break enter with intent, and possess prohibited drug, receiving terms of imprisonment for those offences in 2011.
	
	
	The applicant’s Corrective Services history recorded numerous instances on which the applicant had been penalised for prison offences when in custody, including fighting, intimidation, and drug offences. After his admission to custody with respect to these offences the applicant incurred six such institutional charges.
	
	
	A pre-sentence report (“PSR”) that was before the Court noted that the 30 year old applicant had breached all periods of supervision by Community Corrections to which he had previously been subject, frequently as a result of drug use. The applicant reported problematic use of illicit drugs, having commenced drug use at age 17 with cocaine, ecstasy and methylamphetamine. The latter drug remained a problem for him. The applicant was diagnosed in 2005 with Rapid Cycling Bi-Polar Disorder; whilst in custody he was compliant with the medication regime prescribed him, but he ceased taking medication in the community, preferring to use illicit drugs. He asserted that he would take necessary medication in the future, and he had the support of his mother with that and other goals, such as employment.
	
	
	As to the offences, the applicant told the author of the PSR that he was innocent.
	
	
	Psychiatric and psychological reports were requested from Justice Health by the sentencing court. Professor David Greenburg conducted psychiatric examinations of the applicant in November 2013 and January 2014, providing two reports in which he concluded that the applicant suffered Bi-polar Disorder (being a provisional diagnosis) and a Poly-substance Dependence Disorder. At the time of his first examination of the applicant Professor Greenburg concluded that he was a mentally ill person within the meaning of Chapter 3 of the Mental Health Act 2007 (NSW); his condition had stabilised by the time of the second consultation and the applicant was no longer regarded as mentally ill.
	
	
	The forensic psychologist who assessed the applicant concluded that he fell within the medium – high risk category for recidivism.
	
	
	A victim impact statement from Ms L set out the terrible consequences for her as a result of the ordeal to which she was subjected.
	


The Applicant’s Case on Sentence


	
	The applicant relied upon a psychiatric report prepared for sentence by Dr Olav Nielssen, who saw him in December 2013. The applicant was in an acutely manic state at that time, with his speech grandiose and uninhibited. Like Professor Greenburg, Dr Nielssen concluded that the applicant had a Bi-polar Mood Disorder (then in a manic phase) and a Substance use Disorder. In a supplementary report of February 2014 (made after a review of documentation only) Dr Nielssen recorded the earlier instances on which the applicant had been psychiatrically assessed, and noted that the opinions expressed by treating medical staff were consistent with his own.
	
	
	The applicant did not give evidence on sentence.
	


The Conclusions of the Sentencing Judge


	
	In jointly sentencing the applicant and Sorensen his Honour set out the facts of the offending conduct consistent with the verdicts of guilty returned by the jury, and noted the additional charge against the applicant of supplying a prohibited drug, being methylamphetamine. His Honour concluded that the detention of Ms L commenced at some time after midnight, concluding when she made her escape and secured police assistance at about 7.45 am that same morning. He referred to R v Speechley (2012) 221 A Crim R and the factors relevant to be taken into account in a case involving kidnapping. His Honour said,
	


“The Court [in Speechley] held that offences pursuant to s 86 when committed as a form of vigilante action also require condemnation to reflect general deterrence on sentence. There are some aspects of that factor in the present matter. It was said that motivation of that type is capable of bearing in other ways on the determination of sentence.”


	
	The sentencing judge continued (after a reference to Barlow v R (2008) 6 A Crim R),
	


“In order to avoid any perception of double counting of the aggravating feature and the kidnapping it is necessary that much of the offending will, after individual assessment require recognition as very serious but also intimately related offending in the course of, an ongoing course of criminality. That will require consideration of whether a requisite degree of concurrence is to be applied. The formulation nonetheless leaves any assessment of totality in the criminality for both offenders, as very grave, albeit with a dominating concern to properly assess the totality of all the indictment counts within the frame work of the related and very serious offence of specially aggravated kidnapping” (ROS 16-17).


	
	He went on to detail the subjective cases of both offenders.
	
	
	The sentencing judge found that both the applicant and Sorensen had engaged in a grave course of criminality and had shown no remorse for the suffering inflicted on Ms L. He had regard to the principles of totality, and of parity, and to those matters referred to in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Of the applicant his Honour said,
	


“As to the offender Hall, although younger he was the initiator of the violence and of the gross humiliation heaped upon the victim. His persistence in the assaults and the level of brutality places him in an at least equally culpable position to that of his older and more criminally experienced offender. I have noted his recent and, I infer, past history of mental illness. As previously stated, I have not found any such mental illness to have been established as more probable than not, and present at the time of the offences” (ROS 33).


	
	Whilst the sentencing judge referred to the differing features of the respective cases for each offender, he concluded that the level of offending of each was of the same high order, notwithstanding some differentiation between the acts of each individual, and having regard to the fact that the offences were committed in furtherance of a joint criminal enterprise. He concluded,
	


“The outcome in distilling of all matters [including the additional charge for the applicant] is an effective parity between the two offenders’ sentences.”


	
	In considering count 5, the offence of specially aggravated kidnapping, the sentencing judge observed,
	


“I find that the detention came about as an act of quasi-vigilantism on the part of the offenders. I regard that as an aggravating circumstance.”

The Sentence Appeal


	
	In his sentence appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal Sorensen complained that the sentencing judge was in error in finding that the “quasi-vigilantism” was an aggravating feature, and in making that finding when an element of the offence of specially aggravated kidnapping was “to obtain gratification by punishing and humiliating” Ms L. The applicant seeks to make the same complaint, relying alternatively on a parity argument to contend for a reduction in sentence.
	
	
	The Crown accepts that the conclusions of this Court in Sorensen v R provide a basis for the Court to grant the applicant leave to appeal, uphold his appeal, and resentence him. Having regard to the finding of the sentencing judge as to parity, the Crown submits that lesser indicative sentences are warranted with respect to counts 4 and 5, and a lesser aggregate sentence is warranted in law.
	


Consideration


	
	As the Crown has fairly conceded, the conclusions of this Court in Sorensen v R are such that the applicant should be granted an extension of time in which to bring his application, and be granted leave to appeal. His appeal should be upheld, and the sentence imposed in the District Court quashed.
	
	
	At [128] – [129] of Sorensen v R Ward JA said (with the agreement of Adams and Bellew JJ),
	


“However, having properly recognised the need to avoid double counting the aggravating factor of the quasi-vigilantism in relation to the other offences when considering the totality of the offending (that being overshadowed by the specially aggravated kidnapping) (see [105], [108] above), his Honour nevertheless expressly referred to quasi-vigilantism as an aggravating factor for the count 5 offence, when the aggravation itself formed part of the charge. Punishment and humiliation were necessary parts of the offence of specially aggravated kidnapping as pleaded on the indictment. It could not properly be regarded as an aggravating factor on sentencing for an offence of which it formed part.

Therefore, even though the extent to which and the manner in which that factor was taken into account in determining the sentence for count 5 is not clear, I am of the opinion that his Honour erred in finding that the quasi-vigilante nature of the count 5 offence was an aggravating factor. Ground 2A is made out. In those circumstances it falls to this Court to re-sentence Mr Sorensen in line with the principles in Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; (2014) 252 CLR 601.”


	
	The same error was made with respect to the applicant.
	
	
	As a consequence of the error, it will be necessary to resentence him.
	
	
	On resentence, the applicant tendered a further report from Dr Nielssen dated 5 September 2017. The doctor took a history from the applicant in which he said of the offences, “someone took my mother’s jewellery and I have handled it the wrong way”. He referred to having been “in a bad place mentally” at the time as a consequence of a relationship breakdown, and to having been “all over the place” because of drug use.
	
	
	The applicant said that his condition now was much improved due to the effectiveness of the medication he had been taking. He felt that he had attained a level of maturity and “grown up”, and was now in a positive relationship, with employment prospects in his mother’s business. The applicant’s mother similarly told Dr Nielssen that the applicant had a new relationship and that it was anticipated that he would work in the family business upon release.
	
	
	The applicant referred to having completed an “aggression management course” in custody, and to be enrolled in “an addiction course”. The applicant had employment making furniture. His security classification had been reduced.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen confirmed his earlier diagnoses, although noted that the applicant’s bi-polar and substance use disorders were in remission. He thought that, as a result of consistent treatment in custody, the applicant’s future prospects were improved, although he cautioned that release to the community could “trigger an episode of mania”, as could illicit drug use, the risk of which remained. The doctor suggested that the applicant may benefit from treatment by long acting injectable medication, and close supervision on release.
	
	
	The applicant relies upon the report of Dr Nielssen to argue that this Court should impose a sentence “more benevolent” than that imposed upon Sorensen, if not in its term then in the ratio of sentence. Although no such argument was advanced in the written submissions in support of the application, the applicant submitted at the hearing of the matter that the supply offence for which the applicant alone was sentenced was not a particularly serious offence, and should not have operated so as to lead to the imposition of equivalent sentences as between the applicant and Sorensen, who had a longer criminal history than did he.
	
	
	As the applicant stated in his written submissions, and in arguing for reinstatement of parity, it was plain from the sentencing judgment of the District Court that “the applicant’s sentence was determined with express relativity to Sorensen’s”. Until oral arguments put at the hearing of the application, the applicant had not sought to take any issue with the approach to parity taken by the sentencing judge.
	
	
	For my part, I see no legitimate basis upon which to take a different approach to that taken to parity at first instance. There were differences in the cases of the two offenders, but not of such a nature as to require differentiation in sentence. Indeed, such a conclusion appears implicit in the applicant’s written submissions, wherein he submitted that “the Court should quash the applicant’s sentence and re-exercise the sentencing discretion having express regard to the fresh sentence imposed on Mr Sorensen”.
	
	
	Of Sorensen’s case Ward JA said, at [140] – [144],
	


“As to subjective matters, the pre-sentence report dated 5 December 2013 disclosed a history of an unstable upbringing as well as a lengthy history of criminal conduct. Mr Sorensen accepts that he has spent over half his life in custody. Significantly, at the time of the offence he was on parole for the offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm.

Mr Watson-Munro, a consultant forensic psychologist whose report was tendered on Mr Sorensen’s behalf at the sentencing hearing, concluded that Mr Sorensen had exhibited signs indicating he was suffering from major depression and was in remission from a poly-substance abuse disorder. His criminal history included a series of offences committed after having consumed illicit substances. It is apparent from the evidence that he is, as his Honour described him, a seasoned criminal and seasoned drug abuser.

Mr Watson-Munro recommended cognitive behavioural therapy to address and develop relapse prevention strategies in a number of areas in effect to provide Mr Sorensen with the basic skills for living in society as a normal citizen. Mr Watson-Munro also noted Mr Sorensen’s commitment to his partner and to his partner’s infant daughter.

Mr Sorensen had, as referred to earlier, provided a letter to the sentencing judge asserting his determination to cease using drugs and to use the motivation of a potential for a normal family life to strengthen his resolve to avoid further offending. There was, however, no expression of remorse for the suffering meted out to Ms L nor did Mr Sorensen accept his guilt. Mr Sorensen’s prior record and poor prospects of rehabilitation require a sentence that focusses on specific deterrence and community protection.

The sentencing judge considered that Mr Sorensen had a “glimmer of insight in him that he had wasted far too much of his life in custody as he now approached middle age, with looming powerful indications that he has become institutionalised” and thus he should be subjected to a longer period on parole “which, if productive, will be for the good of the community” and accordingly found special circumstances that justified a variation of the statutory formula in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I am sceptical that such special circumstances are present, there being little, if any evidence to justify a finding that there are significant positive signs which show that if Mr Sorensen is given a longer period on parole rehabilitation is likely to be successful, as opposed to being a mere possibility (R v Tuuta [2014] NSWCCA 40; (2014) 239 A Crim R 399 at [56]-[57]). However, the Crown did not in this Court submit that his Honour erred in this regard or that, in resentencing, no such finding should be made. In the circumstances I have slightly reduced the non-parole period from that which would follow from applying the s 44 formula.”


	
	Each offender had a criminal history, amongst which were convictions for violent offences similar to that before the Court. Each had offended whilst subject to conditional liberty. Each had a long history of illicit drug use. Each has mental health issues. The applicant is younger, and his criminal history is not quite as extensive but, as the sentencing judge observed,
	


“[…] although younger he was the initiator of the violence and the gross humiliation heaped on the victim.”


	
	The applicant additionally had a fifth charge for sentence, which reflected his offence of supplying a small amount of methylamphetamine to Ms L during the course of the relevant events. Whilst not a gravely serious example of such an offence, neither is it so trivial as to largely disregard it when considering parity, and resentence.
	
	
	Having regard to all of the relevant features of the respective cases of each, I would approach the re-sentencing exercise on the basis that the principle of equal justice requires the imposition of an equal sentence overall.
	
	
	I do not regard anything in Dr Nielssen’s report as altering that conclusion. Much of what Dr Nielssen reports is what was in turn reported to him by either the applicant or the applicant’s mother. This Court has repeatedly warned of the caution with which untested statements to third parties should be treated: R v Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353; (2001)127 A Crim R 369 at [58] – [59]; R v Imbornone [2017] NSWCCA 144 at [57]. Whilst I am prepared to accept that the applicant has hopes for a stable future on the basis of his new relationship and employment prospects, his past history would suggest that his prospects remain guarded.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen reports that the applicant is currently medicated, and his present intention is to remain compliant with any medication regime. There remains however, as pointed out by Dr Nielssen, a risk of relapse into illicit drug use, with the possible consequence of the applicant ceasing to take necessary medication. A return to a criminal lifestyle thus continues to be a possibility.
	
	
	These were extremely grave offences, as this Court concluded in Sorensen v R. A significant custodial penalty was required to serve the purposes of sentencing outlined in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Having regard to the principle of parity, and noting the requirements of totality, I would impose the same aggregate sentence of 10 years imprisonment upon the applicant as that imposed by this Court upon Sorensen. Taking into account the need for close supervision on release I would make a finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to permit a very modest extension to the NPP that would otherwise apply. The indicative sentences I propose are:
	



	
	count 1: imprisonment for 3 years;
	
	
	count 3: imprisonment for 3 years;
	
	
	count 4: imprisonment for 2 years;
	
	
	count 5: imprisonment for 8 years; and
	
	
	count 6 of the indictment of 25 September 2013: imprisonment for 2 years and 9 months.
	



	
	The orders, and sentence I propose are:
	



	
	Grant an extension of time until 23 June 2017 to file the notice of appeal against sentence.
	
	
	Grant leave to appeal against sentence.
	
	
	Appeal against sentence allowed.
	
	
	Sentence imposed in the District Court is quashed.
	
	
	In lieu thereof, Timothy Leigh Hall is sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 10 years, commencing on 16 December 2012 and expiring on 15 December 2022, with a non-parole period of 7 years to expire on 15 December 2019.

6364553,"R v Charbaji, Azam; Charbaji, Haysem; Jamieson, Lexy May (No 7) [2017] NSWSC 1518","JUDGMENT


	
	HIS HONOUR: The two murder accused, Azam and Haysem Charbaji (also referred to as “the Charbaji brothers”) have applied for the Court to discharge the jury under its discretion so to do to prevent a mistrial or an unfair trial. There would then need to be a second hearing, at least in relation to the Charbaji brothers.
	
	
	I refused that application, ex tempore, and reserved reasons. It was the original intention to provide full reasons but, given the passage of time, consider that these reasons will suffice and should be published without elaboration.
	
	
	The basis for the application is the Crown address to the jury on the evidence adduced in the trial. It is necessary to give some background.
	
	
	Azam and Haysem Charbaji are brothers. Each is charged with murder. Also on trial is Lexy Jamieson, who was charged with accessory.
	
	
	During the proceedings, evidence from CL and also recordings of Ms Jamieson were admitted only against Ms Jamieson. In the course of her address, the Crown Prosecutor relied on the statements of Ms Jamieson and the evidence of CL in the case against Azam and Haysem Charbaji.
	
	
	This was done in a number of ways which included using statements of Ms Jamieson, admitted only against her, to inculpate the Charbaji brothers and using the statements of Ms Jamieson and the evidence of CL to corroborate the evidence of Mr Gallo.
	
	
	Mr Gallo was a witness called in all three cases and whose evidence was admitted against each accused. He was a person involved, on his version peripherally, in the criminal conduct.
	
	
	Mr Gallo was the subject of significant cross-examination as to credit. If Mr Gallo were not to be believed or accepted, by the jury, the case against the Charbaji brothers becomes much weaker. I will be giving a direction that if Mr Gallo is not accepted beyond reasonable doubt the jury would be required to acquit all three of the accused.
	
	
	The applications to discharge, as against the Charbaji brothers is, as earlier stated, on the basis that the unfairness to the accused will result either in a mistrial or more accurately, a miscarriage of justice. Further, the accused submit that the damage has been done and a correction by the Crown or by the Court will not eliminate the miscarriage.
	
	
	The Court has enquired of the Crown, who opposes the application, as to whether she would correct these issues herself. The Crown prefers for the Court so to do.
	
	
	The alternative to a complete discharge is to continue the trial as against Ms Jamieson and order a new trial for the two other accused. In my view, if the trial cannot be salvaged against all of the accused, it would be inappropriate to continue against only Ms Jamieson.
	
	
	The reason it would be inappropriate is that the Court would need to explain to the jury why the proceedings were to continue in that way. Such an explanation would, almost of necessity, involve a criticism of the Crown, while the absence of an explanation would invite the jury to conjecture as to the reasons the Charbaji brothers were no longer before them.
	
	
	Absent an explanation, the jury would most probably assume either that one or other has changed his plea or that the Crown no longer considers them guilty. As a consequence, an explanation would be necessary and, in my view, prejudice either the Crown or the accused, Ms Jamieson.
	
	
	Ultimately, the Court is required to exercise its discretion as to the course to take. That discretion must be exercised judicially, bearing in mind my fundamental task to ensure a fair trial.
	
	
	If I were of the opinion that an appropriate direction from the Court could not be framed so as to undo the damage occasioned by the Crown address, I would discharge the jury. Inconvenience cannot supplant or overtake the necessity to avoid a miscarriage or irremediable prejudice to the accused.
	
	
	The accused are also concerned that any criticism of the Crown would be prejudicial to their clients. I will avoid any such criticism.
	
	
	Nevertheless, having given it some thought, I am of the view that an appropriate direction can issue that will overcome any prejudice. The direction will be on the record as are the terms of the Crown address. It is unnecessary to recite either of them.
	
	
	The matters that I have taken into account include: my preliminary view as to the form of the direction or correction; the preliminary view formed as to the direction on Mr Gallo’s evidence; the view I have formed that, ultimately, I will be seeking that the jury ignore the evidence of CL totally; and, lastly but in some ways importantly, my perception of the attitude of the jury both to the proceedings and to directions from the Court.
	
	
	If I am wrong about the foregoing, and on appeal, others form a different view, I am comforted by the fact that this direction does not cause the accused to miss an opportunity to obtain an acquittal. While I accept that may not be likely on the evidence admitted, the waste of time occasioned by such a course is miniscule, confined as it is to the addresses of counsel for the accused and my summing-up.
	
	
	The application for discharge of the jury is refused.

Introduction

3 

Section 353A(1)  of the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA) (""the 
 
CLCA"") confers a novel jurisdiction on the Full Court of the Supreme  Court of 
South  Australia  to  determine  a  second  or  subsequent  appeal  by  a  person 
convicted  on  Information1.    The  jurisdiction  is  conditioned  on  the  Full  Court's 
satisfaction  that  there  is  fresh  and  compelling  evidence  that  should,  in  the 
interests of justice, be considered on appeal.  A second or subsequent appeal may 
only be brought with the permission of the Full Court2.  The appeal may only be 
allowed  if  the  Full  Court  is  satisfied  that  there  was  a  substantial  miscarriage  of 
justice3.  

 
By special leave given by Kiefel CJ and Nettle J on 10 February 2017, the 
appellant appeals against the Full Court's refusal of permission to bring a second 
appeal  against  his  conviction  for  the  murder  of  Deborah  Joan  Leach.    The  Full 
Court  (Vanstone  and  Kelly  JJ;  Kourakis  CJ  dissenting)  determined  that  the 
evidence on which the application was based, while fresh, was not ""compelling"".  
For the reasons that follow, it was an error to refuse permission to appeal.  The 
evidence meets the criteria of being fresh and compelling and it is in the interests 
of  justice  that  it  be  considered  on  appeal.    Consideration  on  appeal,  however, 
does  not  disclose  that  there  was  a  substantial  miscarriage  of  justice  and  so  the 
appeal must be dismissed.  

Background facts and procedural history 

Deborah,  a  fifteen  year  old  school  girl,  was  murdered  on  15  July  1971.  
 
She  was  last  seen  alive  at  around  4:00pm  that  afternoon  running  down  a  track 
that led to Taperoo Beach.  Her body was found buried under a layer of seaweed 
on  Taperoo  Beach  at  around  4:20am  the  following  morning.    The  autopsy 
revealed  that  she  had  died  of  drowning  and  that  her  body  had  been  sexually 
interfered with after death. 

                                                                                                                                     
1   Section  353A  was  inserted  into  the  CLCA  by  the  Statutes  Amendment  (Appeals) 

Act 2013 (SA) and came into effect on 5 May 2013.

Only  a  handful  of  people  were  known  to  have  been  present  on  Taperoo 
Beach  on  the  afternoon  of  15  July  1971.    The  appellant  was  one  of  them.    At 
4:00pm his car was parked between some bushes adjacent to the track on which 
Deborah  was  seen  running.    The  appellant  left  Taperoo  Beach  not  later  than 
4:30pm.    On  29  July  1971  he  was  interviewed  by  the  police  and  he  denied  any 
knowledge  of,  or  involvement  in,  Deborah's  death.    He  agreed  to  the  police 
taking  possession  of,  and  examining,  the  clothing  that  he  had  been  wearing  on 
the  afternoon  of  15  July  1971.    Among  the  items  taken  by  the  police  was  a  red 
and  black  woollen  jumper.    The  fibres  of  that  jumper  matched  fibres  found  on 
Deborah's  singlet.    Two  brown  fibres  on  the  appellant's  red  and  black  jumper 
matched the brown fibres of Deborah's jumper.  

In  October  1971  the  appellant  was  charged  with  Deborah's  murder.  
 
Following a lengthy trial in the Supreme Court of South Australia, on 19 October 
1972 the jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder.  The appellant successfully 
appealed against his conviction and a new trial was ordered4.   

 
The second trial commenced on 16 April 1973.  The prosecution case was 
circumstantial and depended on the fibre evidence and the fact that the appellant 
was  one  of  the  few  male  persons  with  the  opportunity  to  have  committed  the 
offence.    On  12  July  1973  the  appellant  was  again  found  guilty  of  murder.    An 
appeal  against  conviction  was  dismissed5.    An  application  to  this  Court  for 
special leave to appeal was dismissed6.   

 
A  petition  for  mercy  dated  5  February  1974  was  submitted  to  the 
Governor and subsequently the whole case was referred by the Chief Secretary to 
the Full Court to be heard and determined as an appeal.  The appeal  constituted 
by the reference was dismissed7.   

The application for permission to bring a second appeal 

 
On 25 August 2015, the appellant applied to the Full Court for permission 
to bring a second appeal.  The fresh evidence on which the application relied was

the  report  of  Professor Michael  Horowitz  dated  10  February  2016,  which  was 
critical of the expert evidence as to the time of Deborah's death.  That evidence 
was  given  by  Dr Colin  Manock,  the  Director  of  Forensic  Pathology  at  the 
Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science in Adelaide.  

Dr Manock examined Deborah's body at Taperoo Beach at around 5:00am 
 
on 16 July 1971.  He did not measure the temperature of the body.  It had rained 
during  the  night  and  quite  a  strong  wind  was  developing  that  morning.  
Dr Manock understood that prior to his arrival, the body had been almost entirely 
covered  with  seaweed.    The  weather  would  have  affected  the  rate  at  which  the 
body  lost  heat  and  he  considered  that  there  was  no  utility  in  measuring  its 
temperature  because  he  could  not  compare  the  rate  of  cooling  at  the  time  of 
examination with the rate of cooling before the body was uncovered.   

 
In  Dr Manock's  opinion,  the  time  of  Deborah's  death  could  be  estimated 
from examination of the stomach contents, provided the time of her last meal was 
known.    Dr Manock  was  informed  that  Deborah  ate  lunch  on  15  July  1971 
between  12:30pm  and  12:45pm  and  that  it  consisted  of  a  half  pint  of  flavoured 
milk, an apple pie and a pasty.  The stomach contained four fluid ounces of partly 
digested meal.  Dr Manock estimated that three-quarters of the meal had emptied 
from the stomach.  Dr Manock concluded that death had occurred between three 
and four hours from the start of the meal, which placed the time of death between 
3:30pm and 4:30pm.   

 
Evidence given at the trial suggested that Deborah's lunch had in fact been 
eaten  between  12:15pm  and  12:30pm,  and  Dr Manock  revised  his  estimate  to 
place the time of death 15 minutes earlier, observing that ""I don't think one can 
be  very  precise  on  these  matters"".    Notwithstanding  this  caveat,  Dr Manock 
maintained that death could not have occurred later than 4:30pm.   

It  was  the  defence  case  that  estimates  of  the  time  of  death  based  on  the 
 
rate  of  gastric  emptying  are  imprecise  and  that  the  prosecution  had  failed  to 
exclude the reasonable possibility that Deborah had been attacked and killed after 
4:30pm, when it was common ground that the appellant had left Taperoo Beach.  
Dr Manock  was  taken  to  statements  in  authoritative  texts  on  forensic  pathology 
to the effect that the rate of gastric emptying is too variable to provide any certain 
indication of time of death, as many factors affect the rate and rates vary between 
individuals.  Dr Manock generally agreed with these propositions but he asserted 
that estimates of longer emptying times were limited to cases in which there were 
special  circumstances  which  altered  the  normal  rate.    Dr Manock's  opinion 
assumed that there is a normal rate and that there was no reason to consider that 
Deborah's digestion was outside it.  Dr Manock maintained that while it was not

possible  to  be  precise  as  to  the  time  of  death  within  the  range  of  three  to  four 
hours, the outer limit of that range was reliable.   

4. 

 
The  defence  called  Dr Derek  Pocock,  a  forensic  pathologist  with  the 
Department  of  Public  Health  of  Western  Australia.    Dr Pocock  considered  that 
the most reliable means of estimating time of death is to take the temperature of 
the body and calculate the time that it has had to cool.  In his opinion, estimates 
based on the rate of gastric emptying are not reliable.  The rate of emptying may 
be affected by the nature of the meal, the amount of fat and carbohydrate and the 
amount of fluid, the volume of the meal, the activities undertaken following the 
meal and the person's emotional state.  Dr Pocock disputed that it was possible to 
put an outer limit of four hours on Deborah's death from the start of her last meal.  
In cross-examination he accepted that the time for stomach contents to empty is 
""very approximately"" three to four hours.  

 
Professor Horowitz gave evidence before the Full Court on the hearing of 
the  application  for  permission  to  appeal.    He  is  a  Professor  of  Medicine  at  the 
University of Adelaide and Director of the Endocrine and Metabolic Unit at the 
Royal  Adelaide  Hospital.    For  over  35  years,  the  focus  of  Professor Horowitz' 
research has been gastric emptying.  Professor Horowitz explained that there has 
been a rapid expansion of knowledge of this subject since the mid-1970s.  Before 
1976 there were no techniques which permitted the reliable measurement of the 
rate  of  gastric  emptying.    Objectively  validated  studies  since  that  time  have 
demonstrated substantial variation in the rates of gastric emptying in individuals.   

 
Professor Horowitz  characterised  Dr Manock's  evidence  at  the  trial  as 
""unequivocally  highly  erroneous""  in  light  of  scientific  evidence  available  since 
1972.  The substantial variation in rates of emptying between individuals means 
that  estimating  time  of  death  from  the  volume  of  stomach  contents  cannot  be 
determined  with 
less.  
Professor Horowitz  calculated  that  Deborah's  lunch  had  an  energy  content  of 
680 calories.    It  was  a  meal  which  in  some  individuals  may  empty  from  the 
stomach  completely  in  less  than  three  hours  and  in  other  individuals  may  take 
more than eight hours to do so.

The Full Court

It was common ground in the Full Court that Professor Horowitz' evidence 
was  ""fresh""  (sub-s (6)(a))  and  ""reliable""  (sub-s  (6)(b)(i))8.    The  Full  Court  was 
divided on whether the evidence was ""substantial"" (sub-s (6)(b)(ii)) and whether 
it  was  ""highly  probative  in  the  context  of  the  issues  in  dispute  at  the  trial"" 
(sub-s (6)(b)(iii))9.   

 
The  majority  rejected  that  ""substantial""  in  this  context  is  to  be  given  its 
ordinary  meaning  of  ""sufficient  importance,  worth  or  value""10.    To  read  the 
provision  in  this  way,  it  was  said,  would  largely  duplicate  the  requirement  of 
""high probative value"" under the third limb11.  Their Honours concluded that the 
second limb requirement of substantiality imposes a qualitative and a quantitative 
threshold:  the evidence must be of substance and worth in its own  right, and it 
must subsist or stand by itself12.  Applying this test, Professor Horowitz' evidence 
is  not  ""substantial""  because  it  is  evidence  of  research  which  serves  only  to 
confirm the correctness of an earlier body of opinion that was closely examined 
at the trial13.  In their Honours' view, the fresh evidence does no more than show 
that  Dr Manock  was  wrong  to  state  that  death  could  not  have  occurred  after 
4:30pm:    a  point  that  was  well  made  by  Dr Pocock14.    Their Honours  also  said 
that  Professor Horowitz'  evidence  did  not  possess  high  probative  value  in  the 
context  of  the  issues  in  dispute  at  the  trial:    Dr Manock's  opinion  had  been

directly challenged at the trial and Professor Horowitz' opinion was simply added 
ammunition supporting that challenge15.   

7. 

 
Underlying  the  majority's  approach  to  the  construction  of  the  criteria 
which  qualify  fresh  evidence  as  ""compelling""  is  the  view  that  jurisdiction  to 
determine a second or subsequent appeal is a further exception to the principle of 
finality  and  the  conditions  governing  its  engagement  should  be  construed  with 
restraint.    Their  Honours  cautioned  as  to  the  need  for  particular  care  in 
determining  whether  the  conditions  are  met  when  the  fresh  evidence  is  expert 
opinion16:  

""The  experience  and  the  empirical  evidence  upon  which  each  [expert] 
draws  in  expressing  a  view  will  vary  enormously  at  any  given  time,  let 
alone  over  a  period  of  decades.    Different  views  on  any  topic  and  new 
research will always be available.  It is for the Court to ensure that, if the 
jurisdiction  given  in  s 353A  is  to  be  exercised,  the  fresh  evidence  to  be 
considered  strictly  answers  each  of  the  requirements  set  out  in  the 
provision."" 

 
The majority's conclusion, that the fresh evidence was not ""substantial"" or 
""highly  probative  in  the  context  of  the  issues  in  dispute"",  did  not  deny  that  the 
time  of  Deborah's  death  was  an  important  issue  in  the  trial.    The  conclusion 
reflected  not  only  the  assessment  that  Professor Horowitz'  evidence  would  not 
have  added  greatly  to  the  material  before  the  jury,  but  also  the  assessment  that 
the persuasive evidence of the time of death came from the civilian witnesses17.  
Their Honours observed that Professor Horowitz' evidence did not undermine the 
prosecution case18.  In their view, even if Professor Horowitz' evidence answered 
the conditions qualifying it as ""compelling"", it was not in the interests of justice 
(sub-s (1))  that  it  be  considered  on  an  appeal  because  it  would  have  made  no 
difference  to  the  resolution  of  the  issues  at  trial19.    For  the  same  reason,  their

Honours  considered  that  had  the  evidence  been  considered  on  appeal,  it  would 
not have established that a substantial miscarriage of justice had occurred20. 

8. 

 
Kourakis CJ,  in  dissent,  concluded  that  the  evidence  was  fresh  and 
compelling  and  that  it  was  in  the  interests  of  justice  that  it  be  considered  on 
appeal21.  His Honour considered that on the research now available it would be 
an  agreed  fact  that  Deborah's  death  could  have  occurred  well  after  4:50pm22.  
Notwithstanding  that  the  fibre  evidence  was,  on  its  face,  strongly  probative  of 
guilt,  Kourakis CJ  reasoned  that  the  prosecution  had  not  comprehensively 
excluded  other  sources  of  the fibres found  on  Deborah's  singlet  or  the  presence 
on  Taperoo  Beach  of  possible  offenders  after  4:25pm23.    Kourakis CJ  was  not 
persuaded  that  a  properly  directed  jury  would  necessarily  have  convicted  the 
appellant at a trial at which Dr Manock's dogmatic opinion as to the time of death 
was not in evidence24.   

 
As  the  respondent  submits,  the  latter  conclusion  is  suggestive  of  the 
application of a less stringent test than applies to the determination of an appeal 
on  fresh  evidence  under  the  common  form  criminal  appeal  provision25.  
Nonetheless, his Honour's ultimate conclusion26 was stated conformably with the 
test  that  commanded  the  support  of  the  majority  in  Mickelberg  v  The  Queen27:  
whether  the  court  considers  that  there  is  a  significant  possibility  that  the  jury, 
acting  reasonably,  would  have  acquitted  the  appellant  had  the  fresh  evidence 
been before it at the trial.

It is not in issue that the Full Court was right to hold that the question of 
whether  there  has  been  a  substantial  miscarriage  of  justice  for  the  purposes  of 
s 353A(3)  is  answered  by  applying  the  Mickelberg  test28.    As  the  majority 
observed,  the  presupposition  for  a  second  or  subsequent  appeal  is  that  the 
accused has had a fair trial according to law on the available evidence.  There is 
no reason why an appeal under s 353A should be determined by applying a less 
rigorous test than applies to an appeal against conviction on fresh evidence under 
s 353 of the CLCA29.

The  respondent  supports  the  broad  thrust  of  the  majority's  analysis, 
submitting that the requirements of sub-s (6)(b) are to be understood as imposing 
a  ""robust  threshold""  on  the  jurisdiction  to  determine  a  second  or  subsequent 
appeal.  This approach, it is said, is consistent with the scheme of the CLCA:  a 
person  convicted  on  Information  may  appeal  by  right  on  a  question  of  law  and 
with the permission of the Full Court or on the certificate of the court of trial on 
any other ground30.  The determination of the appeal is final31.  If the conditions 
governing  an  appeal  under  s 353A  are  liberally  construed,  the  absence  of 
limitation on the number of applications that may be brought is said to have the 
capacity to undermine the statutory scheme.  The Parliament's choice to retain the

Full Court to be heard as in the case of an appeal32 is suggested to reinforce the 
narrow compass of the s 353A appeal.   

10. 

 
The respondent does not embrace the majority's analysis that ""substantial"" 
imposes a quantitative and qualitative threshold.  In the respondent's submission, 
""substantial""  is  to  be  understood  in  the  context  that  a  second  or  subsequent 
appeal  may  only  be  allowed  in  a  case  in  which  the  Full  Court  thinks  that  there 
was a ""substantial miscarriage of justice"".  The fresh evidence, it is said, must be 
substantial in its ability to bear on the determination of that question.   

The scope of s 353A 

 
Section 353A manifests an intention that finality yield in the face of fresh 
and  compelling  evidence  which,  when  taken  with  the  evidence  at  the  trial, 
satisfies the Full Court that there has been a substantial miscarriage of justice.  If, 
following an unsuccessful s 353A appeal, further fresh and compelling evidence 
is  discovered,  the  evident  intention  is  that  the  Full  Court  have  jurisdiction  to 
remedy  any  substantial  miscarriage  of  justice.    The  right  to  approach  the  Full 
Court  directly  conferred  by  s  353A  in  such  a  case  is  to  be  contrasted  with  the 
mechanism of executive referral in the case of a petition of mercy.  The concern 
that  a  convicted  person  may  bring  successive,  meritless  applications  under 
s 353A  is  addressed  by  the  requirement  to  obtain  the  Full  Court's  permission  to 
appeal.  

Nothing  in  the  scheme  of  the  CLCA  or  the  extrinsic  material33  provides 
 
support  for  a  construction  of  the  words  ""reliable"",  ""substantial""  and  ""highly 
probative"" in other than their ordinary meaning.  Understood in this way, each of 
the three limbs of sub-s (6)(b) has work to do, although commonly there will be 
overlap  in  the  satisfaction  of  each.    The  criterion  of  reliability  requires  the 
evidence  to  be  credible  and  provide  a  trustworthy  basis  for  fact  finding34.    The 
criterion  of  substantiality  requires  that  the  evidence  is  of  real  significance  or 
importance  with  respect  to  the  matter  it  is  tendered  to  prove.    Plainly  enough, 
evidence  may  be  reliable  but  it  may  not  be  relevantly  ""substantial"".    Evidence

that  meets  the  criteria  of  reliability  and  substantiality  will  often  meet  the  third 
criterion  of  being  highly  probative  in  the  context  of  the  issues  in  dispute  at  the 
trial,  but  this  will  not  always  be  so.    The  focus  of  the  third  criterion  is  on  the 
conduct  of  the  trial.    What  is  encompassed  by  the  expression  ""the  issues  in 
dispute  at  the  trial""  will  depend  upon  the  circumstances  of  the  case.    Fresh 
evidence  relating  to  identity  is  unlikely  to  meet  the  third  criterion  in  a  case  in 
which  the  sole  issue  at  the  trial  was  whether  the  prosecution  had  excluded  that 
the  accused's  act  was  done  in  self-defence.    On  the  other  hand,  fresh  evidence 
disclosing  a  line  of  defence  that  was  not  apparent  at  the  time  of  trial  may  meet 
the third criterion because it bears on the ultimate issue in dispute, which is proof 
of guilt.   

It does not do justice to Professor Horowitz' evidence to characterise it as 
 
merely  supporting  Dr Pocock's  opinion.    As  earlier  noted,  Dr Manock's  opinion 
was based upon acceptance that there is a normal rate of gastric emptying in the 
human  population.    Kourakis CJ  was  right  to  say  that  Professor Horowitz' 
evidence  based  on  the  results  of  objectively  validated  studies  falsifies  the  basis 
for that opinion35.  Had the results of these studies been known at the date of the 
trial, Dr Manock's opinion as to the time of Deborah's death should not have been 
admitted over objection.  Professor Horowitz' evidence is of real significance on 
the issue of the time of Deborah's death.  It possesses the requisite high probative 
value given that time of death was an issue in dispute at the trial.  

Jurisdiction  under  s 353A(1)  is  further  conditioned  on  the  Full  Court's 
 
satisfaction  that  it  is  in  the  interests  of  justice  to  consider  the  fresh  and 
compelling evidence on appeal.  Commonly, where fresh evidence is compelling, 
the interests of justice will favour considering it on appeal.  Nonetheless, as the 
respondent  submits,  it  is  possible  to  envisage  circumstances,  such  as  where  an 
applicant  has  made  a  public  confession  of  guilt,  where  the  interests  of  justice 
may  not  favour  that  course.    Contrary  to  the  analysis  of  the  majority36,  the 
circumstance that a conviction is long-standing does not provide a reason why, in 
the  interests  of  justice,  fresh  and  compelling  evidence  should  not  be  considered 
on a second or subsequent appeal.   

29 

30

The majority's consideration of the interests of justice was posited on the 
 
view  that  Professor Horowitz'  evidence  did  not  undermine  the  conclusion  of

guilt37.  This was to conflate the interests of justice with the determinative issue 
in the appeal.  

12. 

 
As explained, Professor Horowitz' evidence is fresh and compelling and it 
is  in  the  interests  of  justice  that  it  be  considered  on  appeal.    The  issue  in  the 
appeal is whether the appellant has established on the balance of probability that, 
in  light  of  Professor Horowitz'  evidence  taken  with the  evidence  adduced  at  the 
trial,  there  is  a  significant  possibility  that  a  jury,  acting  reasonably,  would  have 
acquitted.  The answer to that question requires consideration of the whole of the 
evidence.  

The trial  

The evidence  

 
Deborah  was  living  with  her  parents  at  40  Morea  Street,  Osborne,  South 
Australia.    On  the  afternoon  of  15  July  1971,  Deborah  and  her  friend,  Janice 
Hazelwood,  left  school  at  around  3:30pm.    The  school  was  located  on  Morea 
Street,  to  the  south  of  Deborah's  home.    The  two  walked  north  along  Morea 
Street to Deborah's home, where they parted.  The walk took about five minutes.  
It would seem that Deborah went inside the house, put down her school bag, put 
a sponge cake that she had cooked at school on the kitchen table, changed from 
her school uniform into a pair of tartan slacks and a brown jumper, and left the 
house with her dog to go for a walk on Taperoo Beach.   

 
Taperoo  Beach  faces  west  and  lies  between  Outer  Harbor  (to  the  north) 
and  Largs  Bay  (to  the  south).    Morea  Street  is  to  the  east  of,  and  parallel  with, 
Lady Gowrie Drive.  Lady Gowrie Drive runs in a north south direction parallel 
to  Taperoo  Beach.    An  unfenced  paddock  opposite  Deborah's  home  separated 
Morea Street and Lady Gowrie Drive.  A track roughly opposite Deborah's home 
led  from  Lady  Gowrie  Drive  to  the  beach.    After  a  short  distance  the  track 
divided  into  smaller  tracks  leading  in  southerly,  south-westerly  and  westerly 
directions.    Between  the  junction  of  two  of  these  tracks  were  two  stands  of 
bushes.  Opposite these bushes, about 100 yards west of Lady Gowrie Drive, was 
a shed belonging to the Taperoo Beach Surf Lifesaving Club.  On the afternoon 
of  these  events  the  appellant's  car  was  parked  between  the  bushes,  roughly 
opposite the shed.

At  around  4:00pm  Mrs Hazelwood,  Janice's  mother,  was  driving  along 
Morea  Street  and  saw  Deborah  with  Deborah's  dog  running  across  the  paddock 
towards  the  beach.    Deborah  was  wearing  a  jumper,  which  Mrs Hazelwood 
thought was brown, and dark coloured slacks.   

The prosecution called persons who were known to have been present on 
 
Taperoo  Beach  between  2:00pm  and  4:20pm  on  the  afternoon  of  15  July  1971.  
Sandra  Drummond  and  her  father,  Colin  Lukeman,  were  fishing  on  the  beach 
between  around  2:00pm  and  3:40pm  that  afternoon.    The  only  people  that 
Mrs Drummond saw on the beach were a man sitting on the seaweed bank (later 
identified  as  Kenneth  Streeter),  two  couples  walking  along  the  beach,  and  three 
men in a fishing boat.  She spoke to one of the couples and learned that they had 
come from a liner which was moored in Outer Harbor.  Mrs Drummond did not 
see  Mr Streeter  on  the  beach  at  the  time  she  left.    As  she  drove  away  from  the 
beach a small car driven by a man turned off Lady Gowrie Drive and passed her 
car, travelling towards the beach.  Mr Lukeman recalled the same small number 
of persons as present on the beach  that afternoon.  He spoke to Mr Streeter and 
the older of the two couples.  He, too, said that Mr Streeter appeared to have left 
the beach by the time he and his daughter departed.  He saw a ""cherry coloured"" 
car,  which  he  thought  was  a  Datsun,  turn  off  Lady  Gowrie  Drive  and  head 
towards the beach as they were leaving.   

 
Mr Streeter lived about five minutes' walk from Taperoo Beach.  He took 
his  dog  to  the  beach  sometime  around  2:30pm  that  afternoon.    He  was  back  at 
home at about 3:50pm to listen to the last leg of a race on which he had placed a 
bet.   

 
Dennis  Shiels  was  fishing  with  two  workmates,  Alexander  Dickson  and 
Patrick  Keating,  at  Taperoo  Beach  that  afternoon.    On  the  way  to  the  beach, 
Mr Shiels  noticed  a  red  Torana  parked  near  the  lifesaving  shed.    This  was  at 
around 3:15pm.  Mr Shiels saw two  men, a  woman and a dog on the beach  (on 
the  prosecution  case,  Mr Lukeman  and  Mr Streeter,  Mrs Drummond,  and 
Mr Streeter's  dog)  when  they  arrived.    He  and  his  companions  launched  their 
boat and went fishing.  While in the boat, Mr Shiels saw two people on the beach 
in the vicinity of where he had seen the two men and the woman earlier, though 
he was not able to say whether they were the same people.  In cross-examination 
he  was  asked  if  one  of  the  persons  he  saw  from  the  boat  was  wearing  a  red 
jumper.  He said that one was wearing a red cardigan or jumper.  He thought the 
person wearing the red cardigan was the woman.  He went on to say that ""it was 
too far away"" and he could not say it was a woman.  These people moved from 
the beach towards Lady Gowrie Drive.  The weather was not good and Mr Shiels 
and his companions returned to the shore.

When  they  were  leaving,  Mr Shiels  observed  that  the  red  Torana  was 
parked near the lifesaving shed where he had earlier seen it.  Mr Keating made a 
comment and Mr Shiels looked back at the Torana and saw the letters ""RCC"" on 
the  number  plate.    As  they  neared  Lady  Gowrie  Drive  Mr Shiels  again  looked 
back  and  he  noticed  that  the  red  Torana  was  shielded  from  view  by  bushes.  
Mr Shiels recalled that they left the beach at around 4:20pm.   

 
Mr Dickson remembered seeing a maroon Torana next to some bushes, to 
their left, as they drove down the track past the lifesaving shed on arrival.  This 
was around 3:10pm.  He saw a man and a woman who appeared to be fishing by 
the edge of the water.  As they were leaving he again saw the maroon Torana and 
he  noted  that  the  first three  letters  of  the  number  plate  were  RCC.    Mr Dickson 
agreed  that  they  had  left  Taperoo  Beach  at  around  4:20pm.    Mr Keating  was  in 
Scotland at the date of the trial and he did not give evidence.  

 
Wojciech Tajak ran the Taperoo Beach kiosk.  The kiosk faced onto Lady 
Gowrie  Drive  and  was  located  just  to  the  north  of  the  track  leading  from  Lady 
Gowrie  Drive  to  the  beach  and  was  approximately  100  yards  due  east  of  the 
lifesaving shed.  Sometime between 11:30am and 12 noon on 15 July Mr Tajak 
saw  a  red  Torana  which  was  parked  in  front  of  the  kiosk.    He  sold  the  driver  a 
packet of cigarettes.  He saw a similar car in the parking lot south of the kiosk at 
around  1:00pm.    Later,  at  around  3:00pm,  he  saw  a  red  car,  which  was  of  a 
similar  size,  parked  ""[o]n  the  corner  of  the  Lifesaving  shed"".    Mr Tajak  was 
uncertain  about  the  time  he  left  the  kiosk  on  that  day.    Initially  he  put  it  at 
3:45pm  or  3:50pm  and  said  that  it  ""must  have  been  before""  4:00pm,  but  he 
conceded  that  he  ""wouldn't  be  one  hundred  per  cent  sure"".    As  he  was  taking 
some stock from the kiosk to his car, he looked towards the sea and he saw a dog 
to  the  south-west  of  the  kiosk  running  from  the  direction  of  Largs  Bay  towards 
Outer Harbor.  A girl ran after the dog in the same direction.  Mr Tajak said the 
girl  was  wearing  something  ""similar  to  a  school  uniform""  and  he  described  her 
clothing  as  being  ""[n]avy  blue,  something  to  that  effect,  or  it  could  have  been 
black"". 

 
Deborah's mother, Gwenneth Leach, arrived home from work at the usual 
time, which was around 4:40pm.  Deborah used to take her dog for a walk on the 
beach each afternoon after school but Mrs Leach said that ""she was always home 
when I got home normally"".  Mrs Leach looked for Deborah and saw her school 
clothes in her bedroom.  She thought that she might have gone for a longer walk 
than  usual.    After  10  minutes  Mrs Leach  decided  that  Deborah  should  be  at 
home.    She  looked  out  the  front  window  but  she  could  only  see  Deborah's  dog 
playing  on  top  of  the  bank  of  seaweed.    This  was  about  4:50pm.    Mrs Leach 
walked  over  to  the  beach  and  called  out  to  Deborah.    There  was  no  sign  of  her

and it occurred to Mrs Leach that Deborah had gone home along a different path.  
Mrs Leach  collected  the  dog  and  returned  home.    When  she  discovered  that 
Deborah was not at home she went back to the beach and continued to look for 
her.  This would have been at about 5:15pm or 5:20pm.   

On the first occasion when Mrs Leach walked to the beach, and collected 
 
the  dog,  she  saw  nobody  else.    On  the  second  occasion,  she  saw  two  men 
walking horses in  the  water, a  young girl riding a horse, and a woman bringing 
her  dog  down  to  the  beach.    When  she  was  unable  to  find  Deborah,  Mrs Leach 
rang her husband from a nearby telephone. 

 
Mr Leach returned home at around 6:10pm and contacted the police.  He 
and  a  neighbour  then  went  to  search  for  Deborah.    After  an  initial  search  they 
returned home, collected the dog, and went back.  They walked down the track to 
the  beach  and  turned  north.    At  its  most  western  point  the  surface  of  the  beach 
was sand.  Moving east there was a bank of seaweed about one foot to 18 inches 
high38.    The  bank  extended  for  about  20  yards  to  a  second,  higher  bank  of 
seaweed.    The  second  bank  was  about  three  feet  high.    Mr  Leach  and  his 
neighbour  walked  on  the  landward  side  of  the  high  seaweed  bank,  proceeding 
some distance past the lifesaving shed.  Mr Leach was looking for footprints.  He 
observed  some  in  a  clearing.    They  appeared  to  have  been  made  by  more  than 
one person.  Mr Leach thought that one set of tracks could have been Deborah's 
because the pattern of the footprint was similar to the pattern of the boots that she 
had been wearing.  The dog had led them to this clearing but the dog seemed to 
be confused and did not know which way to go.   

 
Mr Leach  returned  home  and  rang  the  police  again.    Later  that  evening 
Mr Leach  showed  two  detectives  the  clearing.    They  drove  down  the  track  past 
the kiosk for about 100 yards.  Then they got out of the vehicle and walked about 
60 yards  to  a  location  on  the  eastern  side  of  the  high  seaweed  bank 
approximately  due  west  of  the  kiosk.    It  had  been  raining  and  most  of  the 
markings that Mr Leach had earlier observed were no longer visible.   

 
In the early hours of 16 July the police located a rubber boot, a transistor 
radio and a dog lead not far from the water on the most western point of the first, 
lower  bank  of  seaweed.    They  belonged  to  Deborah.    Her  body,  buried  under 
seaweed, was located slightly to the south of her belongings and 20 yards east of 

                                                                                                                                     
38   Consistently with the evidence given at the trial reference to distances will be given 

in Imperial measures.

them on the second, higher bank.  Her arms  were extended over her head.   She 
was  wearing  a  brown  woollen  jumper  which  had  been  pulled  up  and  was 
covering her mouth and nose.  Her slacks had been completely removed from her 
right leg.  Her white singlet remained in place.  

The  autopsy  revealed  a  small  tear  on  the  posterior  of  the  vaginal  wall.  
 
Dr Manock  considered  this  occurred  after  Deborah's  death  and  was  more  likely 
to  have  been  occasioned  by  sexual  intercourse  than  digital  penetration.    There 
was  semen  in  the  vagina.    Dr Manock  concluded  that  death  had  occurred  as  a 
consequence of drowning in salt water. 

The appellant's account of events 

 
The  appellant  was  first  questioned  by  police  on  29  July  1971.    A  signed 
copy of the interview was in evidence.  The appellant acknowledged that he was 
the owner of a red Torana sedan registration number RCC 718.  He said that he 
had  arrived  at  Taperoo  Beach  around  4:00pm  on  15  July  and  that  his  car  had 
been parked on the south side of the lifesaving shed, facing the sea, until around 
4:25pm39.    He  said  that  he  had  walked  for  about  half  a  mile  in  a  southerly 
direction.    He  was  asked  what  he  had  been  wearing  and  he  replied  ""[b]lack 
trousers, a red or blue jumper I cannot think which one I was wearing"".   

 
The police accompanied the appellant to his home on 29 July to collect the 
clothes  that  he  had  been  wearing.    Detective  Sergeant  Cocks  said  that  the 
appellant handed him a red and black jumper, a pair of dark trousers and a pair of 
black shoes.  Detective Sergeant Cocks said that he also took possession of a blue 
jumper, a dark grey jumper and a mohair jumper. 

 
On 6 October 1971 the appellant went with the police to Taperoo Beach.  
He showed the police where he had parked his car:  a location adjacent to a large 
bush  on  the  southern  side  of  the  lifesaving  shed.    The  police  asked  why  he  had 
waited until late in the afternoon to take a walk along the beach.  The appellant 
said he had not been at Taperoo Beach all the time that day:  he had driven back 
and  forth  along  the  beaches  to  Glenelg.    He  was  asked  to  show  the  police  the 

                                                                                                                                     
39   The  transcript  of  the  interview  records  4:45pm  and  not  4:25pm,  but  Detective 
Zeunert,  in  cross-examination,  said  that  the  reference  to  4:45pm  in  the  transcript 
was an error.  The reason he thought it was a typing error was because at that time 
he phrased a question around the incident to the time of 4:25pm, but he could not 
discount the possibility that he had put the question by reference to 4:45pm.

route that he had taken on his walk.  He said he had walked to the northernmost 
building  of  the  Largs  Bay  Police  Academy  and  then  walked  back.    He  had  not 
walked or sat on the seaweed at any time that afternoon.     

 
The appellant did not give evidence at the trial.  His evidence given at the 
first trial was read in the prosecution case.  In summary, he said that he had been 
looking for work that day.  He had checked the newspaper but had not found any 
jobs.  He then decided to go for a drive, initially to the Adelaide Hills and then to 
the  beaches.    He  stopped  at  Taperoo  Beach  and  purchased  a  drink  and  an 
ice-cream  at  the  kiosk.    He  then  parked  his  car  between  the  kiosk  and  the 
lifesaving shed and read a comic book.  After this he drove back towards Glenelg 
and  then  he  returned  to  Taperoo  Beach  and  parked  in  the  same  general  area:  
""just off the track by a bush"" on the southern side of the lifesaving shed.  

 
The appellant said that he had walked south along Taperoo Beach, on the 
landward side of the seaweed bank, to the Police Academy and then back to his 
car following the same route.  He saw no one on the beach.  He then drove from 
the beach to the city to collect his wife.  She was working at the  Post Office on 
King  William  Street  and  was  due  to  finish  work  at  5:00pm.    He  arrived  at  the 
Post Office at around 4:45pm.   

 
The  appellant  denied  that  he  had  been  wearing  his  red  and  black  jumper 
and he said he  had handed his  blue jumper to the  police along with  his red and 
black jumper.  At the time he had been unsure about which jumper he had been 
wearing  on  15  July.    Subsequently,  and  before  his  arrest  on  6  October,  he 
recalled  that  he  had  been  wearing  the  blue  jumper.    He  rejected  the  suggestion 
that  he  had  changed  his  account  after  hearing  the  prosecution  evidence  at  the 
committal  hearing.    He  recalled  that  he  had  been  wearing  his  blue  jumper 
because he had been looking for work and it was his best jumper.   

The  appellant  agreed  that  he  had  told  the  police  initially  that  he  had 
 
arrived at Taperoo Beach on the second occasion at around 4:00pm, and that he 
had arrived at the Post Office at 5:00pm.  When the appellant was first spoken to 
by the police he said that he had walked as far as ""the guns"", a reference to the 
gun mountings at the Police Academy.  On 6 October when he showed the police 
the route that he had taken he said that he had not walked as far as the guns.  He 
denied that he had changed his account because of a realisation that he could not 
have  walked  to  the  guns  and  back  and  had  time  to  get  to  the  Post  Office  by 
5:00pm.  The appellant's wife gave evidence that on 15 July 1971 she left work at 
""a few minutes before 5"" and the appellant was in his car in King William Street.  
It was not in issue that the appellant must have left Taperoo Beach not later than 
4:30pm.

Detective  Sergeant  Cocks,  who  was  in  charge  of  the  South  Australian 
Police  Forensic  Science  Laboratory,  gave  evidence  of  the  collection  and 
examination  of  fibres  from  Deborah's  clothing  and  the  appellant's  clothing.    He 
took samples from Deborah's singlet with tweezers and by dabbing a short length 
of adhesive tape on the garment.  He found 17 black, 19 red, and one blue fibre 
on the upper front of the singlet.  He also found a number of brown fibres, which 
were  consistent  with  the  fibres  of  the  brown  jumper  that  Deborah  had  been 
wearing,  and  a  number  of  white  fibres  on  the  upper  front  of  the  singlet.    He 
always ignored  white fibres in forensic work  because  they are so common.   On 
the  lower  part  of  the  singlet  there  were  brown  fibres  which  were  similar  to  the 
fibres  of  Deborah's jumper  and  a  mixture  of  coloured  fibres:    red,  black,  green, 
blue and mauve.   

 
Deborah's  slacks  were  of  tartan  design  and  were  composed  of  black, 
green,  brown,  blue,  red,  mauve  and  yellow  fibres.    The  red  fibres  comprised  a 
""purply""  red  and  a  lighter  red.    The  majority  of  these  fibres  were  wool  fibres.  
There  were  no  differences  between  the  black  wool  fibres  of  the  slacks  and  the 
black wool fibres on the upper front of Deborah's singlet.  The red fibres from the 
upper front of the singlet were ""completely different"" from the purply red fibres 
of  the  slacks.    There  were  no  differences  in  colour  or  appearance  between  the 
lighter red wool fibres of the slacks and the red wool fibres on the upper part of 
the singlet.   

 
The  fibres  on  the  bottom  of  the  singlet  consisted  of  23  red  and  25  black 
fibres, 14 green, 14 brown, six blue and one mauve.  The green, blue and mauve 
fibres  were  all  similar  to  the  fibres  of  the  same  colours  taken  from  the  slacks.  
Four  of  the  brown  fibres  were  similar  to  the  brown  fibres  in  the  slacks  and  ten 
were similar to the brown fibres of Deborah's jumper.   

 
In Detective Sergeant  Cocks' opinion, it was  of the very highest order of 
improbability  that  the  red  and  black  fibres  on  the  upper  front  of  the  singlet  had 
come from the slacks.  The most common fibre in the slacks was green and there 
were no green fibres on the upper front of the singlet.  The second most common 
fibre  in  the  slacks  was  black,  and  there  were  similar  black  fibres  on  the  upper 
front of the singlet.  The third most common fibre in the slacks was brown, and 
there were no brown fibres on the upper front of the singlet that were consistent 
with the slacks.  There were no blue fibres on the upper front of the singlet that 
were consistent with the slacks, nor were there any purply red fibres on the upper 
front  of  the  singlet.    The  purply  red  fibres  were  more  prevalent  than  the  lighter 
red fibres in the weave of the slacks.  Although the lighter red fibres on the upper

front  of  the  singlet  were  microscopically  similar  to  the  lighter  red  fibres  in  the 
slacks, the lighter red fibres in the slacks were part of the same thread made up of 
brown and purply red.  

 
Although Detective Sergeant Cocks found black wool fibres in Deborah's 
home which were similar to the black wool fibres found on the upper front of the 
singlet, these were not found in association with any red wool fibres.  Detective 
Sergeant Cocks found no fibres at all in Deborah's home which matched the red 
fibres on the upper front of the singlet.  He did find a source in Deborah's home 
for the blue fibre found on the upper front of the singlet. 

 
There  was  seaweed  in  the  material  vacuumed  from  the  red  and  black 
jumper  and  in  the  vacuumings  from  the  dark  trousers.    In  the  vacuumings  from 
the  red  and  black  jumper  Detective  Sergeant  Cocks  found  two  brown,  artificial 
fibres, and green, blue, mauve, yellow and some further brown fibres.  All of the 
fibres could have been sourced to materials in the appellant's home save for the 
two brown, artificial fibres.  These did not appear to originate from any materials 
in  the  appellant's  home.    They  were  indistinguishable  from  the  brown,  artificial 
fibres  of  Deborah's  jumper.    Random  samples  of  the  fibres  taken  from  the 
appellant's red and black jumper were in the ratio of 19 red to 18 black.   

 
Mr  Charles  Crisp,  a  senior  analyst  employed  with  the  South  Australian 
Government Department of Chemistry, gave evidence in the prosecution case of 
the results of microscopic examination and chemical testing of fibres taken from 
Deborah's  clothing  and  the  appellant's  red  and  black  jumper.    These  revealed  a 
large number of points of similarity between the red and black fibres taken from 
the  singlet  and  the  red  and  black  fibres  of  the  jumper  and  no  significant 
dissimilarities.   

 
The defence called Mr Jack Fish, who for many years held an appointment 
as senior biologist with the Home Office Laboratories, Nottingham, in England.  
At  the  date  of  trial  Mr Fish  was  the  Director  of  the  Cardiff  Forensic  Science 
Laboratory.    In  his  years  at  the  Nottingham  laboratory  Mr  Fish  had  extensive 
experience in  the forensic examination of  fibres.   He  reviewed  Mr Crisp's  work 
and agreed with his conclusions.  Mr Fish agreed the fact that no green, artificial 
black,  brown  or  purply  red  fibres  were  located  on  the  upper  front  of  the  singlet 
indicated  that  the  slacks  were  an  extremely  improbable  source  of  the  red  and 
black fibres.  Mr Fish agreed that the tartan slacks were made of mainly woollen 
fibres but with a mixture of some artificial fibres.  The black woollen fibre in the 
slacks  was  associated  with  a  black  artificial  fibre.    The  bright  red  fibre  of  the 
slacks  occurred  only  as  part  of  a  thread  with  a  brown  woollen  and  a  purply  red 
fibre.    The  length  of  the  red  and  black  fibres  taken  from  the  upper  front  of  the

knitted woollen garment.  Deborah's tartan slacks were a woven garment.

thin 

jumper  by  a  process  known  as 

 
In addition to the tests carried out by Mr Crisp, Mr Fish tested a sample of 
the  fibres  taken  from  the  upper  front  of  the  singlet  and  the  fibres  of  the 
appellant's  red  and  black 
layer 
chromatography.  The results of the tests conducted by Mr Fish established that 
at least three different dye mixtures were used in dyeing the bright red fibres of 
the slacks and at least two different dye mixtures were used in dyeing the black 
woollen  fibres  of  the  slacks.    This  was  in  contrast  with  results  of  all  the  work 
done  on  the  red  and  black  fibres  found  on  the  upper  front  of  the  singlet,  which 
showed  no  variability  between  the  blacks  and  the  reds.    Mr Fish  agreed  that  all 
the  black  fibres  in  the  red  and  black  jumper  were  dyed  with  the  same  dye 
material as the black fibres located on the singlet, and all the red fibres from the 
red and black jumper were dyed with the same red dye material as the red dye of 
the  fibres  on  the  top  of  the  singlet.    Taking  into  account  the  results  of  the 
microscopic  examination,  chemical  testing  and  thin  layer  chromatography, 
Mr Fish agreed there were ""a very large number of points of similarity between 
the reds and blacks said to be on the top of the singlet and the reds and the blacks 
from the pullover, and no significant dissimilarity"".   

The way the parties put their cases 

It  was  the  prosecution  case  that  Deborah  died  on  Taperoo  Beach  as  the 
 
result  of  an  attack  by  a  male  who  intended  to  sexually  assault  her.    Taperoo 
Beach was a fairly lonely beach and her assailant was one of a small number of 
males  present  on  the  beach  at  the  time.    The  red  and  black  fibres  found  on  the 
upper  part  of  Deborah's  singlet  were  consistent  in  characteristics  and  relative 
frequency  with  the  fibres  of  the  appellant's  red  and  black  jumper,  which  it  was 
contended he  was  wearing that afternoon.    This  inference  was  supported  by  the 
presence  of  the  two  brown,  artificial  fibres  and  the  scraps  of  seaweed  found  on 
the  jumper.    The  prosecution  contended  that  the  appellant  had  moulded  his 
account  of  the  length  of  his  walk  and  the  clothes  that  he  was  wearing  to  avert 
suspicion.    More  generally,  the  prosecution  contended  that  the  appellant's 
account of his conduct was unsatisfactory:  there was no explanation for why he 
had chosen to park in a location that was more or less concealed and no apparent 
reason for ""hanging around"" at the beach during the course of the day.  

65 

 
In closing address, defence counsel submitted ""[w]e agree that there is an 
indication on the evidence as it stands that someone wearing red, or red and black 
had contact with the singlet presumably during an act of necrophilia"".  It was the 
defence  case  that  the  prosecution  had  not  established  that  Deborah  died  before

4:30pm, when the appellant left Taperoo Beach.  It was pointed out that the dyes 
used  in  the  appellant's  red  and  black  jumper  were  common  dyes.    It  was  also 
pointed out that the defence had arranged for the fibres to be subjected to  more 
sophisticated  scientific  testing  than  had  been  undertaken  by  the  prosecution 
authorities.    While  Mr Fish's  tests  had  not  eliminated  the  appellant's  jumper  as 
the source of the fibres on the singlet, the defence invited the jury to consider the 
improbability  that  a  guilty  man  would  have  taken  the  risk  that  testing  might 
confirm the prosecution case.   

The way the trial judge left the issue 

66 

The trial judge left the prosecution case on the question of time of death in 

 
these terms: 

""Taperoo  Beach,  on  a  winter's  afternoon  on  a  week-day,  appears  to  be  a 
fairly little used area.  You must ask yourself whether Debbie died on the 
beach.  The sea material found in her lungs may lead  you to think so.  If 
so,  we  must  carefully  consider  when  she  died.    We  know  that  she  was 
alive at about 4 pm on the 15th.  We know that she died some time before 
4.20 am on the 16th for that is when Mr Richter found the body.   

To  try  to  fix  a  time  of  death  more  precisely  we  have  to  consider  the 
evidence of  Dr Manock  the  pathologist.    You  will  have  to  make  up  your 
minds as to whether you accept him as a man of science, competent in his 
work.  You will have to determine what weight you give to his evidence, 
and  since  his  evidence  is  in  some  respects  founded  on  other  evidence, 
especially  on  evidence  of  the  stomach  contents  and  the  time  of  the  last 
meal before death, you will have to examine that evidence too.   

…  [Dr Manock] placed the time of death at about three to four hours after 
the start of the last meal, so ... that puts the time of death at three to four 
hours after about 12.15; this is somewhere between 3.15 and 4.15. 

You  will  bear  in  the  mind  the  submission  by  Mr Borick,  supported  by 
Dr Pocock and various textbooks, three to four or four and a half hours is 
an  average  time  for  an  ordinary  meal  to  pass  through  the  stomach  of  a 
person in an ordinary physical state of health.   

…    It  may  be,  on  Dr Manock's  evidence  alone,  you  could  not  be  certain 
that Debbie died before 4.30 pm, although you might think this probable.  
However, you must consider his evidence and the strictures made upon it, 
and form your own conclusions.

You  will,  when  considering  his  evidence,  think  also  of  other  evidence, 
such as Mrs Leach's evidence, which assists in fixing the time of death."" 

His Honour continued: 

""[I]f we accept the evidence that Debbie was alive on the  beach at  about 
4 pm or a few minutes earlier we can narrow the gap at the beginning.   

Mrs Leach looked for Debbie first from her window and then on the beach 
itself.    She  gives  her  time  of  arriving  home  about  4.40  pm  when  Debbie 
was usually home.  Her time of looking through the window is ten minutes 
later.    She  saw  the  dog  through  the  window  playing  on  the  seaweed  but 
not Debbie.  She went down to the beach.  If you are satisfied that Debbie 
had been attacked by this time and if you accept Mrs Leach's evidence as 
to  time,  you  may  also  be  satisfied  that  the  attack  was  before  5  pm  and 
probably before the time that the dog was playing alone."" 

67 

68 

 
The jury was directed that unless it was satisfied that there was ""chest to 
chest contact between the [appellant] and the deceased"" it was to acquit without 
going any further.  The jury could only  be satisfied of chest to chest contact on 
the  basis  of  its  acceptance  that  the  appellant  was  wearing  his  red  and  black 
jumper  that  day.    The  consideration  of  whether  there  has  been  a  substantial 
miscarriage of justice is to be undertaken upon acceptance of that fact.   

A substantial miscarriage of justice? 

 
Dr Manock's  evidence  as  to  time  of  death  placed  the  appellant  as  one  of 
the few persons on Taperoo Beach at the time of the attack.  The appellant adopts 
Kourakis CJ's  analysis  that  Professor Horowitz'  evidence  markedly  extends  the 
period  during  which  some  other  person  had  the  opportunity  to  commit  the 
offence40.  Among the possibilities proposed by  the appellant at trial and on the 
appeal was that Deborah may have left the beach in company with her assailant 
and  that  her  body  may  have  been  deposited  on  the  bank  of  seaweed  later  that 
evening.    In  support  of  this  hypothesis  it  was  argued  that  had  Deborah's  body 
been  lying  under  the  seaweed  shortly  after  4:50pm  when  Mrs Leach  walked 
along  the  beach  looking  for  her,  the  probability  is  the  dog  would  have  led 
Mrs Leach to the body.  The footprints and tyre marks in the clearing were also 
suggested  to  support  the  hypothesis  that  Deborah  may  have  left  the  beach  with 
her assailant.

The footprints and tyre marks are neutral.  No inference should be drawn 
from  the  circumstance  that  Mrs Leach  did  not  see  Deborah's  boot  or  other 
belongings or her body when she went to the beach to look for her.  On the first 
occasion,  Mrs Leach  went  to  where  the  dog  was  playing,  looked  around  and 
called  out  for  Deborah,  and  took  the  dog  home.    On  the  second  occasion,  she 
walked  along  the  sand  on  the  seaward  side  of  the  bank  of  seaweed  in  the 
direction of Outer Harbor.  She thought that she walked nearly to the lifesaving 
shed.  She then climbed over the seaweed and walked back on the landward side 
calling out for Deborah.  On this occasion Mrs Leach did not have the dog with 
her  and  it  is  not  clear  that  she  walked  as  far  north  as  the  location  at  which 
Deborah's belongings were found before she turned back.   

Nor  should  the  inference  be  drawn  that  Deborah's  body  was  not  buried 
 
under the seaweed at the time that Mr Leach and his neighbour carried out their 
searches.    On  the  first  occasion  they  walked  down  the  track  to  the  beach  and 
turned  south  and  walked  towards  Largs  Bay  until  they  reached  the  high  school.  
They  returned  from  the  school  walking  along  the  roadway.    On  the  second 
occasion, when they took the dog to the beach, they turned north at the end of the 
track and walked in the direction of Outer Harbor, proceeding some distance past 
the  lifesaving  shed.    However,  they  were  walking  on  the  landward  side  of  the 
high  bank  of  seaweed  and  would  not  have  been  in  a  position  to  see  Deborah's 
belongings, which were on the seaward side of the lower bank of seaweed.   

The  presence  of  diatoms  in  Deborah's  lungs  was  consistent  with  her 
 
having  drowned  in  salt  water.    The  only  particulate  matter  adhering  to  the 
mucosa  or  in  the  air  passages  were  extremely  fine  particles  of  sand.    It  was 
possible  that  she  drowned  in  a  shallow  pool  containing  water  no  more  than  a 
quarter or half an inch deep.  It was not in issue that there would have been small 
puddles  of  water  at  the  edge  of  the  seaweed  bank  and  elsewhere  on  the  beach.  
There  was  a  stain  on  the  front  of  Deborah's  jumper  which  consisted  of  sand, 
seaweed  and  foam  from  Deborah's  mouth.    If,  as  seems  likely,  the  jumper  had 
been pulled up during  the fatal attack such that it covered Deborah's mouth and 
nose,  it  would  have  acted  as  a  filter  and  explain  the  relative  absence  of  sand  in 
the  airways.    The  circumstance  that  the  back  of  the  jumper  was  relatively  dry 
compared to the front was consistent with drowning in a shallow body of water.   

 
Whatever  the  precise  mechanism  of  her  death,  it  is  implausible  that 
Deborah left Taperoo Beach with her assailant and that she drowned in salt water 
at some other location.  It is all the more implausible to contemplate in such an 
event that her killer might have returned to Taperoo Beach and buried the body at 
the  very  place  at  which  people  might  be  expected  to  be  looking  for  her.    And, 
finally,  there  is  the  location  of  Deborah's  right  boot:    20  yards  from  the  body,

against the low bank of seaweed near the sand and not far from the water.  The 
evidence  that  Deborah  was  sexually  penetrated  after  death  was  unchallenged.  
The  clear  inference  is  that  her  assailant  removed  her  right  boot,  along  with  her 
right  trouser  leg,  to  effect  his  purpose.    It  is  fanciful  to  consider  that  this  took 
place other than at Taperoo Beach and that her killer returned and deposited not 
only the body but the boot.  The prosecution established beyond reasonable doubt 
that  Deborah  drowned  on  Taperoo  Beach  in  a  location  not  far  from  where  her 
belongings were found.   

 
The strength of the fibre evidence lay in the acknowledged high degree of 
improbability that the red and black fibres found on the upper front of the singlet 
came from Deborah's tartan slacks.  It is consistent with the act of post-mortem 
sexual  intercourse  that  the  killer's  clothing  would  have  come  into  contact  with 
Deborah's singlet, given that her jumper had been pulled up over her head.  The 
strength  of  the  fibre  evidence  was  also  the  correspondence  between  the  ratio  of 
red to black fibres that were transferred to the singlet and the ratio of red to black 
fibres of which the appellant's jumper was composed.    

 
To  observe  that  Professor Horowitz'  evidence  does  not  exclude  a  time  of 
death  as  late  as  8:15pm  is  not  to  conclude  upon  a  review  of  the  whole  of  the 
evidence  that  it  was  reasonably  open  to  find  that  Deborah  died  after  4:50pm.  
Putting  Dr Manock's  evidence  to  one  side,  the  inference  is  overwhelming  that 
Deborah was dead by the time Mrs Leach looked through the front window and 
saw  Deborah's  dog  playing  by  itself.    Indeed,  bearing  in  mind  Mrs Leach's 
evidence  that  Deborah  was  always  at  home  when  she  returned  from  work,  the 
inference is that Deborah was dead by 4:40pm.   

 
Deborah  was  last  seen  alive  at  around  4:00pm  as  she  ran  towards  the 
beach.  Had she continued running in the direction in which Mrs Hazelwood and 
Mr Tajak saw her running, she would have passed the location of the appellant's 
parked car.  Her body was found 324 feet from that location.  The appellant was 
on the beach at this time and he was wearing his red and black woollen jumper.  
The  inference  of  guilt  depended  upon  all  of  the  circumstances,  but  critical  to  it 
was the conclusion that it was not reasonably possible that another man, wearing 
a  knitted  garment  made  of  red  and  black  woollen  fibres  in  approximately  the 
same  proportion  as  the  red  and  black  woollen  fibres  of  the  appellant's  jumper, 
was  present  on  Taperoo  Beach  that  afternoon,  and  that  this  other  man  killed 
Deborah.    Dr Manock's  evidence  said  nothing  as  to  this  possibility.    The 
elimination  of  Dr  Manock's  opinion  of  the  time  of  death  leaves  a  window  of 
20 minutes after the appellant left the beach and before Mrs Leach saw Deborah's 
dog  playing  alone  in  which  expert  evidence  does  not  exclude  the  fatal  assault 
taking  place.    It  does  not,  however,  significantly  reduce  the  improbability  of  a

second man, wearing a knitted garment made of red and black woollen fibres in 
approximately  the  proportion  of  the  red  and  black  woollen  fibres  of  the 
appellant's jumper, being present on this relatively deserted beach that afternoon.  
The  majority  in  the  Full  Court  were  right  to  conclude  that  there  is  not  a 
significant  possibility  that  a  properly  instructed  jury,  acting  reasonably,  would 
have acquitted the appellant had Dr Manock's erroneous opinion as to the time of 
death not been in evidence41.    

The application to reopen 

 
On  9  August  2017,  after  judgment  was  reserved,  the  appellant  filed  a 
summons seeking an order to reopen the hearing of the appeal to adduce further 
fresh evidence.  In support of that application the appellant filed affidavits sworn 
by  Allan Robert Brown, Mary Doreen Johnston and Maureen Alexina Wheeler.  
The  evidence  of  each  deponent  is  relied  on  as  further  fresh  and  compelling 
evidence within the meaning of s 353A(1) of the CLCA.   

 
In  submissions  filed  in  support  of  the  summons  on  9  August  2017,  the 
appellant  relied  on  the  dissenting  reasons  of  Deane J  in  Mickelberg  for  the 
proposition that in the interests of justice it was open to the Court to receive the 
fresh evidence42.  It is well-settled that the appellate jurisdiction of this Court is 
confined  to  appeals  in  their  true  sense  and  does  not  permit  the  Court  to  receive 
evidence which has not been considered by the Court below43.   

 
The  parties  were  informed  that  the  Court  was  minded  to  deal  with  the 
application  to  reopen  on  the  papers  and  a  timetable  was  fixed  for  the  filing  of 
written  submissions.    The  appellant  requested  that  the  Court  delay  any  final 
determination  of  his  application  until  the  respondent  answered  a  series  of 
requests for information concerning the existence of police records relating to the 
investigation.    The  respondent  opposes  the  reopening  of  the  appeal,  submitting 
that  the  Court  is  without  power  to  receive  the  further  evidence.    Moreover,  the 
respondent submits that the reliability of the evidence sought to be adduced from 
Allan Robert Brown would require to be tested by oral evidence, an exercise that

is inappropriate to be carried out by this Court44, and that the evidence sought to 
be adduced from Mary Doreen Johnston and Maureen Alexina Wheeler, even if 
accepted, is incapable of impugning the appellant's conviction.   

 
Following  the  filing  of  his  submissions  in  reply  on  the  application  to 
reopen, the appellant forwarded further written submissions to the Court on more 
than one occasion.  The filing of these submissions was outside the terms of the 
Court's  direction  and  no  regard  has  been  had  to  them.    The  appellant  does  not 
identify any arguable ground upon which this Court would depart from the long-
standing principles affirmed in Mickelberg and, more recently, in Eastman v The 
Queen45.    There  is  no  reason  to  delay  the  determination  of  the  application  to 
reopen:  this Court does not have power to receive the evidence that is the subject 
of the application.   

 
As the appellant notes, it is open to him to apply to the Full Court of the 
Supreme  Court  of  South  Australia  for  permission  to  bring  a  subsequent  appeal 
pursuant to s 353A of the CLCA.  In the circumstances, it is inappropriate to say 
anything further about the material that is the subject of the application to reopen.

6364612,R v ME [2017] NSWDC 308,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: The Court of Criminal Appeal has repeatedly emphasised that significant sentences are required in child sexual assault cases in order to protect vulnerable children from sexual exploitation. The case before me today is in my view one of the worst cases of sexual exploitation that has come before the Courts of recent times. The need to protect vulnerable children explains the sometimes harsh sentences which are imposed upon offenders and it also explains the sentence I will ultimately impose on this offender.
	
	
	The offender has pleaded guilty to three offences of aggravated sexual intercourse with a person between the ages of ten and 14. Each of those offences has a maximum penalty of 20 years with a standard non-parole period of nine years. He has pleaded guilty to an offence of inciting an aggravated act of indecency. The maximum penalty for that offence is five years with no standard non-parole period. And he has pleaded guilty to an aggravated sexual intercourse offence with a person between the ages of 14 and 16 years. The maximum penalty for that offence is 12 years with a standard non-parole period of five years.
	
	
	The circumstances of that last offence are most serious indeed, especially when the consequences for the victim of that offence are taken into account.
	
	
	The circumstance of aggravation in each case is that the offender was in a position of authority over the victim. Indeed, he was her natural father. She was living with him. Her mother was not living in Australia and so he was the only parent that she had. He groomed and then exploited his daughter for his own lustful purposes over a lengthy period.
	
	
	The victim in this matter was born in 1999. She and her mother moved to Australia when she was around the age of one. When she was about seven, with the assistance of family members, she tracked down her father, the offender, and after that she would often visit him at his apartment in the city in Sydney.
	
	
	At one stage the offender moved in with the victim and her mother. When they were home alone, the offender would show her pornography websites on a laptop computer. Matters deteriorated significantly when the victim was aged around eight or nine. It was at that stage that her mother left Australia and returned to live in her country of birth, leaving the offender as the victim’s sole custodian. They continued to live where they had been living and shared the only bed there.
	
	
	Their relationship changed in an awful way after the victim’s mother left. The offender began acting on the sexual interest he had in his daughter. The first thing that happened is that he asked her to masturbate him. The complainant says that when she was about eight or nine she was first made to masturbate the offender. That is the offence of inciting an aggravated act of indecency. This became quite a frequent activity.
	
	
	Things got even worse when the complainant turned 11. He began offering her money for sex. At around this time he first touched her genitals. He firstly put his hand on her genitals and then penetrated her vagina with his fingers. That is an offence of aggravated sexual intercourse which appears on a Form 1. Immediately after that he put his penis inside his daughter’s vagina which caused her pain. He did not use any form of birth control. That is an offence of aggravated sexual intercourse with a person between the ages of ten and 14 and is the first offence for which the offender must be specifically sentenced. It is also the offence to which all the Form 1 offences attach.
	
	
	After this the victim and the offender developed a system whereby he would pay her $50 to have sex with him. This system operated from when the victim was 11 to when she was 15 years of age. They would engage in sexual intercourse regularly; on the bed, on the computer chair and on the couch. Although the offender began to use a condom, that practice eventually ceased and their sexual intercourse was unprotected.
	
	
	At one stage when the complainant was 12 the offender performed cunnilingus upon her. That is another offence of aggravated sexual intercourse with a person between the ages of ten and 14 for which the offender must be specifically sentenced.
	
	
	Also at around that time, when the complainant was still in primary school, the offender penetrated her anus with his penis. Not surprisingly, this cause her pain. She recalled telling the offender to stop and it is some small mercy that he did so. That is the third offence of aggravated sexual intercourse with a person between the ages of ten and 14.
	
	
	The victim was silent about such matters because the offender told her not to tell anyone about the sexual activity which was taking place between them.
	
	
	In around 2010 the victim’s mother returned to Australia and she began living nearby, but this did not disturb the sleeping arrangements for the offender and his daughter.
	
	
	The sexual abuse of his daughter stopped when she was aged 15 in a most disturbing way. She fell pregnant to the offender. Together they began to research ways to induce a miscarriage, but these were not successful. Ultimately, after several weeks had passed, her pregnancy was terminated. The act of intercourse which caused that pregnancy is another act of aggravated sexual intercourse with a person between the ages of 14 and 16 on this occasion.
	
	
	Eventually, the victim told some friends about the sexual abuse committed upon her by her father. She has since told other people, a psychologist and eventually police.
	
	
	The offender was arrested on 20 October 2016 and has been in custody since that time. He made a lengthy interview with police in which he made full admissions and indeed particularised a number of other sexual acts which the police were not at that stage investigating. They all appear on the Form 1.
	
	
	To say that these offences were serious is a significant understatement. There are many aspects which aggravate these offences beyond the usual offence of child sexual assault which is serious enough in the first place.
	
	
	He had a previous sexual offence committed in 1979 when he was convicted of an offence of carnal knowledge after having sex with a 15 year old girl. The offences all occurred in the victim’s home. She was vulnerable in the extreme. As I mentioned before, she only had her father to look after her. She had nowhere else to go. These offences represent a breach of trust of the most gross form. There was planning involved, there was connivance involved and the harm which these offences have caused the offender’s daughter is conceded to be substantial.
	
	
	The consequences for the victim have been enormous. They are set out in a victim impact statement prepared by the victim’s carer. The reason the carer has prepared the victim impact is illustrative of the problems that have been caused to this unfortunate young girl. She suffers from severe emotional disturbance after giving statements in the matter and has suffered psychotic episodes in the past.
	
	
	Part of the harm, of course, comes from knowing that the person who abused her was her natural father. Although the harm she has suffered is substantial, it was entirely foreseeable. The offender can have been under no illusions as to what harm he was causing his daughter and yet he continued for years, only stopping, as I have indicated, after he made her pregnant and she had to undergo a termination.
	
	
	Returning to other ways in which these offences are to be considered as most serious ones: they followed a period of grooming; the offender even paid her to have sex with him; and the only thing that stopped these offences occurring was the victim falling pregnant. All of these offences are well into the upper range of objective seriousness. The last offence approaches the most serious form of offending covered by the offence of aggravated sexual intercourse with a child between the ages of ten and 14.
	
	
	The lengthy psychological report tendered on behalf of the offender has been of considerable assistance. In setting out the background to the offender’s crimes, as far as his childhood is concerned, the psychologist says this,
	


“Overall, Mr E reflected on his childhood and family experience in negative terms and he described having grown up being unhappy, feeling unwanted and somehow inadequate. It seems that his attachment experience was highly disturbed and in my view this set the scene for his subsequent interpersonal problems that have seen Mr E struggle with meaningful intimacy and stability in relationships in addition to also ultimately contributing to his sexually abusive behaviour.”


	
	The circumstances may perhaps in a small way explain what he did, but in no way do they excuse it.
	
	
	The psychologist also reports that the offender appears to have minimised the way in which he groomed and sexualised the victim and that his account of his motivations in offending were confused and distorted. However, when challenged, he was able to identify that his daughter was likely intimidated and coerced by him because she trusted him. The psychologist says that this bodes well for his capacity to profit from offence-focused treatment.
	
	
	Although the offender did not give evidence, I am prepared to accept that he is remorseful. He has said as much to the psychologist. He made full admissions to police and he told them of additional matters which they were not yet investigating. In order to reflect the utilitarian value of his pleas of guilty, I will impose a sentence which is 25% less that it would otherwise have been.
	
	
	When Mr Fitzgerald began his submissions to me, he emphasised that he was making many concessions on instructions from his client. These concessions were all well made. It appears that he in no way seeks to excuse his behaviour and accepts full responsibility for it. I am told that he no longer seeks to minimise the effect of his offending and, having considered the victim impact statement, accepts full responsibility for the enormous harm he has caused to his daughter.
	
	
	Mr Fitzgerald did not make any submission that I would find special circumstances in this case, understanding that an application of the statutory ratio would provide a lengthy period of eligibility for parole given the necessarily lengthy sentences which I have to impose upon his client.
	
	
	I will impose an aggregate sentence. Were it not for that circumstance, I would have imposed sentences as follows. Before imposing sentence I should note that I have taken into account both the maximum penalties and the standard non-parole periods in determining the appropriate sentence to impose upon the offender. My reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period appear in these remarks on sentence.
	
	
	Sequence 1, I would have imposed a sentence consisting of a non-parole period of six years with a head sentence of eight years. For sequence 8, a sentence of three years. For sequence 10, a non-parole period of four years with a head sentence of six years. For sequence 11, a non-parole period of five and a half years with a head sentence of seven years. For sequence 13, a non-parole period of six years with a head sentence of eight and a half years.
	
	
	Instead I impose an aggregate sentence consisting of a non-parole period of 13 and a half years with a head sentence of 18 years. The non-parole period will expire on 19 April 2030 on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole.
	
	
	The sentence will date from 20 October 2016, the day on which the offender was first arrested.

Facts

Home invasion at Woy Woy on 27 October 2015 (to be taken into account)


	
	At around 5.00pm on Tuesday 27 October 2015 Mr Ben Cornish was at his home in Woy Woy. Four friends arrived during the course of the afternoon. As the last friend was entering the house the offender pushed past him into the house. The offender indicated to those present that he intended to take their property.
	
	
	A second man then entered wearing a balaclava. He was holding a metal pole in one hand and a knife sharpener in the other. The offender said, “Righto, everybody on the floor”. He took Mr Cornish’s keys and locked the door. He then checked each of the victims’ phones to ensure they were not recording and he checked their pockets. The other offender then used electrical tape to tie each of the victims’ hands together in front of them. He took $50 from the wallet of one of them while doing so.
	
	
	The offender and his companion then searched through various rooms of the house. The offender caused Mr Cornish to open a safe in his bedroom and took $700 in cash and a carton of cigarettes. Eventually Mr Cornish told the males that they had taken everything of value and they should leave.
	
	
	At some point the offender asked which key would open a locked cabinet and when Mr Cornish told him he took a number of other items from inside it. The other offender took a number of toiletries and bottles of vitamins.
	
	
	The offender then unlocked the door and, as the two men left, the offender said, “It’s been a pleasure gentleman”. A few moments later he put his head back inside the door and said, “Don’t anybody move until we’re gone”. After the intruders left, the victims contacted the police and made statements.
	


Murder of Mr Leslie Wallace at Terrigal between 14 and 16 December 2015


	
	Mr Wallace lived at Terrigal in a house that had been converted into three separate occupancies. The downstairs area of the house was nominated Unit 1 and a granny flat was nominated Unit 2. Mr Wallace moved in to Unit 2 in mid-2015. He was 65 years old at the time.
	
	
	Mr Steven Watson was the tenant of Unit 1 until he moved out in mid-November 2015. He was a small-scale cannabis dealer.
	
	
	On 11 December 2015 Mr Wallace signed a lease for occupancy of Unit 1. He started moving his belongings into that unit over the weekend of 12-13 December. On the evening of Monday 14 December Mr Wallace’s partner, Ms Lynette Hobbs, her daughter, and her daughter’s boyfriend visited Mr Wallace in Unit 2. He showed them around Unit 1 which he was still in the process of moving into. The visitors left at around 11pm.
	
	
	Sometime between 11pm on 14 December and 2am on 15 December 2015, Ms Tamara Fenton drove the offender to the home of Mr Wallace. They were under the mistaken belief that a drug dealer still lived there. It is part of the agreed facts that they went there with the objective of entering Unit 1, threatening any occupants that may have been there, stealing property, cash and/or drugs, and using violence against any occupants if necessary.
	
	
	The offender and Ms Fenton entered Unit 1. Mr Wallace came upon them. They restrained Mr Wallace with electrical tape. The agreed facts state that “[t]he Deceased was subject to a forceful and sustained assault to the body and the head”. His property, including a laptop computer, a USB drive and a digital projector was stolen. The offender and Ms Fenton left in her car.
	


Home invasion at The Entrance on 15 December 2015 (to be taken into account)


	
	At around 7am on Tuesday 15 December 2015, Mr Frank Barrie was alone in his home at The Entrance. He heard a knock on the front door followed by a tap on his bedroom window. He opened the bedroom window and saw Ms Fenton who said, “I’m Krystal” and asked to borrow $20. Mr Barrie refused and Ms Fenton walked away. He opened his front door to see if he could see her but he could not. He went back inside, closing the screen door but leaving the wooden door open.
	
	
	After he took a few steps back into the house, Mr Barrie heard the screen door open. He turned and saw the offender holding a knife. He tried to run to his bedroom where he had a baseball bat and a cricket bat for self-defence. The offender said, “Get on the floor, get on the floor”. Mr Barrie knelt down. The offender started striking Mr Barrie repeatedly to the head, causing him to feel dazed as though he was losing consciousness. He could feel blood running down his face.
	
	
	After some time the offender left without taking anything. Mr Barrie suffered a number of injuries as a result of the attack, mainly to the head and face, the most significant of which was a 10-12cm laceration to his scalp.
	


Discovery of Mr Wallace's body and subsequent investigation


	
	A real estate agent went to Mr Wallace's home on Wednesday 16 December and found him slumped down in the kitchen of Unit 1. He appeared to be deceased. Emergency services were notified and ambulance and police officers attended.
	
	
	Mr Wallace was sitting on the kitchen floor with his shoulder against the wall and his legs out in front of him. It was confirmed that he had died. There were red marks on his wrists and ankles. Hair appeared to be missing from his left wrist. Three intertwined bundles of silver duct tape and yellow electrical tape were found in the kitchen. A kitchen knife was found resting on an open drawer and another kitchen knife was on top of the stove. A cardboard tape roll and large wooden brush were on the kitchen floor. In the agreed facts it is suggested from this evidence that Mr Wallace was conscious after the offender and Ms Fenton had left the unit and had used kitchen knives to cut himself free of the restraints.
	
	
	The offender was soon identified as a potential suspect. He and his wife, Krystal, were spoken to by police who told them that they were investigating the murder of Mr Wallace. The offender replied, “I was with Krystal all day”. He proceeded to give an exculpatory account of his movements in recent days. He denied any knowledge of the location where the murder had occurred or of the person who had formerly lived in Unit 1. The offender was arrested in respect of the aggravated break and enter that had occurred at Woy Woy (the above offence on the Form 1). Later at the police station he was also arrested in respect of the murder of Mr Wallace. He participated in a recorded interview with police, during which he denied any involvement in the murder of Mr Wallace.
	
	
	The police searched the offender’s wife’s car, where they found a backpack containing, amongst other things, disposable gloves, a roll of grey tape, a screwdriver and a box of plastic bags. They also found the stolen laptop in its carry bag, the USB drive and the digital projector.
	
	
	An autopsy was conducted upon the body of the deceased on 18 December 2015. The direct cause of death was found to be the effects of cranio-facial trauma. Injuries to the face, head, torso and arms were indicative of having been caused by a “severe assault”. Some of the head and facial injuries were distinctive or “patterned” and may have been caused by the wooden brush found on the kitchen floor. There were indications of “defence injuries” to both forearms which were considered to have been caused by blunt force trauma, such as from parrying blows from a blunt object. Two incised wounds of the right palm were also consistent with “defence” type injuries following an attack with a sharp weapon such as a knife. This was thought to indicate that Mr Wallace had incurred these injuries in an attempt to possibly parry blows or grab the blade of a sharp weapon. The head injuries included a substantial subdural haemorrhage and very extensive scalp bruising to the left side of the head, as well as bruising to the left side of the face. Such subdural haemorrhages are usually the result of significant head trauma. It was said that death would not have been instantaneous.
	
	
	Based on the number and severity of the injuries detected, the assault appeared to have been very violent and sustained, possibly over at least several minutes.
	
	
	On 24 December 2015, Ms Krystal Evans contacted police and provided further information. She said that on the weekend of 12 and 13 December 2015 she and the offender met up with Mr Joel Wrench. On 14 December the offender told her that he was going to meet up with Mr Wrench’s girlfriend, Ms Fenton. She dropped the offender at the Bateau Bay shopping centre car park where he got into Fenton’s car which Fenton was driving. She next heard from the offender at around 8am the following morning, when he called her to pick him up from the same car park. When the offender got into the car, he was carrying a black bag which he put in the back (this was the backpack which police found containing the gloves, tape, screw driver and plastic bags).
	
	
	Krystal Evans told police that on 22 December she visited the offender in custody. He had said to her, “I went there to collect money from the person that used to live there but he wasn’t there anymore. We went to leave and he tried to stop us so I tied him up. Tamara kicked him in the face and robbed him … I’m sorry all I wanted to do was get us out of here again I didn’t think that she was going to do that.”
	
	
	Ms Evans also told police that the offender wanted to speak to them. Police carried out a further interview with the offender on 30 December 2015.
	


Interview of 30 December 2015


	
	The following is the account the offender gave in the interview in relation to the murder.
	
	
	The offender said that he had seen Fenton, who he only knew as “Joel Wrench’s missus”, on the night of the murder. He went to Mr Watson's house that night. (He only knew Mr Watson by the nickname ""Santa Claus"".) Nobody was there and the doors were open to both Unit 1 and Unit 2. He walked into the unit that had a light on and “a bloke” came in behind him and wouldn’t let him back out. There was a bit of a scuffle and he kicked Mr Wallace “in the guts twice”, brought him down to the ground, and then tied him up. He then fled but Fenton attacked Mr Wallace. She then ran out from the property towards the offender and she had some items with her.
	
	
	When asked for further detail, the offender told police that he had walked inside the unit and the deceased had walked in and shut the door behind him. He kicked Mr Wallace in the stomach twice and Fenton threw him some tape which he used to tie Mr Wallace up, “only for the purpose to get away”. He said that Fenton took Mr Wallace’s bank book, bankcard and wallet.
	
	
	The offender said that he taped Mr Wallace’s arms and legs. He thought he also taped his mouth because Mr Wallace spat at him. This was in the kitchen area. He then went out to the car while Fenton remained in the house.
	
	
	The offender said that he kept the laptop and digital projector in his car intending to sell them because he did not know the deceased had died. He said that when he tied Mr Wallace up, he had no injuries except for maybe a bleeding lip. He said that he “just wanted the person that was in that house so I could get his drugs”.
	
	
	He said when they got back to the car, Fenton said, “I had to attack him”. He described Ms Fenton as having “blood all over her”.
	
	
	In relation to the home invasion at Woy Woy on 27 October 2015, the offender admitted his involvement but said there had been no forced entry; he knocked on the door and Mr Cornish said to let him in because he knew him. The co-offender followed, wearing a mask. There were four or five men inside smoking ice. The offender told the occupants to get on the ground and they initially laughed at him. He said, “get on the ground’ and they complied. He said that he took the cash and other property and nobody got hurt. He was asked if he taped them up and he said he thought he used cable ties. On that occasion he and his co-offender took pot and money. He denied that any of the victims were hurt.
	
	
	The offender was also asked about the home invasion at The Entrance on 15 December 2015. He explained that he and the victim, Mr Barrie, had a falling out and Mr Barrie owed him $300. He said that he attended Mr Barrie’s home at around 3am with Ms Fenton and got her to knock on the window and ask if he had any pot. They left after Mr Barrie said, ""No"". They returned later when it was daylight and he waited beside the door while Fenton knocked. When Mr Barrie came out through the security door the offender said, “Frankie, where’s my money or my pot?”
	
	
	The offender claimed that Mr Barrie ran inside and grabbed a knife and the offender picked up a cricket bat which happened to be there and “smashed the knife out of his hand”. He hit Mr Barrie four or five times before dropping the bat and running out of the house.
	


Telephone calls from gaol


	
	On 12 and 27 January 2016 the offender was recorded in phone calls made while he was in custody to persons known only as “Gloria” and “Pete”. He told Gloria, “The chick I was with booted him in the face and has killed the bloke after I’ve tied him up and um yeah now I’m in here”. He told Pete, “No I just tied the bloke up, she booted him in the face”.
	


Victim impact statements


	
	Victim impact statements made by Ms Lynette Hobbs (Mr Wallace's fiancé), Mr Ben Wallace and Ms Judy McPhan (his siblings) were read at the sentencing hearing. They were each succinct yet eloquent expressions of their love for Mr Wallace and the deep sense of grief they have suffered from the loss of such a vibrant, creative and generous man. I reiterate that while much of what I need to consider and discuss is concerned with the offender I have kept clearly in mind the impact that this terrible crime has had upon those left to carry the burden of heartache and despair. Again, they have my most sincere sympathy.
	


Personal circumstances and background of the offender


	
	A number of documents detailing aspects of the offender's background and personal circumstances were tendered at the sentence hearing. The offender gave evidence as well.
	


Report of Ms Lisa Zipparo, clinical neuropsychologist


	
	The following is an account of his life the offender gave to Ms Lisa Zipparo, clinical neuropsychologist. He was born in Newcastle and grew up in that area with his mother and sister. He described his upbringing until the age of 9 as being “relatively normal”. At that time his mother moved in with a new boyfriend who was described as a steroid abuser and bodybuilder. The offender described this man as violent and sadistic towards him. He said that his mother was aware of the beatings he received at the hands of this man and she sanctioned them. As a result, he expressed a deep sense of betrayal by her because he could not understand why she allowed these beatings to occur. Also, at the age of 9 his stepfather’s brother began to sexually abuse him. At the age of 10 his neighbour also began to sexually abuse him. At the age of 12 he became weary of the physical and sexual abuse and ran away from home and began living on the streets. He said that his mother never attempted to find him or help him in any way. He had no further contact with her or his sister after he left home.
	
	
	The offender described his life from that point as one of “survival” on the streets. He slept in “Salvo bins”, ate out of rubbish bins and learned to steal to survive. At one point during his homelessness he lived in an Aboriginal mission in Newcastle, but said that this was not a safe environment. He was provided with shelter and small amounts of food but he described having to sleep with four other people in a single bed. He said he was subjected to sexual and physical abuse because he was regarded as a “fair skinned Aboriginal”. He received regular bashings and on one occasion was raped by a group of five men in the toilets at the mission. Alcoholism and drug abuse were rife.
	
	
	The offender returned to living on the streets. He committed petty crimes and allowed himself to get caught by police just so he could have a meal and a dry place to sleep for a few nights. He described his time spent in juvenile detention facilities as a form of respite from the dangers of living on the streets.
	
	
	The offender said that the only positive event that he could recall since those early years was meeting his wife Krystal ten years ago. They have been married now for five years. He described a deep sense of responsibility for her wellbeing and was “gutted” that he was unable to look after her properly. He said that his only focus and motivation was getting some positive life skills so that he could return to live with his wife and have a normal healthy existence with her. She is his only family; he has no contact with family members and no real friendships. He told Ms Zipparo that he was largely “isolated” and “alone” except for his wife.
	
	
	The offender told Ms Zipparo that he had “a lot of trouble with school work” and did not learn to read and write until he was an adult when his wife taught him. He told her that he left school in Year 7 shortly after he started living on the streets and never returned to any formal education. However, he agreed in cross-examination by the Crown Prosecutor that he had engaged in Year 10 studies at TAFE but he left before attaining a School Certificate. He also agreed that he had attained a number of vocational training certificates whilst incarcerated, such as a Certificate III in Building Construction, Senior First Aid, and a Green Card enabling him to work on building sites.
	
	
	The offender also said that he had never really had a “proper job”. He had some short-term work experiences but it seems there was nothing of any long-term nature. He told Ms Zipparo that he would “try very hard to do the right thing” but he felt circumstances always transpired against him and would find himself reverting to “old habits” such as robberies “to make ends meet”. He told Ms Zipparo that he sometimes did not “even realise it was wrong” as this is how he had survived since the age of 9.
	
	
	Substance abuse has been a major issue in the offender’s life. He started smoking marijuana at the age of 9 and started using heroin at the age of 15. He started using ice from the age of 21 and the report states that he continued to do so until his arrest for the present matter. (I note in the police interview of 30 December 2015 the offender said that at the time of the offences he was using marijuana, not ice.)
	
	
	Ms Zipparo administered a number of neuropsychological tests and she summarised the results as follows:
	


“Cognitive testing showed Mr Evans is functioning at a low level across most cognitive domains. Mr Evans has general intellectual abilities in the Extremely Low range, commensurate with a Mild intellectual disability. There is some evidence that he may have been functioning at this level from childhood given the self-reported difficulties in learning to read and write. However, the compounding effects of long-term poly-drug use and of a significant mood disorder upon cognitive functioning also need to be considered.”


	
	Ms Zipparo’s clinical opinion is:
	


“Mr Evans’ background of childhood trauma and abuse, his deep sense of abandonment and betrayal by his primary caregiver, his complex psychiatric history, and his long term drug abuse and dependency are highly suggestive of a presentation of Complex Trauma. This term describes the long term impact on brain development when a young child is exposed to repeated trauma. Early and repeated childhood trauma can result in interference in normal brain development resulting in devastating effects on a child’s emotions, ability to think, learn, and concentrate, impulse control, self-image, and relationships with others. Complex trauma is linked to a wide range of problems in adulthood, including those described by Mr Evans, such as addiction, depression and anxiety, self-harming behaviours and other psychiatric disorders.

Mr Evans displayed some considerable difficulties with executive function tasks. Executive dysfunction is a neuropsychological impairment of particular note in trauma victims, and is consistent with abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex which have been observed in sufferers of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder [citation of literature omitted]. Executive dysfunction is a problem of particular concern with regard to offending behaviour given that it can significantly impair impulse control, control of aggression and the ability to make good decisions. It is therefore highly likely that Mr Evans’ trauma background and the devastating impact this has likely had on his psychological wellbeing and cognitive abilities has contributed to his offending behaviour.”


	
	Ms Zipparo’s report concludes with recommendations as to various means by which the offender can undertake a successful rehabilitation. They comprised that he undertake trauma counselling with an experienced trauma counsellor who understands the difficult and pervasive nature of complex trauma; a long-term residential drug rehabilitation program which incorporates trauma counselling as part of the treatment plan; training and learning vocational skills with sensitivity to the offender’s significant cognitive limitations; and a review of his current medication regime.
	


Letter from Ms Renee Napier, clinical and forensic psychologist


	
	A letter by Ms Renee Napier, clinical and forensic psychologist, confirmed that the offender had attended 10 sessions with her from April to September 2015. He had been referred by his general practitioner for treatment of the previous diagnosis of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, depression and anxiety. He was also specifically referred for treatment of the effects of childhood sexual abuse. My impression from the letter is that Ms Napier was only able to begin examining the offender’s psychological issues. For example, she noted that they did not examine childhood sexual abuse in detail. Ms Napier was also of the view that the offender’s “presentation clearly indicated complex trauma”. She wrote that he “was in clear need of long term assistance”.
	


Letter by the offender


	
	A letter by the offender provided further illustrations of his troubled life experiences. Much of this has been described earlier but the letter added that at the age of 15, when he was living on the streets, he met and was taken in by an older man called Ian who was ""an ex con"". Ian gave him his first shot of heroin. Thereafter Ian gave him heroin daily and ""made"" him commit armed robberies during the year they were together.
	
	
	The offender said that he then moved in with a friend and was stable for a couple of months. However, he claimed that he and the friend were living in a tent and he was raped by his friend's mother in the tent. He also blamed the friend's mother for introducing him to ice. He said that he was given the drug daily and became dependent upon it. He said that his life had “been one of taking drugs and doing crime to feed [his] habit”. He tried to give up drugs at times but found it too hard.
	
	
	The offender also described in the letter how in October-December 2015 he and his wife were planning on moving away from the Central Coast and finding a new home in Queensland. He said he was withdrawing from drugs and was ""in a lot of pain and not thinking straight"".
	
	
	The offender conceded that he had continued using drugs from time to time since returning to gaol. He knows he needs intensive counselling and engagement in programs. He said he had been seeing a psychologist and a psychiatrist and had been prescribed medication, including anti-psychotic drugs. He described his former life as a ""mess""; he had hurt so many people. He said ""my life is shit"". However, he claimed to have made progress as a result of the counselling and medication, and he was motivated to continue in that vein. He wrote, ""I am determined to continue with the psych's counselling and medication for my psych and drug problems. It is the first time I've seen a psych to get on medication I am feeling so much better and I have hope for the first time in my life and if I work very hard I would be able to come out the other end"". Similar sentiments were expressed in the offender's oral evidence.
	


Character reference


	
	A letter from Mr Bill Dimovski, a congregation elder with the Jehovah's Witnesses confirmed the involvement of the offender in Bible Studies at Long Bay for the past three months. He had noticed an improvement in the offender's demeanour and outlook on life during that time. He wrote that the studies ""have helped him see the seriousness of his past actions and [he] has indicated his strong desire not to repeat these again.""
	


Pre-Sentence Report


	
	The offender's most recent contact with Community Corrections was when he was on parole from November 2014 until May 2015, during which time he made ""significant progress"" and ""appeared to be leading a more pro-social lifestyle"". The assessment of the author, Mr Chris Baker, Community Corrections Officer, was stated as follows:
	


""Mr Evans had an unenviable upbringing, developing few life skills. His use of alcohol and illicit drugs has made matters worse for him, and although acknowledging in the past that he would be assisted by entering a long term rehabilitation program, this did not eventuate. It is unfortunate that following a period of relative stability, at a time when he was getting clinical psychological intervention and planning a move away from the Central Coast to start a new life, he again resumed illicit drug use and committed the aforementioned offences.""


	
	According to an actuarial risk/needs assessment tool, Mr Baker assessed the offender as presenting ""a High risk of re-offending"". His identified criminogenic needs are:
	



	
	Education/employment
	
	
	Alcohol/drug problems
	
	
	Emotional/personal
	


Criminal history


	
	The offender's criminal history includes offences committed when he was aged 15 to 17 which were dealt with in the Children's Court. They included offences of damaging property, contravening apprehended domestic violence orders, assaults, multiple robberies including an aggravated robbery, and break and enters. Regular offending has continued throughout the offender's adult years, the more significant of which are set out in the following table:

	The offender has been in gaol for more than eight years in broken periods since the beginning of 2005. His custodial history lists a considerable number of correctional centre punishments, many of them related to drugs (e.g. possess drug implements; failing a drug test).
	


Objective seriousness assessment


	
	It is necessary for me to make an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence.
	
	
	It is important to recognise that in making this assessment before I can take into account a matter that is adverse to the offender the matter has to be proved to the standard of beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	Since the sentencing hearing last Monday I have heard evidence in the first two days of the trial of Ms Fenton. I have heard some things about the offender and about Ms Fenton that would bear upon the credibility of the versions they have given in their police interviews. However, I am unable to take into account evidence in the trial of Ms Fenton because it is not evidence in the sentencing proceedings for the offender. For that reason I am required to put that evidence completely out of my mind.
	
	
	Confining myself to the evidence in the sentence proceedings, there is reason to suspect that it was the offender who inflicted the fatal violence upon Mr Wallace. However, the only evidence that directly suggests this is the transcript of what Ms Fenton told the police. I have not heard her give evidence of that version and the offender's counsel has not had the opportunity to cross-examine and test her credibility. In other words, I have no basis to say that I believe her version in preference to that given by the offender in his police interview. In these circumstances, it is not possible for me to accept Ms Fenton's version beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	Based upon the evidence that is able to be taken into account, the Crown submitted that the murder of Mr Wallace is an offence that ""falls at least in the mid-range"" while counsel for the offender submitted that it ""falls below the mid-range"".
	
	
	The offence involved not one, but two, offenders carrying out a premeditated invasion of Mr Wallace's home in the middle of the night; a place where he was entitled to safety and security. The injuries he sustained are indicative of there having been a particularly savage and brutal assault, possibly with the impromptu use of one or more items found in the vicinity as weapons. He was left bound and gagged but died some short period of time after managing to free himself from his restraints.
	
	
	The crime amounts to murder on the basis that the killing occurred in the course of the offender being a party to a joint criminal enterprise to detain Mr Wallace with the intention of stealing property with the offenders being in company and actual bodily harm being inflicted.
	
	
	The offender admits to having initiated the violence and to having bound Mr Wallace's mouth, wrists and ankles, but he blames Ms Fenton for the violence that caused death. It was accepted that I would be unable to determine the truth or otherwise of that claim. It was realistically conceded by his counsel that on the limited evidence before me I should approach the matter on the basis that the offender's liability is indistinguishable from that of Ms Fenton.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the offence falls in the mid-range of objective seriousness in the very wide range of circumstances in which the crime of murder may be committed.
	


Assistance to authorities


	
	The offender has undertaken to give evidence for the prosecution in the trial of Ms Fenton. He signed a statement on 10 August 2017 in which he asserted that what he said in his interview with police on 30 December 2015 is true and is the evidence he would be prepared to give in court. He confirmed this in his oral evidence.
	
	
	There are a number of matters that I must consider in determining the degree to which the offender's assistance to authorities might be taken into account in his favour on sentence.
	
	
	It was contended by the Crown, seemingly based upon a statement by a Detective Senior Constable Fuchs which is part of Exhibit A, that the significance and usefulness of the assistance is limited. This was said to be so because the co-accused Ms Fenton had participated in an interview with police on 24 February 2016 in which she admitted to being part of a joint criminal enterprise to carry out the home invasions at the two premises.
	
	
	A transcript of that interview is before me as part of Exhibit A. On my reading of it, the overall effect is that Ms Fenton categorically denied any involvement in a joint criminal enterprise to carry out home invasions. She gave an account which was to the effect that she had agreed to provide transport for the offender who directed her to the homes of the two victims. But the offending that occurred at those two locations was not something that she foresaw, let alone something that she was a party to.
	
	
	As to the truthfulness, completeness and reliability of the offender's version I am unable to make a determination. The offender’s history of violence in the past gives reason to suspect that he was involved in more of the violent conduct toward Mr Wallace than he has admitted. However, on the assumption his version is accepted by the jury, his evidence could be important in proving that Ms Fenton was a party to the joint criminal enterprise to carry out home invasions alleged by the Crown.
	
	
	The timeliness of the offender's assistance is not particularly significant aside from the fact that it was made sufficiently in advance of the impending trial of Ms Fenton.
	
	
	There is no suggestion of the offender having received any benefits as a result of offering his assistance, that he will suffer harsher custodial conditions or that he or his family are at risk of injury as a consequence.
	
	
	I am required to ensure that any reduction of the offender's sentence on account of his assistance to authorities does not render the sentence disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence. I am also required to indicate the extent of any reduction for past or future assistance. Given what he has done to date is of no value unless and until he fulfils his undertaking to give evidence, I propose to apportion all of the reduction to future assistance.
	
	
	The reduction of the offender's sentence on account of his offer to give evidence for the prosecution in the trial of his alleged co-offender will be 15 per cent (as opposed to the 10 per cent suggested by counsel for the offender).
	


Other matters bearing upon the assessment of sentence

Form 1 offences


	
	The need to take into account the additional offences listed on the Form 1 document is an important matter in the assessment of sentence because they are each quite serious offences in their own right. They call for a significant increase in the penalty to be imposed (although I am mindful of the principle of totality).
	


Intellectual capacity, mental condition and background of abuse


	
	The offender's background of significant physical, sexual and psychological abuse in his childhood and teenage years provides in very large measure an explanation for his involvement in substance abuse and criminal offending from an early age, as well as for the fact that they have been enduring features of his life. His moral culpability for his offending is less than it otherwise would be on this account. It is also reduced on account of his low intellectual abilities and the condition of Complex Trauma. For these reasons there should be less emphasis given to general deterrence, retribution and denunciation in sentencing. A feature which is countervailing to some extent, is that his history of regular offending over the years, which includes violent offending, means that there must be particular emphasis upon personal deterrence and protection of the community in the assessment of sentence.
	


Mitigation for plea of guilty


	
	The offender's plea of guilty came after charge negotiations which resulted in the two other serious offences being taken into account rather than the subject of separate and additional sentences. The plea was entered a little over a year and a half after he was charged, 6 months after having been committed for trial, 4 months after having entered pleas of not guilty on arraignment but 2 months before the date fixed for trial. A reduction of 10 per cent will be allowed for the utilitarian benefit to the criminal justice system flowing from the plea.
	


Remorse


	
	The offender expressed remorse in his letter and in his oral evidence but an assessment of whether this is genuine is problematic. Clearly, he has low intellectual abilities with the consequence that he may not be as articulate as others in expressing his thoughts and feelings. It is appropriate to make an allowance for this.
	
	
	However, I have some misgivings about his credibility. There is the question of the truthfulness and completeness of the account he gave to police in his interview of 30 December 2015 in which he attributed the blame for Mr Wallace's death almost entirely upon Ms Fenton.
	
	
	A question also arises about the credibility of the evidence the offender gave in the sentence hearing. In cross-examination by the Crown Prosecutor the offender was asked about his account of having kicked Mr Wallace. A proposition was put that he is a very strong man but he responded by saying, ""Not at the time"" and volunteered that he was only 70 or 75 kg in weight. That was wrong. He told the police in his police interview of 30 December 2015 that he had no reason to use a weapon in the Woy Woy home invasion because he was ""a big boy""; he was ""98 kilos""; ""pretty muscley"". He said that ""I can scare people with my muscles, with my, with intimidation with the size of me"".
	
	
	In further submissions on this point, counsel for the offender proferred the explanation that when giving his evidence the offender was unaware of his actual weight but relied upon that which was recorded in his police criminal history document which shows his weight range as ""75kg – 80kg"". I do not accept that explanation. There was no equivocation or doubt in his evidence, let alone a suggestion that he did know but relied upon a police document. Moreover, the prosecutor was only asking the offender about his strength; it was the offender who raised the issue of his weight. Putting aside his weight, his denial that he was ""a very strong man"" is itself contradicted by what he had told police.
	
	
	There is also an issue about whether he minimised his educational and employment history in what he told Ms Zipparo.
	
	
	It might be that the offender is remorseful and I will allow him some credit for that. It must be said, however, that with reason to be sceptical about his credibility, I am not entirely convinced that it is completely genuine.
	


Prospects of rehabilitation


	
	The offender's prospects of rehabilitation are very difficult to gauge. Counsel for the offender argued that ""there is a glimmer of hope"" (T20.41). The offender’s statements do indicate motivation to engage in rehabilitation and medication appears to be assisting him. However, whether he is able to carry through with his stated intentions is uncertain in light of his history. I note from the custodial record that he continues with disciplinary infractions in gaol; in the last six months he has four entries related to drugs and alcohol.
	


Special circumstances


	
	It was submitted that I should find special circumstances so as to reduce the proportion of the sentence represented by the non-parole period. There are substantial bases for making this finding (see written submissions for the offender at [59]). However, it is also necessary to ensure that the non-parole period provides an adequate reflection of the seriousness of the offence. In the end I consider that the imposition of a sentence bearing the usual proportions will provide an adequate period for potential parole supervision to further facilitate the offender's rehabilitation.
	


Credit for pre-sentence custody


	
	The offender is entitled to have taken into account the time he has been in custody since his arrest. The sentence will be backdated to 16 December 2015 for that reason.
	


Sentence


	
	Convicted.
	


The offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 18 years and balance of the term of the sentence of 6 years. The sentence is to date from 16 December 2015 so the offender will become eligible for release on parole after the expiry of the non-parole period on 15 December 2033.

That is a total sentence of 24 years. Without the offender's plea of guilty and assistance to authorities it would have been a sentence of 32 years. The amount of reduction for the assistance alone is just under 5 years.

6428882,Mousa v Roads and Maritime Services [2017] NSWCATOD 162,"REASONS FOR DECISION


	
	This is an application by Mr Michael Mousa for review of a decision cancelling his authorisation to drive private hire vehicles. His authorisation was cancelled by Roads and Maritime Services (RMS) because RMS could not attest that Mr Mousa is of good repute and in all other respects a fit and proper person to be the driver of a private hire vehicle.
	


The legislation


	
	Section 40 of the Passenger Transport Act 1990 (the Act) relevantly provides:
	


40   Authorities

(1) RMS may, by the issue of authorities under this Division, authorise persons to drive private hire vehicles, subject to and in accordance with this Division. A person authorised under this Division is referred to in this Part as an “authorised private hire vehicle driver”.

(2) A person who drives a private hire vehicle is guilty of an offence unless the person is an authorised private hire vehicle driver.

Maximum penalty: 100 penalty units.

(3) The purpose of an authority under this Division is to attest:

(a)  that the authorised person is considered to be of good repute and in all other respects a fit and proper person to be the driver of a private hire vehicle, and

(b)  that the authorised person is considered to have sufficient responsibility and aptitude to drive a private hire vehicle:

(i)  in accordance with the conditions under which the private hire vehicle service concerned is operated, and

(ii)  in accordance with law and custom.


	
	Section 40E of the Act provides:
	


Having regard to the purposes of authorisation under this division, RMS may at any time vary, suspend or cancel any person’s authority under this Division.


	
	The issue in this case is whether the Tribunal can attest that Mr Mousa is considered to be of good repute and in all other respects a fit and proper person to be the driver of a private hire vehicle.
	


Background


	
	Mr Mousa has held an authority to drive private hire vehicles since about 2000. Prior to that he drove taxis for five or so years. He has a wife and five children, two of whom still live at home, and he is the sole income earner in his family.
	
	
	On 28 April 2016 Mr Mousa was charged with two counts of “assault with act of indecency” in relation to an incident involving a passenger while he was on duty as a private hire vehicle driver. He was found guilty in the Local Court, convicted and directed to enter into a good behaviour bond for a period of two years.
	
	
	On appeal to the District Court, Mr Mousa was found guilty of the offence. No conviction was recorded and he was ordered to enter into a good behaviour bond for a period of two years under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	The facts surrounding the offence for which Mr Mousa was found guilty involve him making unwarranted remarks about sex to a female passenger, grabbing her hand, hugging her and kissing her on the cheeks and lips.
	
	
	Mr Mousa’s authority was cancelled on 8 May 2017, a decision which was affirmed on internal review on 10 July 2017. The respondent had formed the view that Mr Mousa is not of good repute to drive private hire vehicles because he was found guilty of indecent assault.
	


The applicant’s case


	
	Mr Mousa told the Tribunal that the incident didn’t happen the way his passenger had described. He stated that, if there was an investigation, CCTV footage would show this. He also said that it would never happen again.
	
	
	Mr Mousa said that he has been driving for 22 and a half years and has a good record. He is most concerned for his family and his financial situation. He said that, because he can’t work, he has accumulated debts and can’t pay the rent. He wants to be able to resume his occupation and support his family.
	
	
	Mr Mousa was represented by a solicitor in these proceedings but the solicitor did not accompany him to the hearing. The solicitor had previously noted that, on appeal, the District Court had reduced Mr Mousa’s sentence to a s 10 bond. The solicitor stated that Mr Mousa has not breached the bond and, by dealing with the matter by way of s 10, the Court had reflected the trivial nature of the offence.
	


The respondent’s case


	
	RMS points out that both the Local Court and District Court found Mr Mousa guilty of the offences, although no conviction has been recorded against Mr Mousa and he has received a s 10 bond. RMS acknowledges that the actions of Mr Mousa fall at the lower end of what is encompassed with the offence of “assault with act of indecency”. However, the offence occurred during the course of Mr Mousa performing his duties as a private hire vehicle driver and involved a vulnerable female passenger.
	
	
	RMS submitted that, in the context of Mr Mousa’s occupation, his actions were serious and simply not appropriate and that it does not matter that, in the criminal proceedings, he received a s 10 bond. The respondent noted that Mr Mousa has provided no references from persons able to attest to his good repute.
	
	
	RMS referred to a number of cases involving criminal convictions which have been decided by this Tribunal and these are discussed below.
	


Good repute and fit and proper


	
	At issue is whether the Tribunal can “attest” that Mr Mousa is of good repute and in all other respects a fit and proper person to be a private hire vehicle driver. Most of the decided cases have dealt with an authority under s 33 of the Act to be a taxi-cab driver. The provision in s 33 is identical to that in s 40 of the Act relating to drivers of private hire vehicles and the cases are therefore apposite.
	
	
	In Director General, Transport New South Wales v AIC [2011] NSWADTAP 65 the Appeal Panel stated at [12] that by using the word “attest” the Parliament has sought “to emphasis the idea that the conferral of an authority involves a declaration of public trust”.
	
	
	The Appeal Panel went on to say that the expression “good repute and in all other respects a fit and proper person” is meant “to be expansive in scope allowing for a broad range of personal attributes to be assessed, and for consideration to be given to the person’s general standing in the community, especially among those who know the person well and are fully informed as to any matters of concern”. The Panel then discussed the concepts of “good repute” and “fit and proper” (at [13]): “repute” goes to the public estimation of the person while “fit and proper” goes to such matters of character “as to whether the applicant is possessed of sufficient moral integrity and rectitude of character as to permit him or her to be safely accredited to the public without further inquiry”.
	
	
	In Re T and the Director of Youth and Community Services [1980] 1 NSDWLR 392 Wadell J stated when discussing the meaning of “good repute”:
	


A person's reputation, in fact and in law, is to be found in the estimate of his moral character entertained by some specific group of people, such as those who live in the neighbourhood of his residence, those who work with him or those with whom he associates in his occupation or profession . . . Evidence of conviction for a criminal offence is, however, admissible as evidence, indeed, most cogent evidence of bad reputation.


	
	A criminal history is not, however, of itself evidence of bad repute, but does create a presumption that the person has, among those who know of that history, a bad reputation. It puts the onus on the person to establish their good reputation: Loye v Director General, Department of Transport [2000] NSWADT 145 at [29].
	
	
	In Saadieh v Director-General, Department of Transport [1999] NSWADT 68 at [17], in the context of a taxi licence, the Tribunal identified factors relevant to fitness and propriety as including:
	



	
	the nature, seriousness and frequency of any criminal offences for which the applicant has been arrested or convicted;
	
	
	the applicant’s reputation in the community; and
	
	
	the likelihood that the applicant will reoffend, be the subject of further complaints or commit further offences.
	



	
	In Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 388 Toohey and Gaudron JJ said:
	


The question whether a person is fit and proper is one of value judgment. In that process the seriousness or otherwise of particular conduct is a matter for evaluation by the decision maker. So too is the weight, if any, to be given to matters favouring the person whose fitness and propriety are under consideration.

Consideration


	
	Mr Mousa has not been convicted of the offence of indecent assault. He has, however, been found guilty of that offence. His guilt was arrived at by a court after the assessment of all the evidence. As with a conviction, a finding of guilt will raise a question to be answered concerning the person’s reputation (see Barrett v Director General, Department of Transport [2000] NSWADT 183 at 31).
	
	
	The only evidence before the Tribunal is the evidence of the indecent assault as set out in the Police Facts Sheet and the subsequent finding by the court of Mr Mousa’s guilt. While I accept that the offence was not viewed by the court as being at the most serious end of the spectrum of such offences, given the context within which the offence occurred it is, nevertheless, serious. In my view, Mr Mousa’s behaviour towards his passenger was entirely inappropriate and goes directly to his suitability to hold an authorisation. A passenger in a private hire vehicle is entitled to expect that they will be treated with respect and courtesy and not be subjected to unwarranted and unwanted sexual advances or innuendo.
	
	
	It does not appear that Mr Mousa has a history of such behaviour and I note his statement that it will not happen again. However, Mr Mousa has not provided any evidence of his general reputation in the community which would indicate that he has a good reputation among those who know him. Of most concern is that he appears to dispute he was guilty of the alleged behaviour. It is not open to Mr Mousa in these proceedings to now put forward an alternative view of the evidence or to imply that he is not guilty of the offence.
	
	
	I am sure that the cancellation of the authority has had a detrimental effect upon Mr Mousa’s financial situation. However, as was stated in Lal v Director General, Department of Transport 2011 NSWADT 74, hardship to Mr Mousa is not a factor which the Tribunal can take into account in determining whether or not the respondent has made the correct and preferable decision.
	
	
	On balance, I am not satisfied as to Mr Mousa’s current good reputation or that he is a fit and proper person to hold a private hire vehicle driver authority.

The decision under review is affirmed.

	The Jenkins Family Trust (the Trust) was established in 2004. CRS and Mr Jenkins were appointed as the trustees and beneficiaries of the Trust in 2008.
	
	
	At all material times Mr Jenkins was a trustee and beneficiary of the Trust.
	
	
	At all material times CRS conducted a business or undertaking which involved the laying of asphalt and bitumen surfaces on driveways, roads and car parks.
	
	
	At all material times CRS owned and/or operated a Paveline Autopatch bitumen road sealing Isuzu truck (Autopatch Vehicle). The Vehicle’s registration number was XPB-473 and the Vehicle was fitted with a Paveline Autopatch bitumen road sealing unit.
	
	
	The Autopatch Vehicle was purchased by CRS from Paveline International Pty Ltd (ACN: 098 409 333) (Paveline) in 2009. Paveline is a manufacturer of road maintenance equipment.
	
	
	At all material times CRS had been engaged by the owner of the premises at 44A Plumpton Road, Tatton, Wagga Wagga NSW (the Work Site), to undertake work in the form of laying bitumen to seal a driveway.
	
	
	James Ferrario, Joel Passlow, Joshua Johnson, Damien Frasier and Anthony Dibicarri were engaged by CRS as workers undertaking work at the work site (Work Crew).
	
	
	At all material times, Mr Pollard, the injured person, was employed by Everything Outdoors Wagga Wagga NSW Pty Limited (ABN: 23115 023017) (Everything Outdoors).
	


THE INCIDENT


	
	On 1 July 2015, Mr Jenkins and the Work Crew were using the Autopatch Vehicle to seal the driveway at the Work Site. The Autopatch Vehicle had a main steel feeder delivery line which was being used to spray a cold bitumen emulsion onto the driveway.
	
	
	At around 1.15 pm, Mr Jenkins and the Work Crew commenced the task of sealing the driveway at the Work Site. However, the bitumen emulsion had solidified because it had cooled down and had blocked the lines as a result of the cold weather.
	
	
	Mr Jenkins made a decision to heat a part of the Autopatch Vehicle so the bitumen emulsion would soften and flow out of the lines. To do so Mr Jenkins moved to a location on the driver’s side of the Autopatch Vehicle behind the Vehicle’s cabin.
	
	
	The emulsion tank was located behind the Autopatch Vehicle’s cabin. On the drivers’ side of the Autopatch Vehicle behind the Vehicle’s cabin there were lines, including the main steel feeder delivery line and spray bar lines. There were also a series of tanks, including a pressurised air tank and a pressurised tank that was filled with kerosene. In and around the lines and tanks there were a series of electrical cables and flexible plastic tubing and hoses. The flexible plastic tubing and hoses included compressed air lines and flexible pipes used for the kerosene system.
	
	
	Mr Jenkins used a handheld LPG open flame gas torch that was connected to an LPG gas cylinder to heat a part of the Autopatch Vehicle. While doing so Mr Jenkins was standing on the driver’s side of the Autopatch Vehicle behind the Vehicle’s cabin and in the vicinity of the feeder lines, pressurised tanks, and pressurised flexible hoses.
	
	
	On the same date, Mr Pollard, as part of his employment, was carrying out pool maintenance at a property adjacent to the Work Site.
	
	
	At approximately 1.30 pm, Mr Pollard walked over to Mr Jenkins from the adjacent property. There was some discussion between Mr Jenkins and Mr Pollard which took place on the driver’s side of the Autopatch Vehicle behind the Vehicle’s cabin. Mr Pollard spoke with Mr Jenkins for a few minutes.
	
	
	During the discussion the Autopatch Vehicle was operating, the compressed air lines and flexible pipes used for the kerosene system were pressurised and Mr Jenkins continued using the handheld LPG open gas flame gas torch that was connected to a LPG gas cylinder to heat a part of the Autopatch Vehicle.
	
	
	After the discussion had finished Mr Pollard started to walk towards the adjacent property.
	
	
	At this time, there was an explosion and a fireball which came from the Autopatch Vehicle. Mr Jenkins had been heating a part of the Autopatch Vehicle which was proximate to pipelines that contained kerosene and bitumen emulsion. In that same area there were also pressurized air pipelines which had been cleaned with kerosene. The pressurised air pipelines and the flexible pipes used for the kerosene system ruptured. This led to a mixture of kerosene and pressurised air coming into contact with heat from the gas torch flame, causing the explosion and fireball.
	
	
	At the time of the explosion, Mr Pollard was approximately 5 metres away from the rear of the Autopatch Vehicle when he was engulfed by the explosion and fireball.
	
	
	Mr Pollard sustained serious injuries and was admitted to Wagga Wagga Hospital and was then transferred to the Intensive Care Unit at Concord Hospital.
	
	
	Mr Jenkins sustained minor burns as he was standing on the right hand side of the Autopatch Vehicle at the rear of the cabin when the explosion occurred. Mr Jenkins was taken to Wagga Wagga Hospital for treatment. Mr Jenkins has recovered to some extent from his injuries and has returned to work.
	
	
	The Vehicle had only been in operation for about 15 minutes before the incident occurred.
	


INJURIES AND AFTERMATH


	
	On 1 July 2015, Mr Pollard was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit at Concord Hospital where he underwent immediate surgery including debridement and split skin grafting. He was placed in an induced coma for approximately two weeks. Mr Pollard sustained burns to 35% of his body, including his face, neck, hands and legs.
	
	
	Mr Pollard was not discharged from hospital until 27 July 2015. Mr Pollard stayed at a serviced apartment that was close to the outpatient department of the hospital so he could attend hospital on a daily basis to have the dressings to his burns changed regularly.
	
	
	Mr Pollard’s recovery was slow with ongoing medical treatment required. Mr Pollard has permanent scarring to his legs and hands as a result of the burns. He also developed contractures which is a condition of shortening and hardening of muscles, tendons, or other tissue which leads to the rigidity of joints. Mr Pollard therefore has difficulty walking and has to bend his knees when he walks due to the contractures. His fingers are also affected by contractures and he has suffered a significant loss of movement in his hands.
	
	
	Mr Pollard has not returned to work full time in his family business. He continues to receive treatment for his injuries and has to undertake extensive physiotherapy in order to maintain movement in his joints. He also has difficulty maintaining his body temperature as a result of the burns.
	
	
	Mr Pollard was 47 years of age at the time of the incident and the injuries he sustained were a manifestation of the risk.
	


THE PLANT


	
	The Plant was a Paveline Autopatch bitumen road sealing Isuzu truck.
	
	
	The Plant was located at the Work Site.
	
	
	The Autopatch Vehicle was fitted with a tank marked ‘water’ which operated under air pressure.
	
	
	The design of the Autopatch Vehicle incorporated an air purging system for the cleaning of the emulsion pipelines. The air purging process was designed to obviate the need to use flammable cleaning substances, such as kerosene, to clean the pipelines. The system is operated from the side of the Vehicle.
	
	
	The design of the Autopatch unit also had an integrated heating process for the pipelines, which involved running the heated water from the vehicle’s radiator though the pipelines.
	
	
	The product used in the emulsion tank was a cold mix which did not have to be externally heated before use.
	
	
	Mounted on the rear of the plant was a manually operated emulsion hose and lance routinely used for the spraying of bitumen.
	


History of the plant


	
	The Paveline Autopatch Vehicle was originally designed and manufactured for Wellington Shire Council as part of a tender process in 2000.
	
	
	In 2009, Wellington Shire Council traded in the Autopatch Vehicle to Paveline. The Council had made no modifications to the Autopatch Vehicle.
	
	
	After the Vehicle was traded in by Wellington Shire Council, Paveline changed the delivery hoses and distributor parts to ‘as new' condition and checked the Autopatch unit for safety, security and structural integrity.
	
	
	On 10 November 2009 Paveline sold the Autopatch Vehicle to CRS. The Autopatch Vehicle sold to CRS had a water tank. The invoices Paveline issued to CRS at the time of the sale included those for a solution, accessories and spare parts. The solution was one litre of green emulsion plant cleaner. This was a water-based solution that was to be used when cleaning the pipelines of the Autopatch Vehicle. This solution should have been used to clean the pipelines of the Autopatch Vehicle.
	


Modifications made by Mr Jenkins to Autopatch Unit of the Autopatch Vehicle


	
	CRS made modifications to the Autopatch unit of the Autopatch Vehicle. The water tank was modified to be used as a tank to store kerosene. The tap apparatus was removed and a hose was fitted to the outlet end of the water tank.
	
	
	The modifications were made to the water tank so that kerosene could be used to flush out the emulsion pipelines of the Autopatch Vehicle. This was contrary to the design of the Autopatch Vehicle. The water tank was designed to hold water only.
	
	
	Mr Jenkins had directed that the modifications be made to the Autopatch Vehicle including the use of the water tank to store kerosene.
	


Use of Kerosene to clean the Pipelines of the Autopatch Vehicle


	
	Prior to the incident, Mr Jenkins had operated the Autopatch Vehicle for over 8 years. Kerosene was regularly used by Mr Jenkins to flush out the pipelines of the Paveline Autopatch Vehicle. The pipelines had been cleaned with kerosene in the weeks just prior to the incident. This was contrary to the design of the Autopatch Vehicle. The lines were designed to be cleaned with a water based cleaner and were not designed to be cleaned with kerosene.
	
	
	Kerosene was also stored in the water tank which was near the main steel feeder line. The tank was marked ‘water’. There was a warning label that stated only water was to be used in the tank.
	
	
	Mr Jenkins failed to undertake a risk assessment of the use of kerosene as a cleaning agent in the operation of the Autopatch Vehicle.
	
	
	Mr Jenkins also did not undertake a risk assessment of the risks associated with the use of the LPG open flame gas torch to heat a part of the Autopatch Vehicle near the pipelines that had been cleaned with kerosene.
	
	
	The risk was the risk to persons other than the CRS workers, including Mr Pollard, of suffering serious injuries or death, as a result of an explosion from the use of an LPG open flame gas torch to heat a part of the Autopatch Vehicle in the vicinity of flammable substances including the tank and pipelines containing kerosene, and/or the pressurised air pipelines and/or bitumen emulsion pipelines which had been cleaned with kerosene in the Autopatch Vehicle.
	


SYSTEMS OF WORK BEFORE THE INCIDENT


	
	Prior to the incident CRS had in place the ""CRS Project/Workplace Risk Assessment For Laying Bitumen"", dated 22 June 2015 (Risk Assessment). The Risk Assessment outlined flammable and explosive situations. This applied to the kerosene which was stored in the water tank.
	
	
	The Risk Assessment in parts 5 and 6 specified control measures, which included “Safely venting vapours from bitumen and associated substances, particularly when these products are heated to prevent the development of explosive atmospheres;  ensuring adequate ullage space within the storage and heating vessels; restricting all unnecessary ignition sources to a minimum of 3 metres from loading and heating;  eliminating ignition sources if low flash point cutters are used under conditions exceeding their flash points”.
	
	
	The Risk Assessment at page 9 included the following: ""Never use flame heating to clear blockages where fire and explosive hazards exist at the location”.
	
	
	The Operators Manual titled “Safety Procedures & Operating & Maintenance Instructions for Paveline Autopatch” was provided when the Paveline Autopatch Vehicle was sold to CRS.
	
	
	Given the warnings in the Risk Assessment and also the Operators Manual, Mr Jenkins should not have been using a gas torch to heat a part of the Autopatch Vehicle in the vicinity of the main steel feeder line, the pressurised pipelines which contained kerosene and the bitumen emulsion, and the pressurised air pipelines that had been cleaned with kerosene, when there was a risk of an explosion.
	
	
	There was no emergency plan in place. In the toolbox talks the employees of CRS were told to call '000' for any emergency.
	
	
	There was no induction training provided to the employees of CRS. The only training provided was on-the-job training. No training was provided to the employees in regards to the task of heating the pipelines near the main steel feeder line. CRS did not have in place at the time of the incident a Safety Management Plan.
	
	
	The work systems in place at the time were inadequate in that they did not sufficiently address the significant hazards associated with the storage and use of kerosene in the Autopatch Vehicle.
	


SYSTEMS OF WORK FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT


	
	After the incident CRS eliminated the use of kerosene in the Autopatch unit. Water was the only product to be held in the tank previously used for storing the kerosene. No fuels were to be kept on the Autopatch Vehicle.
	
	
	A fire protection sleeve was fitted over the pipelines that ruptured during the incident.
	
	
	CRS subsequently developed a health and safety management system.
	
	
	CRS also engaged an employee with a ‘Work Health and Safety’ background.
	
	
	The control measures implemented after the incident were available to CRS prior to the incident and it was reasonably practicable to have undertaken them.
	


THE OFFENDER’S EVIDENCE


	
	Mr Jenkins gave evidence by affidavit on behalf of both himself and CRS. He was not cross-examined.
	
	
	It is Mr Jenkins’ belief that not only had CRS never had any safety incident or accidents, other than the incident in question, but that all of the businesses conducted by him since 1996 were of a similar repute.
	
	
	CRS was founded in 2008. In 2009 Mr Jenkins purchased the Autopatch Vehicle and the vendor provided him with a basic lesson on how to use the vehicle. This was the only training Mr Jenkins received in any form.
	
	
	Mr Jenkins provided employees with on-the-job training, where they were limited to observation and basic work in their first few days. He asserts he was unable to find any “practical industry-based training” for the type of work CRS was undertaking. Each work day, he held a tool box talk where any potential hazards were outlined, and emergency evacuation points were also identified. CRS utilised Safe Work Method Statements (SWMS) based upon one provided by Leightons. The SWMS were also raised during the tool box talks.
	
	
	Employees were provided with necessary personal protection equipment by CRS, and their use of that equipment was also required.
	
	
	It was put by Mr Jenkins that at no stage did any employee of CRS, besides himself, use the LPG flame to liquefy bitumen.
	
	
	In 2010-2011 CRS began undertaking asphalt paving work. Over time this has come to constitute the majority of the offender’s business, with Mr Jenkins estimating it at around 95%. At the time of the incident it was approximately 50% of the business.
	
	
	CRS now employs 14 people and these employees are all heavily involved in the use of asphalt paving equipment.
	
	
	Since the incident, CRS has undertaken a number of measures in order to improve safety procedures and performance. These include:
	



	
	Removal of all flammable cleaning products from the process;
	
	
	Replacing old hoses and providing heat-proof covering;
	
	
	Ensuring a “Water Only” sign is affixed to relevant parts of the vehicle;
	
	
	Employing a work health and safety officer. This officer undertook a review of systems and policies in place, and updated the CRS SWMS to reflect current legislation, codes of practice and industry standards. These new SWMS now separate out different works that might be undertaken and all employees are required to sign off as being aware of and understanding each SWMS;
	
	
	The development and implementation by CRS of a plant/machinery risk assessment;
	
	
	The development and implementation by CRS of a comprehensive work health and safety policy;
	
	
	Contacting Australian Workplace Management (AWM) to assist in the development and finalisation of a suite of policies to ensure compliance with legislative requirements;
	
	
	Gaining accreditation from Sustainable Certification across a number of areas;
	
	
	All employees have undergone competency testing in relation to the plant and equipment which they may be required to operate. In addition, all employees are now trained in safe working methods;
	
	
	Four of CRS’ fourteen employees have undergone first aid training. A minimum of two first aid officers are always on site;
	
	
	CRS has employed a qualified mechanic to ensure plant and equipment is kept operating safely and to an industry standard. This includes the rectification of faults.
	



	
	Both CRS and Mr Jenkins acknowledge their guilt and have expressed contrition and remorse. They are deeply sorry for their actions. Mr Jenkins and his wife visited Mr Pollard in the hospital and offered both Mr Pollard and his wife assistance during that time.
	
	
	Mr Jenkins said that any fine imposed by the court will be paid from monies held in the Trust.
	
	
	Mr Jenkins agreed that CRS was profitable, and that both he and CRS had some capacity to pay fines. He did however ask that the court take into account that CRS employs 14 people and as such has a financial responsibility to their employees and their families. He was unsure of what impact a fine might have on the business, as this would be dependent upon the size of the fine. Senior Counsel for the defendants made it plain that no submission was made about any reduced capacity to pay.
	
	
	Both Mr Jenkins and CRS are active in the Wagga Wagga community. They have participated in and sponsored a number of different community activities in the local area.
	


CONSIDERATION


	
	I have had regard to the objects of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 set out in s 3 and the purposes of sentencing set out in s 3A.
	


OBJECTIVE SERIOUSNESS OF THE OFFENCE


	
	The proportionality principle requires that a sentence should neither exceed nor be less than the gravity of the crime having regard to the objective circumstances: Veen v R (No. 2) (1998) 164 CLR 465 at 472, 485-6, 490-1 and 496. At common law, the term “objective circumstances” was used to describe the circumstances of the crime. The gravity of the offence was assessed by reference to its objective seriousness: R v McNaughton (2006) 66 NSWLR 566 at [15].
	
	
	The task requires the court to consider where in the range of conduct covered by the offence the conduct of the offender falls: Baumer v R (1998) 166 CLR 51 at 57. This assessment will generally indicate the appropriate range of sentences available which will reflect the objective seriousness of the offence committed, and set the limits within which a sentence proportional to the criminality of the offender will lie: BW v R [2011] NSWCCA 176 at [70].
	
	
	The sentencing judge should take into account not only the conduct which actually constitutes the crime, but also such of the surrounding circumstances as are directly related to that crime and are properly regarded as circumstances of aggravation or mitigation: R v Wilkinson (No. 5) [2009] NSWSC 432 at [61].
	
	
	The existence of a reasonably foreseeable risk to safety that is likely to result in serious injury or death is a factor relative to the gravity of the offence: Capral Aluminium Limited v WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (2000) 49 NSWLR 610 at [89]. The question of foreseeability of the risk is to be determined objectively.
	
	
	The Court of Criminal Appeal has recently examined the sentencing process with regard to the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 in the matter of Nash v Silver City Drilling (NSW) Pty Limited; Attorney General for NSW v Silver City Drilling (NSW) Pty Limited [2017] NSWCCA 96; 93 NSWLR 338. His Honour Justice Basten at paragraph 34, under the heading ‘Assessment of Risk’ said:
	


The sentencing judge commenced his consideration with the proposition that ‘greater culpability attaches to the failure to guard against an event the occurrence of which is probable rather than an event the occurrence of which is extremely unlikely’. However the truth of that proposition depends upon other considerations including:

(a)   the potential consequences of the risk, which may be mild or catastrophic;

(b)   the availability of steps to lessen, minimise or remove the risk; and

(c)   whether such steps are complex and burdensome or only mildly inconvenient. Relative culpability depends on assessment of all those factors.


	
	Further at paragraph 42 his Honour continued:
	


The culpability of the Respondent is not necessarily to be determined by the remoteness of the risk occurring, nor by a step‑by‑step assessment of the various elements. Culpability will turn upon an overall evaluation of various factors, which may pull in different directions. Culpability in this case is reasonably high because, even if the pressure event of the force which occurred might not be expected to occur often, the seriousness of the foreseeable resultant harm is extreme and the steps to be taken to avoid it, were not even assessed, were straightforward and involved only minor inconvenience and little, if any, costs.


	
	My findings about the offenders’ level of culpability are based upon the following:
	



	
	It was reasonably practicable for the defendants to ensure the health and safety of Mr Pollard by ensuring that all workers were adequately trained, and the Plant was safe to operate in its then configuration.
	
	
	There was no induction training provided to the employees of CRS. The only training provided was on-the-job training. No training was provided to the employees in regards to the task of heating the pipelines near the main steel feeder line.
	
	
	The operating manual for the Autopatch Vehicle had not been read and/or explained to operators;
	
	
	CRS did not have in place at the time of the incident a Safety Management Plan. Nor was there an emergency plan in place. In the toolbox talks the employees of CRS were told to call '000' for any emergency.
	
	
	The cost to the offender of overcoming the risk was nil as there initially was a safe system/procedure available when the Autopatch Vehicle was purchased.
	
	
	The Autopatch Vehicle’s air purging system was not used for cleaning of emulsion lines.
	
	
	The Autopatch Vehicle’s internal heating system was not used to warm bitumen emulsion.
	
	
	Mr Jenkins had directed CRS to make modifications to the Autopatch Vehicle. The modifications were made to the water tank so that kerosene could be used to flush out the emulsion pipelines of the Autopatch Vehicle. This was contrary to the design of the Autopatch Vehicle. The Autopatch Vehicle should have been used in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations.
	
	
	The work systems in place at the time were inadequate in that they did not sufficiently address the significant hazards associated with the storage and use of kerosene in the Autopatch Vehicle.
	
	
	Mr Jenkins used an LPG open flame gas torch to heat components of the Autopatch Vehicle without having done any sort of risk assessment as to whether this was a safe work practice.
	
	
	It would have been a simple task for CRS and Mr Jenkins to either undertake or arrange a risk assessment of the modifications to the Autopatch Vehicle, the use of kerosene as a cleaning agent and the work practices utilised by Mr Jenkins.
	
	
	Mr Pollard and other workers were placed at risk of death or serious injury, being the risk of being seriously or fatally injured by the Autopatch Vehicle.
	
	
	The existence of the risk was known or should have been known as the risk was identified in:
	



	
	The ""CRS Project/Workplace Risk Assessment For Laying Bitumen"", dated 22 June 2015;
	
	
	The Operators Manual titled “Safety Procedures & Operating & Maintenance Instructions for Paveline Autopatch”.
	



	
	The risk of this accident happening was an obvious risk.
	
	
	The likelihood of the risk coming home was quite high.
	
	
	Simple remedial steps were available which would have completely avoided the risk.
	
	
	The injuries sustained by Mr Pollard on 1 July 2015 were a manifestation of the risk.
	
	
	This is not a case where there was a solitary casual and careless act. Mr Jenkins modified the equipment so that the water tank carried kerosene, he cleaned the hoses out with kerosene not water, and he then used an open flame to heat the equipment, when it already had a built-in safe water heating system. CRS and Mr Jenkins created the risk in the first place.
	



	
	I find that the offenders’ level of culpability is in the mid-range.
	


DETERRENCE


	
	The penalty imposed in relation to this offence must provide for general deterrence. Employers must take the obligations imposed by the Act very seriously. The community is entitled to expect that both small and large employers will comply with safety requirements. General deterrence is a significant factor when safety obligations are breached: Bulga Underground Operations Pty Limited v Nash (2016) NSWCCA 37 at [180].
	
	
	The penalty must reflect the need for specific deterrence. The offender is still conducting a business. Many of its operations involve the use of potentially dangerous equipment. It has 14 employees.
	


AGGRAVATING FACTORS


	
	The injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial: s 21A(2)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	


MITIGATING FACTORS


	
	Neither offender has previous convictions, so they do not have a significant record of previous convictions: s 21A(3)(e) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
	
	
	Both the offenders were otherwise of good character: s 21A(3)(f) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The steps which the offenders took after the incident demonstrate this. CRS has been in business since 2008.
	
	
	The offenders are unlikely to re-offend: s 21A(3(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	The offenders have good prospects of rehabilitation: s 21A(3)(h) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The offenders have taken positive steps to guard against the risk of an incident such as this ever happening again. CRS has brought its documentation and its procedures into line with those which, on all the evidence, should have been in place before this accident occurred.
	
	
	The offenders have shown remorse for the offence: s 21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The offenders have provided evidence through Mr Jenkins that they have accepted responsibility for their actions and have acknowledged that the injury to Mr Pollard was caused by their actions.
	
	
	The offenders entered a plea of guilty: s 21A(3)(k) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The court must take into account the fact that the offender has pleaded guilty, when the offender pleaded guilty, and the circumstances in which the offender indicated an intention to plead guilty: s 22(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. It is not appropriate to give the defendants a 25% discount for an early plea. Originally they pleaded not guilty to the offences. However, the plea was changed to guilty on 28 September 2017. The change of plea meant that the matter, from that point on, did not have to be prepared as a full trial. The plea of guilty also obviated the need for Mr Pollard to give any evidence. It is appropriate to apply a discount of 20%.
	
	
	The offenders gave assistance to law enforcement authorities: s 21A(3)(m) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The offenders co-operated at all times with the prosecutor and provided all documents requested in a prompt fashion.
	


CAPACITY TO PAY A FINE


	
	I am required to have regard to s 6 of the Fines Act 1996 before imposing a fine. Where an offender seeks to have a fine reduced on the basis of a limited capacity to pay, it bears the evidentiary onus of convincing the court that it should exercise its discretion to limit the amount of the fine. The offender’s capacity to pay is relevant but not decisive: Jahandideh v R [2014] NSWCCA 178 at [16]. A substantial fine may still be warranted as a result of the seriousness of the offence and the need for general deterrence.
	
	
	There was ultimately no submission made that any fines should be reduced.
	


COSTS


	
	The parties have agreed to an order that the offenders are to pay the prosecutor’s costs as agreed or assessed.
	


PENALTY FOR CRS


	
	The offender is convicted.
	
	
	The appropriate fine is $200,000 but that will be reduced by 20% to reflect the plea of guilty.
	
	
	I impose a fine of $160,000.
	
	
	I order pursuant to Section 122(2) of the Fines Act 1996 that 50% of the fine is to be paid to the prosecutor.
	
	
	I order the offender to pay the prosecutor’s costs as agreed or assessed.
	


PENALTY FOR MR JENKINS


	
	The offender is convicted.
	
	
	The appropriate fine is $50,000 but that will be reduced by 20% to reflect the plea of guilty.
	
	
	I impose a fine of $40,000.
	
	
	I order pursuant to s 122(2) of the Fines Act 1996 that 50% of the fine is to be paid to the prosecutor.
	
	
	I order the offender to pay the prosecutor’s costs as agreed or assessed.

		10 November 2017",2017-11-02 00:00:00,NSW District Court
6428931,R v RP [2017] NSWDC 310,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Often enough in these courts judges deal with a particular form of offence and offender. The offender is a man of advanced years, who has lived a lifetime of conservative and law abiding behaviour, yet he commits a serious sexual assault against a child, usually someone known to him. In most cases it is difficult to understand why that happens. But in the present case there is an explanation. The offender, RP, suffered a stroke. It has led to him suffering some frontal lobe dysfunction and him now facing sentence for a number of offences which carry maximum penalties of life imprisonment. It is far from Mr P’s fault that he had a stroke. He would not have committed these offences if that had not happened. His moral culpability is significantly diminished, but it remains the case that he has committed offences of terrible seriousness, which have caused enormous harm.
	
	
	Mr P has a granddaughter. When she was only three years of age, the offender began a relatively confined period of offending against her. The first offence was an indecent assault on a person under the age of 16. The offender was with his daughter, his son-in-law and his granddaughter at a shopping centre. His granddaughter was in the shopping trolley, sitting in the seats available for children, with her feet dangling down from the foot holes. The offender was pushing the trolley and as he did so, he used his fingers to rub her genital area on the outside of her clothing. That offence appears on a Form 1, attached to the next offence I will describe.
	
	
	That offence occurred on a different occasion. This time the victim was at her grandfather’s house with her parents. She was in an upstairs spare bedroom and wanted the offender to play with her. He went upstairs. He rubbed her genitals with his finger and then penetrated her vagina with his finger. It is poignant to note how young she was. Indeed, she was wearing a nappy at the time. Soon after this offence he performed an act of cunnilingus upon her and then stood up, exposing his penis to her for a short time. Those three offences consist of two offences of sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10, one being an offence involving digital penetration, the other an offence involving cunnilingus and an offence of committing an act of indecency with a person under the age of 10, which also appears on the Form 1.
	
	
	We next come to an offence committed on 3 April 2016, when the offender was at a friend’s house. As before, the victim was there with her parents. There were other adults there as well. At one stage the offender was in the lounge room playing Lego with the victim. The victim was wearing a skirt and a nappy. As she lay on her back, the offender placed the fingers of his right hand inside the leg of her nappy, rubbed her genitals with his finger and penetrated her vagina with his finger. That is another offence of sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10. She then rolled over onto her stomach and the offender inserted his fingers again under the nappy, rubbed her buttocks and penetrated her anus with his finger.
	
	
	Matters came to light when the victim complained to her mother that she experienced pain on urination. Her mother, the offender’s daughter, examined her daughter and saw that her vagina and anus were red. The victim told her mother, “Poppy puts his finger in my giney and bum”. She further told her mother that they play a secret game, where he puts his finger in her giney and told her further that “Poppy said I’m not supposed to tell you”.
	
	
	The following day the victim’s father went to the offender’s home and confronted him about his daughter’s disclosures. The offender admitted abusing his granddaughter. A few days later the matter was reported to police. The victim was interviewed as part of the JIRT process and a short time later, the offender was arrested. He made full admissions to the offences, stating that he knew that what he did was wrong and that, “It’s my fault, so I’ll serve the time”.
	
	
	As I mentioned, the most serious of these offences carry life imprisonment as a maximum penalty. They also carry a standard non-parole period of 15 years. I have taken into account both the standard non-parole period and the maximum penalty in determining the appropriate sentence to impose upon the offender. My reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period appear in these remarks on sentence.
	
	
	Consistent with the offender’s immediate admissions to his son-in-law and the police, he pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. The sentences I impose upon him will thus be about 25% less than they would otherwise have been.
	
	
	The offender had an unremarkable upbringing. He was born in Italy and came to Australia as a very young boy. He had relatively few sexual encounters before he married his wife. He has been married to her for 50 years. Their sex life was unremarkable too, gradually decreasing as the offender aged. But something happened. He had a stroke. Thereafter, his family noticed that he would act differently. He had sex with his wife more often and although he was previously a conservative man, he began acting quite differently, propositioning his wife for sex in public and in front of their children and even at one stage, putting his hand up his daughter-in-law’s dress.
	
	
	Investigations carried out for the purposes of today’s sentencing proceedings have revealed that the offender suffers from frontal lobe dysfunction. It is beyond doubt that the offender’s changed sexual behaviour, in particular his commission of these most serious offences, resulted directly from the stroke that he suffered.
	
	
	The offender has expressed his remorse. That is consistent with his early admissions and the fact that he disclosed further offences to police, beyond those which his granddaughter had told them about. He told a psychologist that he could not work out why he had done it.
	
	
	In the circumstances I have described, the offender’s moral culpability is significantly diminished. The sentence I will ultimately impose upon him is much lower than it would otherwise have been in order to reflect that circumstance.
	
	
	On the other hand, no-one has suggested that he was incapable of controlling his desires to molest his granddaughter. No-one has suggested he was acting as some sort of automaton, powerless to resist his illegal desires. He must still be punished for giving in to those desires, even if he had less ability than most to resist the temptation he was subject to.
	
	
	The parties made submissions to me about the effect of the stroke upon the offender and in particular, whether the stroke caused the offender to engage in paedophilic behaviour that he desired but was able to resist before the stroke, or whether the stroke caused the offender to want to engage in paedophilic behaviour. The evidence would suggest that the latter is the case. I am told by Ms Suters, who appears for the offender, without objection from the Crown, that nothing was found on examination by police, on the offender’s computer or anywhere else, which would indicate any interest of a sexual nature in children. The offender’s stroke has both created a perverted interest in children and rendered him less able to control such desires. It almost goes beyond saying, but I will say it, that the offender is not a suitable vehicle for a sentence containing a large component of general deterrence.
	
	
	The offending is most serious indeed. The three specific offences for which I must sentence the offender, all have a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. Three of them involve penetration of the victim’s vagina and anus. There is some small mercy that there was no penile penetration. The harm which he has caused was both foreseeable and regrettably commonplace. There was a gross breach of trust with the offences having a brazen quality about them, the child’s parents being in the location where the offences occurred, and he attempted to get his granddaughter’s silence, knowing of course, that what he was doing was seriously wrong. The victim was vulnerable indeed. She was only three years of age and thus able to be influenced by the depraved attentions of a family member.
	
	
	I mentioned the harm that has been caused. Because the victim herself, being now only four years of age, cannot tell us about it, her parents have prepared a victim impact statement on her behalf. The consequences for her of the offender’s crimes are serious. But as I said, they were entirely foreseeable. The offender is responsible for that harm, something he clearly acknowledges.
	
	
	I have taken into account that this was a relatively confined period of offending. But that was not because the offender intentionally stopped what he was doing. It was because the complainant disclosed matters to her mother, despite the offender’s attempts to get her not to.
	
	
	As far as the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation are concerned, I have to say they are uncertain, given the organic nature of what led to these offences in the first place. He has no support from almost all his family. A sister-in-law and a brother-in-law will do what they can to assist him upon his release from custody.
	
	
	The offender’s time in custody will be harder than would ordinarily be the case. His mental functioning is poor. He has problems with his memory and he is, vulnerable in prison to the predations of other prisoners. There is a risk that he will spend the entirety of his sentence in protection and there is a risk that if that happens, his conditions of custody will be harsher than those applying in the general prison population.
	
	
	There are special circumstances in this case. He is now 68. It will be some years before he is released from custody. He will need close supervision and assistance upon his release because of his age and mental condition, and that supervision may need to occur for an extended period of time. Accordingly, I will make a finding of special circumstances in his favour.
	
	
	In case I have not mentioned it, I have allowed a discount of 25% for the offender’s early pleas of guilty.
	
	
	I will impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment. Were I not to have done so, would have imposed sentences as follows. Sequence 2, taking into account the matters on the Form 1, digital penetration of the vagina, six years with a non-parole period of four. For sequence 3, the offence of cunnilingus, five and a half years, with a non-parole period of three and a half years. Sequence 5, digital penetration of the vagina, six years with a non-parole period of four years. Sequence 6, digital penetration of the anus, six years with a non-parole period of four years. I note that of course, the ratio for those indicative sentences does not match the ratio of the aggregate sentence, but as the indicative sentence ratios are not determinative of the aggregate sentence ratio, I will apply my finding of special circumstances to the aggregate sentence.
	
	
	I set a non-parole period of eight years to date from 8 April 2016 with a head sentence of 12 years. The offender will be eligible to be released to parole on 7 April 2024.
	
	
	I will recommend that all reports in exhibits A, B and C are provided to the Corrective Services authorities, so that appropriate placement for Mr P can be arranged.

Indonesia’s extradition request arose out of allegations of embezzlement and money laundering.  Mr Liem is alleged to have obtained some 134 cheques, totalling the equivalent of approximately AUD $13 million, from an Indonesian company of which he was the “President Director”.  He is alleged to have used the proceeds of those cheques for himself or to his benefit.2    This is:(1)    an appeal by Mr Liem under s 21 of the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth) from orders made under s 19(9) of that Act by the third respondent, a New South Wales magistrate, that he was eligible for surrender to the first respondent, Indonesia (statutory appeal); and(2)    an application by Mr Liem for judicial review under s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) of:(a)    the decision of the second respondent, the Minister for Justice of the Commonwealth, to issue a notice under s 16 of the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth), having necessarily formed an opinion that Mr Liem was an “extraditable person” within the meaning of s 6 of the Extradition Act; and(b)    collaterally, the magistrate’s decision that Mr Liem was eligible for surrender, as having been reached without the foundational jurisdiction of a valid s 16 notice issued by the Minister (judicial review application).  3    Indonesia appears only in relation to the statutory appeal, to which the Minister is also an active party.  The Minister is the sole active opposing party to the judicial review application.  The magistrate filed a conventional submitting appearance as the third respondent in relation to both the statutory appeal and the judicial review application, save as to costs.  Where it is necessary to identify submissions made on behalf of both Indonesia and the Minister in relation to the statutory appeal, it will be convenient to refer to those parties collectively as “the respondents”.  The submissions resisting judicial review relief are by the Minister alone.4    A single amended originating application filed on behalf of Mr Liem advances four grounds of statutory appeal and then four grounds of judicial review.  Only three of those statutory appeal grounds were ultimately pressed.  For the reasons that follow, all seven surviving grounds of appeal or review must fail.  The amended originating application must therefore be dismissed with costs and the orders of the magistrate confirmed. Relevant Extradition Act requirements 5    The extradition process was conveniently summarised in Harris v Attorney-General (Cth) (1994) 52 FCR 386 at 389 as follows:The stages of the legislative schemeThe Act contemplates four stages in extradition proceedings as follows: (1) Commencement; (2) Remand; (3) Determination by a magistrate of eligibility for surrender; (4) Executive determination that the person is to be surrendered.  In summary form, the scheme is as follows: The commencement of proceedings is by the issue of a provisional warrant under s 12(1) or by the giving of a notice under s 16(1).  Once arrested, the person is required by s 15 to be taken before a magistrate and remanded in custody or on bail for such period as may be necessary for eligibility proceedings to be taken under s 19.  Where a person is on remand under s 15 and the Attorney General has given a notice under s 16(1), provision is made under s 19 for a magistrate to conduct proceedings to determine whether the person is eligible for surrender.  If eligibility is so determined by the magistrate, provision is made by s 22 for the Attorney-General to decide whether the person is to be surrendered.6    The above summary in Harris is sufficient for present purposes, despite amendments to the Extradition Act since that time, especially since 2012: see also Vasiljkovic v The Commonwealth [2006] HCA 40; 227 CLR 614 at [16]-[29], [52]-[60] and [143]-[155] for a more detailed summary of the overall extradition scheme.  Most of the essential features of the scheme remain the same as those described in Harris and Vasiljkovic.  However, references in cases to the meaning and effect of particular sections of the Extradition Act must be approached with caution in case they have relevantly changed.  7    An important example of a legislative change that has affected the way in which certain of the authorities must be read and understood concerns the point in the extradition process at which any “extradition objections” under s 7 of the Extradition Act are taken into account.  Extradition objections can arise for determination in cases concerning political offences or persecution.  The determination of such objections was not in issue in this case except for the purpose of understanding certain of the earlier cases relied upon by counsel for Mr Liem.  8    Extradition objections used to form a part of the process by which the Attorney-General (now including the Minister) decided under s 16(1) of the Extradition Act whether to state that an extradition request had been received.  This was a necessary step for an extradition request to proceed to an extradition hearing.  Extradition objections were also part of the next-stage determination by the magistrate (or eligible Federal Circuit Court judge) under s 19 of the Extradition Act as to whether the person was eligible for surrender.  9    Extradition objections are now considered only at the stage of consideration by a magistrate or eligible Federal Circuit Court judge.  They continue to form a part of the determination as to whether a person is eligible for surrender.  Extradition objections therefore remain a part of the adversarial process before the magistrate or judge.  They form part of the administrative, rather than judicial process, conducted personum designata by the magistrate or judge: see Hilton v Wells (1985) 157 CLR 57 at 68, 72-3; Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Maria Kainhofer [1995] HCA 35; 185 CLR 528 at 538, 540 and 543.  While extradition objections formed no part of Mr Liem’s case in resisting extradition, the change removing extradition objections from the s 16 notice process affects in an important way the scope of the decision to state that a request has been received.  In this case, that includes the characterisation of the role of the Minister when he issued the notice under s 16(1) of the Extradition Act in relation to Mr Liem.10    If a decision is made not to give notice that the request has been “received”, then notice must be given directing the magistrate or judge to cancel the arrest warrant: see s 12(3) of the Extradition Act.  If no request is made for extradition within 45 days of arrest, or no s 16 notice issues within a further five days, the person must be brought before a magistrate or eligible Federal Circuit Court judge and must be ordered to be released: see s 17 of the Extradition Act.11    A statement by notice to a relevant judicial officer of receipt of an extradition request under s 16(1) of the Extradition Act is therefore a necessary step for extradition proceedings to take place.  That notice can only issue if the Attorney-General, or in this case the Minister fulfilling the same role, is of the opinion that the person sought to be extradited is an “extraditable person”: see s 16(2).  The meaning of “extraditable person” is defined in s 6 of the Extradition Act.  In particular, a person can only fall within that definition if, amongst other things, they are “accused of having committed” an “extradition offence” in relation to the country seeking extradition: see s 6(a)(i) and (b). Key issues arising in this appeal12    The key issues raised in these proceedings are:(1)    whether the request material from Indonesia was capable of establishing that Mr Liem was “accused of having committed” an “extradition offence”;(2)    if so, whether that request material was sufficient to establish that Mr Liem was “accused of having committed” an “extradition offence”; and (3)    if so, whether the Minister lawfully reached the conclusion that Mr Liem was an extraditable person, by reason of insufficient consideration of the material before him or failure to afford procedural fairness.13    Before turning to the grounds of statutory appeal and of judicial review, and the competing arguments, it is convenient to consider how prior cases, including binding authority, have determined a pivotal issue raised on behalf of Mr Liem.  The issue raised is what was required of the extradition request material from Indonesia to enable an opinion to be formed by the Minister that Mr Liem was an “extraditable person”, with particular reference to the requirement that he was “accused of having committed” an “extradition offence”.14    In Kainhofer, Gummow J relevantly said at 563-4:… the term ""extraditable person"", as defined in s 6, is expressed as applying ""for the purposes of this Act"", that is to say, not only for the purposes of extradition from Australia (Pt II, ss 12- 27), but also extradition to Australia from other countries (Pt IV, ss 40-44).  This suggests that the phrase in the definition ""the person is accused"" has, with due allowance for the differing legal systems that may be involved, a broadly similar operation. …I would not accept the proposition that there must be an authorised public accusation of equivalent effect to what in common law systems would be treated as an indictment or the laying of an information.  Care must be taken to allow, within the limits mentioned earlier in these reasons, what in the United States was called a ""reasonable cosmopolitan interpretation"".  In particular, differences between denomination or categorisation of procedures should not be given too great a weight.  The fundamental question is whether the person whose extradition is sought under Pt II is one in respect of whom there has been taken by the competent authorities in the extradition country a decision to invoke the operation of the criminal law by the taking of whatever steps are necessary to initiate what might fairly be described as a prosecution.15    The above approach by Gummow J in Kainhofer was followed by the Full Court in O’Connor v Zentai [2011] FCAFC 102; 195 FCR 515 per Besanko J at [53] and per Jessup J (with North J agreeing on this issue) at [140].  The passage at [140] made it clear that:… the question [is] not whether the respondent would, on the same or analogous facts, have been regarded as an “accused” person in accordance with Australian criminal law and procedure.  Rather, it was whether the legal and factual circumstances in [the requesting country] were such as would invoke the concept of the respondent being “accused” as that word is used in s 6 of the Act.16    In Zentai, it was further observed by Jessup J at [142] that:In my view, it follows from the judgments of Gummow J in Kainhofer and of Lord Steyn in Ismail that there will not, or at least will not always, be a bright line in the perception of an Australian court between the circumstances of a person who is, and those of a person who is not, “accused” in the context of criminal proceedings in a civil law jurisdiction.  In the present case, the evidence was that Hungarian prosecuting authorities had a well-founded suspicion that the respondent had committed an offence.  Hungary had advised that, under continental law, criminal proceedings were started upon the existence of such a suspicion.  Those criminal proceedings, in the present case, were said to exist “before the Military Prosecutor’s Office” rather than “before the Military Panel of the Metropolitan Court”.  Nonetheless, an international warrant for the arrest of the respondent had been issued.  This was done by a judge, on the motion of a prosecutor during the investigative stage of the proceeding.  In my view, it would have involved no misdirection on the part of the Minister had he formed the view, as he was invited to do by Att C, that the respondent was wanted for prosecution within the meaning of Art 1 of the Treaty.  It would not have been a misdirection for the Minister to have concluded that, in Hungary, a person in respect of whom there is a well-founded suspicion of the commission of an offence, and in respect of whom a warrant has been issued on the motion of a prosecutor, is wanted for prosecution, notwithstanding that the immediate stage of the procedure remained that of investigation, and that no charge had yet been laid.17    The above passage from Zentai reinforces the need to be alert to the risk that the application of criminal investigation and prosecution processes in Australia as a guide to the meaning of “accused” in s 6(a)(i) of the Extradition Act may lead to error.  It may not always be easy to look at extradition request material free of such undue influence, as the reasoning of Gummow J in Kainhofer, reinforced by the Full Court in Zentai, requires.  An important aspect of these proceedings entails ensuring that what is considered in the judicial review application is the statutory test, not local practices and procedures, to determine whether, on the totality of the extradition material, an opinion could be, and was, lawfully formed by the Minister that Mr Liem was “accused of having committed” an “extradition offence”.Arrest, extradition request and proceedings before the magistrate18    Mr Liem was arrested in Australia on 19 December 2016, pursuant to a provisional arrest warrant issued by a magistrate of the Australian Capital Territory on 28 October 2016 under s 12(1) of the Extradition Act.  In issuing the warrant, the ACT magistrate affirmed that a statutory application had been made on behalf of Indonesia for the issue of an arrest warrant in relation to Mr Liem, and stated that he was satisfied that Mr Liem was an “extraditable person” for the purposes of the Extradition Act in relation to Indonesia.  There is no challenge to the issue of the arrest warrant, nor to the arrest of Mr Liem.19    On 23 January 2017, an request was received by Australia from Indonesia seeking that: Ronny Liem who is wanted to face prosecution in Indonesia for the embezzlement against Article 374 of the Indonesian Criminal Code and money laundering against Article 3 and Article 4 of the Law Number 8 Year 2010 on Money Laundering Crime Prevention and Eradication be returned to Indonesia to be dealt with according to law.20    It is necessary to reproduce additional parts of the request in some detail in order to address the appeal and judicial review points raised, especially on the issue of whether they provide sufficient material for the Minister to form the opinion that Mr Liem was “accused of having committed” an “extradition offence” and was thus an “extraditable person” for the purposes of the Extradition Act in relation to Indonesia.  The request relevantly further stated the following (emphasis in original):Objective of extradition request2.    The objective of request for extradition submitted by the Government of the Republic of Indonesia to the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia is to arrest, detain, and extradite a criminal offender in Australia name [sic] Ronny Liem, which became fugitive for prosecution in Indonesia for embezzlement and money laundering offences.…8.    According to the Indonesian law, the Indonesian National Police as the investigation institution in the Republic of Indonesia having authority to arrest and detain according to Article 6 (1) item a and Article 7 (1) item d of the Indonesian Criminal Code of Procedure.Statement of authority to prosecute9.    The competent authority who will make prosecution to Ronny Liem is the Public Prosecutor of the District Attorney Office in Indonesia.10.    Based on Article 8 (2) and (3) item b, Article 138 (1), and Article 139 of the Indonesian Criminal Code of Procedure, if the suspect Ronny Liem is be handed over to the competent authority in Indonesia then the Public Prosecutor Office in Indonesia will issue the notification stating that the public prosecutor agrees and decides to prosecute the suspect of crime after the delivery the suspect and the case file by the Indonesian National Police to the public prosecutor.…Text of provisions in Article 138 (1) Indonesian Criminal Code of Procedure is:After receiving the investigation finding and the investigator immediately learning and examining the same and within seven days, the Public prosecutor shall notify to the investigator whether the investigation finding is already complete or not.Text of provisions in Article 139 Indonesian Criminal Code of Procedure is:After receiving or re-receiving the complete investigation finding from the investigator, the public prosecutor shall immediately determine whether the case file is already fulfilling the requirements to be able to be delegated to the court or not.11.    After the Public Prosecutor has the custody right over the evidence and suspect, the Public Prosecutor may only stop the prosecution in a very limited conditions, for example if being found any of the exceptions based on the prevailing legislation in Indonesia namely due to mental disorder, age under 16 (sixteen) years old, or due to demise, or poor health condition or in case of there is uncertantinty [sic] regarding the identity of the said person. The Public Prosecutor cannot make the decision over such exception, until the Public Prosecutor has the custody right over the evidence and suspected criminal perpetrator.Offences for which extradition is sought12.    The extradition of Ronny Liem to Indonesia is sought for prosecution of the following offences:Embezzlementa.    Article 374 of the Indonesian Criminal Code:“Embezzlement committed by any person who has possession of the property on account of his personal service or of his profession or for monetary compensation, shall be punished by a maximum imprisonment of 5 (five) years”.Money Launderingb.    Article 2 of the Law Number 8 Year 2010 on Money Laundering Crime Prevention and Eradication:(1)    “Result of the criminal action shall be the Assets acquired from the criminal actions as follow:…q.    embezzlement;r.    fraud;…Statement for alleged conduct done by Ronny Liem15.    Ronny Liem is the Director of PT. Indonesia Konsorsium Investama (PT. IKI), a stock trading company, from 2011 until 2015, pursuant to Notarial Deed Number 134 dated 29 May 2006, issued by Public Notary Edison Jingga, SH.16.    Sometime between 25 February 2011 and 10 April 2015, Ronny Liem as the President Director of PT. IKI, instructed Marlin (a Financial Staff of PT. IKI) and Vinewati (Accountant of PT. IKI) to gradually deliver to himself 134 papers of cheque.17.    Ronny Liem ordered Marlin and Vinawati to issue those cheques without going through the procedure that has been determined by PT. IKI, such as financial control and consultation.18.    In 2015, it was found that Ronny Liem has cashed those cheques and he never pay for it to PT. IKI. According to Financial Division, the PT. IKI has suffered a big loss amounted Rp. 131,995,995,000 (one hundred thirty one billion nine hundred ninty [sic] five million and nine hundred ninety five thousand rupiah).19.    Ronny Liem used the PT. IKI’s money for his personal purposes and according to further investigation it was known that those funds were used for establishing his new businesses.21    Attached to the extradition request was a copy of the arrest warrant issued by Indonesia on 27 December 2016 in respect of Mr Liem, following his arrest in Australia, stating the following:In the interest of criminal act investigation, it is necessary to arrest the person strongly alleged to have committed criminal act based on adequate preliminary evidences.…IT IS HEREBY ORDERED…To:    1. Arrest the suspect hereinbelow:Name:    RONNY aka RONNY LIEM…wherever the suspect is situated and further brought to the office of Criminal Investigation Department of National Police of the Republic of Indonesia for examination as suspect, since based on adequate preliminary evidence the act the suspect has fulfilled the component of criminal act of functional embezzlement and Money Laundering, as referred to in Article 374 KUHP (Criminal Code), Article 3 and Article 4 Law No.8 of 2010 regarding Prevention and Eradication of Criminal Act of Money Laundering occurring from February 25, 2011 to April 10, 2015 in the office of PT Indonesia Konsorsium Investama, Jakarta;…3.    This Warrant shall be effective from December 23, 2016 to completion thereof;4.    after fulfilling this warrant, the Arrest Report and Body/Clothing Search Report shall be drawn up.22    On 27 January 2017, the Minister issued a notice of receipt of an extradition request under s 16(1) of the Extradition Act, stating that:… an extradition request has been received from the Republic of Indonesia, an extradition country, in relation to Ronny Liem for the following extradition offences:•    Embezzlement contrary to Article 374 of the Indonesian Criminal Code•    Money Laundering contrary to Articles 3 and 4 of Law Number 8 Year 2010 on the Prevention and Eradication of Money Laundering 23    On 14 March 2017, Indonesia applied to a magistrate for proceedings to be conducted to determine whether Mr Liem was eligible for surrender to Indonesia.  On the same day, a magistrate made orders for the preparation of eligibility proceedings. 24    On 18 May 2017, proceedings were conducted by Magistrate Price in New South Wales to determine the eligibility of Mr Liem for surrender to Indonesia.  His Honour determined that Mr Liem was eligible for surrender under s 19 of the Extradition Act, and issued a warrant under s 19(9) ordering the committal of Mr Liem to prison to await surrender.25    On 1 June 2017, Mr Liem filed an originating application initiating these proceedings. That originating application was amended by consent and a copy of that amended originating application was handed up at the hearing of the appeal on 23 August 2017, with leave granted for that amended originating application to be filed.  The amended originating application was ultimately filed on 20 October 2017.26    In considering the issues on appeal, it is convenient to first address the judicial review grounds contained in the amended originating application, and the statutory appeal grounds second.The judicial review grounds as pleaded and an overview27    The following four grounds of judicial review are grounds 5 to 8 in the amended originating application (emphasis in original to indicate the additional proposed grounds in respect of which leave to amend was granted; formatting as per original):5.    The Second Respondent acted outside of jurisdiction in issuing the section 16 notice as it was not open to conclude that the applicant was an ‘extraditable person’ as defined in section 6 of the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth).6.    The Third Respondent acted without jurisdiction because the notice issued under section 16 of the Act by the Second Respondent was issued outside of jurisdiction and a nullity.7.    The Second Respondent acted outside of jurisdiction in issuing the section 16 notice by failing to give proper genuine and realistic consideration to the issue of whether the Applicant was accused of an offence in Indonesia and therefore was or was not an ‘extraditable person’ as defined in section 6 of the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth).8.    The Second Respondent acted outside of jurisdiction in issuing the section 16 notice as the Applicant was denied procedural fairness because the material before the Second Respondent did not fairly and accurately present the evidence and issues relevant to whether the Applicant was accused of an offence in Indonesia and therefore was or was not an ‘extraditable person’ as defined in section 6 of the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth).28    Each of the judicial review grounds are directed only to the Minister, and not to Indonesia.  They are only collaterally directed to the magistrate, upon the basis that his Honour did not have jurisdiction by reason of the s 16 notice being invalidly issued.  29    Grounds 5 and 6, the first and second judicial review grounds, may be seen as going to the capacity of the request material that was before the Minister to ground the required opinion that the applicant was “an extraditable person” as defined in s 6 of the Extradition Act, by reason of the required aspect of being a person who is “accused of having committed” the “extradition offence[s]”.  The issue is therefore one of the sufficiency of the request material before the Minister in this particular respect.  It was common ground that if the first judicial review ground succeeded, the second judicial review ground would also have to succeed.30    Grounds 7 and 8, the third and fourth judicial review grounds, are in the alternative to the first two grounds.  They are only reached if the first two grounds fail, upon the basis of a finding by the Court that the extradition material before the Minister did have the necessary capacity to ground the s 16(2) opinion.  In the event of that finding, these two grounds challenge, in different ways, the decision-making process that was undertaken to reach the requisite opinion.  31    The substance of the third judicial review ground is an assertion that the Minister failed to consider (as was said to be required) the possibility that the applicant was not a person who is “accused of having committed” the “extradition offence[s]”.  The substance of the fourth judicial review ground is a related assertion that the Minister denied the applicant procedural fairness by not allowing him to be heard on the question of whether he was a person who was “accused of having committed” the “extradition offence[s]”.    Grounds 5 and 6 – the first and second judicial review grounds: asserted incapacity of the material to establish a conclusion by the Minister that the applicant was “accused of having committed the offences”32    The submissions for Mr Liem in relation to the first judicial review ground, made orally and/or in writing, may be summarised as follows:(1)    The material before the Minister (primarily, the extradition request and the departmental submission) could not reasonably have led to the formation of an opinion by the Minister that Mr Liem was accused of having committed the extradition offences and was thus an “extraditable person” within the meaning of s 6 of the Extradition Act. (2)    The extradition request and the submission provided numerous “factual propositions” that Mr Liem was wanted for an investigatory purpose, rather than for a prosecution purpose.  These included:(a)    that the arrest warrant within the extradition request was issued by an Indonesian police officer rather than by a court;(b)    that no decision had been made by a “competent authority” in Indonesia to prosecute the applicant; and(c)    that the warrant expressed the purpose of detaining the applicant as for “examination as suspect”.  (3)    Counsel for Mr Liem relied on the consideration of this issue by Gummow J in Kainhofer at 564, being the last sentence of the quote reproduced at [14] above:The fundamental question is whether the person whose extradition is sought under Pt II is one in respect of whom there has been taken by the competent authorities in the extradition country a decision to invoke the operation of the criminal law by the taking of whatever steps are necessary to initiate what might fairly be described as a prosecution.Counsel’s written submissions asserted that the initiation of a prosecution was the relevant standard by which to consider the meaning of being “accused” of an offence in relation to s 6 of the Extradition Act.(4)    It was thus asserted that it was not open to the Minister to issue the s 16 notice, and the notice therefore ought to be quashed by reason of being a nullity.33    In relation to the second judicial review ground, counsel for Mr Liem submitted that if the first judicial review ground was made out as to the s 16 notice being issued outside of jurisdiction and thus being a nullity, then the necessary precondition for the s 19 proceedings did not exist and those proceedings were also rendered a nullity. 34    In response, the Minister submitted, orally and/or in writing, that:(1)    In considering whether the purpose underlying the extradition request was one of investigation or prosecution, it was erroneous to rely on the “factual propositions” highlighted by the applicant within the extradition request in isolation, and without regard to the extradition request materials as a whole. (2)    Undue emphasis was being placed on the words “investigative” and “suspect” within the extradition request, as understood from an Australian criminal law and procedure perspective, and that this was being done without holistic regard to the Indonesian process to which the applicant would be subject.  (3)    Regard should be had to the explanation provided in the arrest warrant (when read in conjunction with the extradition request) of the stage of the Indonesian criminal process the applicant was presently at; namely, that, having been “strongly alleged” of committing embezzlement and money laundering crimes, the applicant would now, upon being surrendered to the competent authority in Indonesia, be subject to a prosecution notice by the Public Prosecutor Office in Indonesia that would formally commence the prosecution process.  The necessity for the Indonesian Public Prosecutor to be given custody over the suspect by police for prosecutorial decision-making purposes was also relied upon.(4)    Given that the above facts formed part of the material before the Minister, there was “ample basis” for the Minister to conclude that Indonesia had taken steps to invoke the operation of its criminal laws with respect to Mr Liem so as to commence what might fairly be considered as a prosecution, and thus to conclude that the applicant was “accused of having committed” the “extradition offence[s]” within the meaning of s 6 of the Extradition Act.35    For completeness, counsel for the Minister also submitted that:(1)    It is accepted in Australian jurisprudence that a person may be “accused” of an offence for the purposes of the Extradition Act, yet still be subject to an investigative step in the criminal process: Zentai at [142]; Snedden v Minister for Justice [2014] FCAFC 156; 230 FCR 82 at 120-121.  (2)    Nothing turns on the arrest warrant having been signed by an Indonesian police officer, that having been a feature of a number of prior cases, including Kommatas v Hellenic Republic [2014] FCA 1224; 144 ALD 303 at [10]-[13]; Radhardja v Republic of Indonesia [2000] FCA 1297 (Full Court) at [11]; and Prabowo v Republic of Indonesia (1995) 61 FCR 258 at 261G.  36    It should be noted that in Kommatas at [12], the first instance decision of French J (as his Honour then was) in Cabal v United Mexican States (No 3) [2000] FCA 1204; 186 ALR 188 at [145]-[146] was quoted and relied upon; particularly, the passage in Cabal at [146] that reinforces the notion that the procedural and content requirements of the requesting country need not be questioned as to whether they comply with like obligations in Australia, a position that was upheld by the Full Court on appeal: Cabal v United Mexican States [2001] FCA 427; 108 FCR 311.  French J stated in that passage that neither the magistrate nor this Court upon review were obliged to inquire into the procedural requirements of the requesting country, albeit in the context of ascertaining whether a purported arrest warrant was in fact such a warrant.  What matters is the repetition of the notion, in effect, that this Court takes the foreign laws and procedures as they are described in the extradition material, subject only to meeting the statutory criteria in the Extradition Act if that is raised as an issue.37    On the basis of the above submissions, the Minister argued that the first and second judicial review grounds should fail.38    By way of submissions in reply on behalf of Mr Liem, it was submitted that:(1)    Contrary to the respondents’ submissions, there was no “test” for determining whether a person is “accused” for the purposes of s 6, and that although a “reasonable cosmopolitan interpretation” should be adopted as to whether competent authorities in an extradition country have taken the necessary steps to initiate a prosecution, as articulated by Gummow J in Kainhofer at 563, there was nonetheless no “bright line” guiding that interpretation.  That interpretation should therefore be approached on a case-by-case basis: Zentai at [142].  That submission does not in substance differ from the submission of the Minister in principle, although a different conclusion is urged on behalf of Mr Liem in the particular circumstances of his case.(2)    The respondents relied on no authority to suggest that the only reasonable or possible conclusion open to the Minister was that the applicant was a person “accused” of an offence within the meaning of s 6 of the Extradition Act.  It is appropriate to note at this juncture that it is not apparent to me why the opinion must be the only “possible” conclusion.  Moreover, the term “reasonable” must be confined to the concept of legal unreasonableness if this Court is to avoid straying into impermissible merits review: Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Li [2013] HCA 18; 249 CLR 332 at [63]-[76], as followed by the Full Court of this Court in Minister for Immigration and Border Protection v Stretton [2016] FCAFC 11; 237 FCR 1 at [8]-[13], [52]-[59] and [92].  See also Minister for Immigration and Border Protection v Eden [2016] FCAFC 28; 240 FCR 158 at 171 [58]-[60].(3)    The Minister was not obliged to accept “conclusory statements” within the extradition request material as to the applicant being wanted for prosecution.  Rather, the Minister was required to be appropriately sceptical and critical of the contents of the Indonesian request.  This argument was developed further in relation to the third judicial review ground.39    The resolution of this dispute requires a careful consideration of the content of the extradition request material from Indonesia and, in particular, the parts reproduced earlier in these reasons.  That examination supports the arguments advanced on behalf of the Minister and provides only superficial support for Mr Liem’s case.  While the domestic legal and procedural arrangements in Indonesia disclosed in the request material mean that the first steps in the prosecution process must start with police, the numerous references in the request to Mr Liem being wanted for prosecution cannot simply be disregarded as “conclusory”.  Rather, they should be viewed as a statement of how the prosecution process operates, and relevantly would operate upon Mr Liem being extradited to Indonesia.40    Reading the extradition request materials as a whole, there is no proper reason to doubt that Mr Liem will be prosecuted upon his return to Indonesia, and that the steps necessary for that to take place now await only his return, subject to whether anything further might be required by the public prosecutor in Indonesia.  That may entail, for example, meeting some shortcoming in the evidence, which is a common feature of any kind of litigation in Australia, and, as may readily be inferred from the extradition material, in Indonesia also.  If there is any such shortcoming in the evidence, it is likely to be formal, given the detail provided as to the evidence that has already been obtained, including from a substantial number of witnesses.  41    In particular, and, importantly, in the context of the evidence referred to in some detail in respect of the 134 cheques, including narrative summaries of witness evidence, the request expressly and clearly states that:(1)    Mr Liem “is wanted to face prosecution in Indonesia”;(2)    Mr Liem “became fugitive for prosecution in Indonesia”;(3)    the “competent authority who will make prosecution” of Mr Liem is “the Public Prosecutor of the District Attorney Office in Indonesia”;(4)    if Mr Liem is “handed over”, which should be understood to mean extradited to Indonesia, then the Public Prosecutor will “issue the notification stating that the public prosecutor agrees and decides to prosecute the suspect of crime after the delivery [of] the suspect and the case file by the Indonesian National Police to the public prosecutor”;(5)    Articles 138(1) and 139 of the Indonesian Criminal Code of Procedure require the Public Prosecutor to advise the investigators whether their investigation is ready to prosecute, which is, even in Australia, a part of the interchange between prosecutors and investigators, including as to whether any further evidence is required; (6)    the Public Prosecutor may only “stop” a prosecution on “limited conditions”, such as where the person facing prosecution has a mental disorder, is under the age of 16, has some other health problem or other “demise” or there is uncertainty as to their identity.  This reinforces the view that the preceding paragraph in the request is referring to final preparations for prosecution, rather than reflecting any reservation about a prosecution taking place; and (7)    that Mr Liem is “sought for prosecution” for the named offences of embezzlement and money laundering under particular offence provisions.  42    Applying the authorities cited above, and Kainhofer and Zentai in particular, to the features identified above, it was well and truly open to the Minister to conclude that Mr Liem was an “extraditable person” within the meaning of s 6(a)(i) of the Extradition Act.  The question of whether the submission itself was sufficient for that purpose is considered in relation to the third judicial review ground below.43    It follows that ground 5, the first judicial review ground, must fail, and consequently, ground 6, the second judicial review ground, must fail also. Ground 7 – third judicial review ground: asserted failure by the Minister to consider whether the applicant was not “accused of having committed the offences”44    The submissions for Mr Liem in relation to the third judicial review ground, made orally and in writing, may be summarised as follows:(1)    The failure of the departmental submission:(a)    to draw the Minister’s attention to a requirement that he be satisfied that Mr Liem was wanted for prosecution rather than investigation, or the complexities of that issue generally; and (b)    to assist the Minister to actually determine whether he was of the opinion that Mr Liem was accused of an offence, meant that the Minister failed to take a material fact into account and could thus not have formed his state of satisfaction reasonably or according to law, in the sense articulated in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40; 162 CLR 24 at [30]-[31] per Gibbs CJ.  Thus the Minister failed to give “proper, genuine and realistic consideration” to this issue, and therefore to whether the applicant was an “extraditable person” within the meaning of s 6 of the Extradition Act.  (2)    Counsel for Mr Liem relied on Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs (No 2) [2007] FCA 1684; 98 ALD 589 at [93], on this issue, and reiterated that this ground went to the sufficiency of the material before the Minister.  (3)    Citing Commonwealth v Dutton [2000] FCA 1466; 102 FCR 168 at [32]-[33], the Minister had failed to be a “contradictor to the claim of the requesting country” in forming the requisite satisfaction to issue a s 16 notice, and that, by extension of a related submission as to the first judicial review ground, the Minister had failed to afford the necessary scrutiny to Indonesia’s extradition claims, particularly in not giving real and genuine consideration to the question of whether the applicant was “accused” of an offence.  45    In response, the Minister submitted, orally and in writing, that the applicant’s submissions were erroneous, particularly for their reliance on Tervonen.  Unlike in Tervonen, the Minister had the complete extradition request before him and, accordingly, there was ample material within the extradition request materials to allow the Minister to give “proper, genuine and realistic consideration”, in the sense affirmed in Tervonen, to the question of whether the applicant was “accused of having committed” the “extradition offence[s]” relied upon by Indonesia.46    The passage in Dutton at [32]-[33] relied upon by counsel for Mr Liem for the proposition that the Minister was required to be a “contradictor” who in some way opposes extradition does not bear closer scrutiny, notwithstanding that the expression “contradictor” was also used by Young J writing for the Full Court in von Arnim v Ellison [2006] FCAFC 49; 150 FCR 282 at [70]-[71].  First, the comment in Dutton was more nuanced and subtle than represented by counsel for Mr Liem, once read in context as referring to ensuring that safeguards are properly observed.  However, more fundamentally, it was a comment made in the very different statutory context of an “extradition objection” being taken into account at the s 16 notice stage, by reason of the terms of the former s 16(2)(b) of the Extradition Act.  The presence or otherwise of an extradition objection no longer has any bearing on the process by which the Minister determines whether or not to give a s 16 notice that a request has been received.  The determination of extradition objections has now been left solely to the magistrate (or Federal Circuit Court judge) ascertaining eligibility for surrender: see s 19(2)(d) of the Extradition Act.  This is therefore a potent example of the danger in relying upon what has been said in prior cases without checking that the legislative context is relevantly and substantially the same.47    The passage in Tervonen at [93] contained a restatement of the oft-cited obligation on an administrative decision-maker to give “proper, genuine and realistic consideration” to the merits of a case, and of the principle that this Court, in conducting judicial review, may ascertain whether a jurisdictional fact exists, but not conduct an evaluation of such a fact.  However, that passage so stated does not assist in understanding what the alleged shortcoming was in the particular circumstances of this case.  It is important to pay careful heed to the nature of the decision being made and the overall legislative scheme into which it fits.  It was not a final determination of rights, such as by the grant or refusal of a visa.  Rather, it was a decision as to whether extradition proceedings should take place, at which time the issues could be heard in an adversarial setting, albeit administrative in nature and only within the limited ambit provided for by the Extradition Act.  The threshold at the s 16 notice stage was confined to the question of whether the request related to an “extraditable person”, including, relevantly, whether Mr Liem met that definition by reason of being a person “accused of having committed” the “extradition offence[s]”.  48    It is necessary to examine the submission that was before the Minister in order to determine whether there is substance to the complaint made on behalf of Mr Liem.  The immediate impression does not bode well for the assertions made on his behalf.  The first page of the two-page submission to the Minister, five lines beneath the Minister’s signature, states that “Mr Liem is wanted in Indonesia for prosecution for embezzlement and money laundering offences allegedly committed between 2011 and 2015”.  Given the findings at [40]-[42] above, that summary accurately reflected a view that could legitimately be formed about the relevant substance of the request material.  The submission then states that the Department’s advice was that the statutory preconditions had been met in relation to those offences, and that it was considered appropriate to exercise the discretion to issue the s 16(1) notice.  49    The second page of the submission to the Minister repeats that Mr Liem is wanted for prosecution for the same two offences, adding a reference to the offence provisions.  The nature of the case against Mr Liem is concisely summarised immediately after that.  50    The Minister was entitled to rely on a summary of the material before him: see Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40; 162 CLR 24 at 30-31; Williams v Minister for Justice and Customs [2007] FCAFC 33; 157 FCR 286 at [21].  There was no legal bar to the Minister relying upon sufficiently accurate and comprehensive summaries of information prepared by Departmental officers:  see Carrascalao v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2017] FCAFC 107 at [41] and [61].  51    The minimum content of a submission to a decision-maker is necessarily determined by the context in which it arises, both factual and legal, as framed by the statutory provision under consideration.  Not much was required of the submission to the Minister in the circumstances of this case, especially given the narrow ambit and purpose of the decision to be made under s 16 of the Extradition Act, leading to the extradition hearing before the magistrate.  There was no requirement that the submission to the Minister provide competing or alternative interpretations of the request material, as might be required as part of the duty of utmost good faith (uberrima fides) to disclose all material facts to a judicial decision-maker, of the kind stated in Thomas A Edison Ltd v Bullock (1912) 15 CLR 679 at 682, when seeking ex parte curial relief.  What is required is no more than information that, if necessary in combination with the request material itself, addresses the question of whether the statutory test for the s 16 decision to give notice that a request has been received, has, in substance, been met: see Lego Australia Pty Ltd v Paraggio (1994) 52 FCR 542 at 555-6, 566D-E.  As decided in Lego, where there has been an omission of relevant material (in that case, by a person seeking the issue of a search warrant), the test is whether the material that was before the decision-maker was sufficient to meet the statutory conditions for the decision to be made.  That threshold was met in relation to the concise submission before the Minister concerning Mr Liem.52    The issue of inadequacy of the material to meet the statutory test has already been determined adversely to Mr Liem.  No more detail was required in the submission to the Minister in relation to issuing the notice under s 16(1) of the Extradition Act.  Quite properly, no suggestion was made of want of good faith in the submission before the Minister.  The suggestion that there was a material omission in the submission to the Minister is not made out.  53    It follows that ground 7, the third judicial review ground, must fail.Ground 8 – fourth judicial review ground: denial of procedural fairness in being heard on whether the applicant was or was not “accused of having committed the extradition offences”54    The submissions for Mr Liem in relation to the fourth judicial review ground, made orally and in writing, were to the effect that while it was accepted that any procedural fairness obligation was reduced to “nothingness” in the context of the operation of s 16 (citing Marku v Minister for Home Affairs (No 2) [2013] FCA 1015; 216 FCR 315 at [44]-[45]), a procedural fairness obligation was enlivened anew by the deficiencies of the material put before the Minister, and the subsequent failure of the Minister to “properly, fairly and without exaggeration” consider the material.  It was therefore submitted that the insufficiency of the material caused a want of procedural fairness, with reference made to Navarrete v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1723 (per Allsop J, as the Chief Justice then was).55    In response, the Minister submitted, orally and in writing, that a complete reading of Gordon J’s reasons in Marku at [44]-[45] provided support for the proposition that procedural fairness was reduced to “nothingness”, by nature of the power under s 16(1) and the potential for that power to be frustrated or rendered ineffective should procedural fairness obligations operate.  However, her Honour’s reasons did not support the applicant’s proposition that procedural fairness obligations are enlivened anew when the material put to the Minister fails to “properly, fairly and without exaggeration direct the Minister”.  It was submitted that, in any case, the material before the Minister “did not exaggerate, or describe inaccurately”, the circumstances described in the extradition request, and that the applicant had provided no particulars in this regard.  It was further submitted on behalf of the Minister that the case of Navarette did not assist the applicant, as it related to a different statutory scheme which imported an express requirement to afford procedural fairness.  56    The submissions for the Minister should be accepted.  In Marku at [45], Gordon J made it clear that there is no procedural fairness obligation at the s 16 notice stage for the compelling reasons stated by her Honour as follows:In addition, the requirement to observe procedural fairness is reduced to “nothingness” because the Act contemplates that a notice may be given under s 16 in relation to a person to whom the extradition request relates (1) before any application is made for a provisional arrest warrant in relation to that person (as occurred here); (2) before the person may have entered Australia; or (3) even before the whereabouts of the person are known.  That construction finds further support in the express terms of the Act.  Section 16(3) of the Act expressly provides for the person to be given a copy of the s 16 notice “as soon as practicable after the person is remanded under s 15 or the [s 16] notice is issued, whichever is the later” (emphasis added).  This section reveals a legislative intention that the person the subject of the request will not be given prior notice of the receipt of the extradition request or of the Minister’s intention to issue a notice under s 16 stating that a request has been received.  At a practical level that is not surprising.  As Cooper J said in Foster v Attorney-General (Cth) (1997) 97 A Crim R 560 at 575-576: Nor, in my view, do the rules of natural justice or procedural fairness require that a magistrate or the Attorney-General disclose to the person against whom extradition is sought prior to exercising the powers under s 12 or s 16 that a request from an extradition country has been received and give that person an opportunity to respond.  For to do so may render ineffective or frustrate the process: Johns v Australian Securities Commission at 431; Kioa v West at 615.57    As determined above in relation to the first and second judicial review grounds, the extradition material supported the conclusion that Mr Liem was a person “accused of having committed” the “extradition offence[s]”, such that the statutory test for the purposes of s 16 of the Extradition Act was capable of being met by the request material.  Secondly, as determined above in relation to the third judicial review ground, there was no material omission in the submission before the Minister and, in particular, no obligation to provide competing or alternative interpretations of the request material, such as to suggest that Mr Liem was not a person “accused of having committed” the “extradition offence[s]”.  Both the request material itself and the summary of it in the submission to the Minister were sufficient for the Minister to be satisfied that the statutory test in s 16, as read with s 6, had been met.  Thirdly, there was no procedural fairness obligation to give Mr Liem an opportunity to argue, at the s 16 notice stage, that the statutory test had not been met by reason of him not being a person “accused of having committed” the “extradition offence[s]”, and no such obligation was created by the content of the submission to the Minister.  58    It follows that ground 8, the fourth judicial review ground, must fail.The statutory appeal grounds as pleaded and an overview59    The statutory appeal under s 21 of the Extradition Act is confined to the material that was before his Honour (with no such material having been excluded in this instance).  60    Section 19(1) of the Extradition Act provides that, if a person is on remand under s 15, notice has been given under s 19, an application has been made to a magistrate or eligible Federal Circuit Court judge by or on behalf of either the person or the requesting country for proceedings to be conducted and the magistrate or judge considers that the parties have had reasonable time in which to prepare for the conduct of such proceedings, then proceedings shall be conducted to determine whether the person is eligible for surrender.  There is no issue that those preconditions for the conduct of the s 19 hearing were met, remembering that s 19 proceedings are administrative rather than judicial.  61    Section 19(2) of the Extradition Act provides that a person is only eligible for surrender if, inter alia:(1)    the “supporting documents” in relation to the extradition offence have been produced to the magistrate or judge, defined to include “a duly authenticated statement in writing setting out the conduct constituting the offence”: s 19(2)(a) and (3)(c)(ii); and(2)    the magistrate or judge is satisfied that:… if the conduct of the person constituting the offence in relation to the extradition country, or equivalent conduct, had taken place in the part of Australia where the proceedings are being conducted and at the time at which the extradition request in relation to the person was received, that conduct or that equivalent conduct would have constituted an extradition offence in relation to that part of Australia: s 19(2)(c).62    The first requirement under challenge concerns the need for a “conduct statement” that describes what Mr Liem is alleged to have done.  The second requirement under challenge is commonly referred to as “dual criminality”, which essentially reflects the principle that Australia will not surrender a person to a foreign state except for conduct that constitutes a criminal offence in the part of Australia from which extradition is sought and which is serious enough to have a maximum penalty of at least 12 months’ imprisonment.63    Ground 4 in the amended originating application, being the fourth ground of the statutory appeal asserting that the magistrate failed to give reasons, was abandoned at the commencement of the hearing.  The remaining three grounds of the statutory appeal, expanded by leave, were as follows:1.    The Magistrate erred in holding that ‘Attachment C’ to the extradition request was capable of being considered as part of the “duly authenticated statement in writing setting out the conduct constituting the offence” required by section 19(3)(c)(ii) of the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth).2.    The Magistrate erred in holding that the “duly authenticated statement in writing setting out the conduct constituting the offence” required by section 19(3)(c)(ii) of the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth) and provided by the First Respondent, satisfied the requirement in section 19(2)(c) of the Act that, “if the conduct of the person constituting the offence in relation to the extradition country, or equivalent conduct, had taken place in the part of Australia where the proceedings are being conducted and at the time at which the extradition request in relation to the person was received, that conduct or that equivalent conduct would have constituted an extradition offence in relation to that part of Australia”.3.    The Magistrate erred in holding that the extradition request contained a “statement in writing setting out the conduct constituting the offence” required by section 19(3)(c)(ii) of the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth).64    The above three statutory appeal grounds will now be addressed in turn.Ground 1 – first ground of statutory appeal: alleged error by the magistrate in holding that the “Police Investigators Report” was capable of being part of the statement of conduct required by s 19(3)(c)(ii) of the Extradition Act65    In relation to the first ground of the statutory appeal, the following submissions were made on behalf of Mr Liem:(1)    An exhaustive list of documents that “must” be provided to the presiding magistrate in support of an extradition request is prescribed by article 11(2) of the extradition treaty between Indonesia and Australia (being in the schedule to the Extradition (Republic of Indonesia) Regulations 1994 (Cth)).  One such prescribed document is a “statement of the acts or omissions which are alleged against the person in respect of each offence”: art 11(2)(a).  This treaty requirement was inferred to be reproduced in s 19(3)(c)(ii) of the Extradition Act by the requirement that the magistrate be provided in the s 19 proceedings with “a duly authenticated statement in writing setting out the conduct constituting the offence”. (2)    The “Attachment C” document, which took the form of a “Police Investigators Report” and was included in the “Statement of Alleged Conduct”, did not fall within the category of documents that could permissibly be provided to and considered by the magistrate.  Although the Full Court in McDade v United Kingdom [1999] FCA 1868 held at [30] that a conduct statement could include attachments and could be in the form of multiple documents, it was submitted that further case law of the Full Court of this Court had resolved the question of whether “witness statements and other material of an evidentiary nature can constitute a conduct statement” in the negative, citing De Bruyn v Republic of South Africa [1999] FCA 1344; 96 FCR 290 and Bennett v Government of the United Kingdom [2000] FCA 916; 179 ALR 113.  (3)    The “repetitive and convoluted material that is the ‘police investigators report’, whether it be of evidentiary value at trial or not” should have been disregarded in determining whether the dual criminality requirement is met because it was not a conduct statement or any part of such a statement.(4)    The third respondent magistrate had therefore erred in taking Attachment C into account in making the s 19 determination.66    In response, the respondents (that is, Indonesia and the Minister, excluding the magistrate) submitted the following:(1)    A fair reading of Attachment C revealed that it did not include witness statements or documents that would have evidentiary value at trial.  Rather, Attachment C summarised witness statements and evidence, but did not of itself constitute or attach individual witness statements or other evidentiary material.  Thus the conclusions reached in De Bruyn and Bennett were of no application to Attachment C.(2)    It bears repeating, as accepted by Mr Liem through his legal representatives, that a conduct statement may be constituted by a number of documents, and a conduct statement has no set form.  This was an “appropriate recognition” of the variance in different legal frameworks and the manner in which extradition documentation may be drafted by foreign authorities, citing Timar v Republic of Hungary [1999] FCA 1518 at [63], in which Weinberg J observed:It must also be recognised, however, that documents emanating from countries with which Australia has extradition arrangements will often be drafted in language and style which is very different from our own, and perhaps less than perfect from our perspective.  Whether or not those documents can be said to meet the requirements of the Act is, as Gummow J observed in Wiest [Wiest v Director of Public Prosecutions (1988) 23 FCR 472], a matter for practical judgment.  Such documents must, in my opinion, be read fairly, and not perversely.(3)    Paragraphs 15 to 21 of the extradition request, under the heading “Statement for alleged conduct done by Ronny Liem”, formed part of the conduct statement, yet had been ignored in advancing this ground of appeal.  67    It was thus submitted by the respondents that there was no error on the part of the magistrate in taking Attachment C into account in making the s 19 determination, and that this ground of appeal must therefore fail.68    By way of reply submissions on behalf of Mr Liem, it was asserted that the respondents had not addressed the correct issue or question.  The issue or question was not whether Attachment C was a witness statement or included material of evidentiary value, but rather whether Attachment C was a conduct statement or not for the purposes of s 19(2)(a) and (3)(c)(ii) of the Extradition Act.  It was submitted that even if Attachment C was not a witness statement, it would not necessarily constitute a conduct statement as required.  It was further submitted by way of reply that the basis for the respondents’ apparent position that Attachment C would not have any “evidentiary value at trial” was unclear, given the differences presented by the Indonesian civil law system.  In this regard, it was submitted on behalf of Mr Liem that there was no meaningful distinction between a “witness statement” and a document such as Attachment C that purports to summarise what witnesses have told police.69    The resolution of this dispute requires a careful examination of how the alleged conduct by Mr Liem has been described in order to determine whether it meets the requirements of s 19(2)(a) and (3)(c)(ii) of the Extradition Act.  The body of the request describes Mr Liem’s conduct as follows (emphasis in original):Statement for alleged conduct done by Ronny Liem15.    Ronny Liem is the Director of PT. Indonesia Konsorsium Investama (PT. IKI), a stock trading company, from 2011 until 2015, pursuant to Notarial Deed Number 134 dated 29 May 2006, issued by Public Notary Edison Jingga, SH.16.    Sometime between 25 February 2011 and 10 April 2015, Ronny Liem as the President Director of PT. IKI, instructed Marlin (a Financial Staff of PT. IKI) and Vinewati (Accountant of PT. IKI) to gradually deliver to himself 134 papers of cheque.17.    Ronny Liem ordered Marlin and Vinawati to issue those cheques without going through the procedure that has been determined by PT. IKI, such as financial control and consultation.18.    In 2015, it was found that Ronny Liem has cashed those cheques and he never pay for it to PT. IKI. According to Financial Division, the PT. IKI has suffered a big loss amounted Rp. 131,995,995,000 (one hundred thirty one billion nine hundred ninty [sic] five million and nine hundred ninety five thousand rupiah).19.    Ronny Liem used the PT. IKI’s money for his personal purposes and according to further investigation it was known that those funds were used for establishing his new businesses.20.    Indonesia National Police has conducted examination of witnesses to 8 (eight) persons, which are: Mr. Abu Hermanto (Shareholder), Mr. Gooi Whuang Pheal alias Clement Gooi (Consultant), Mr. Marlen (Financial), Ms. Vinawati (Accounting), Ms. Suci Rusdiyati (Bank Officer), Mr. Hansen (Bank Officer), Mr. Donny (Receiver), Mr. Agus Sukoco (staff). Based on witnesses’ statements and the foregoing evidence as to the suspect Ronny Liem, there is strong allegation of embezzlement and money laundering as defined by Article 374 Indonesian Criminal Code, and Article 3 and 4 Law Number 8 of 2010 on Money Laundering Crime Prevention and Eradication.21.    The police investigation report is attached (ATTACHMENT C).70    The incorporation by reference to attachment C to the request, being the police report, means that the conduct statement is not comprised by one or the other, but by both.  The submissions for Mr Liem are to the effect that the police report aspect is so deficient that it should not have formed part of the composite material that was before the magistrate and thereby available, in combination, to constitute the required conduct statement.  While the argument for Mr Liem effectively seeks to have the two sources of information as to the conduct allegedly engaged in by him read in isolation from one another, they properly can and must be read together so as to form the necessary overall impression.71    The police investigation report (attachment C to the request) describes the case in general terms as:(1)    Mr Liem requesting 134 cash cheques through a woman in the finance department and a woman in the accounts department of the company of which he was director, without complying with the company’s disbursement procedure; and(2)    based on statements obtained from the branch manager of two banks, Mr Liem had disbursed to himself or to his benefit:(a)    45 cash cheques totalling IDR 41,560,995,000 from one bank; and (b)    89 cash cheques totalling IDR 90,435,000,000 from the other bank.72    The police report then describes the nature of the evidence that nine witnesses are able to give.  That narrative may be briefly summarised as follows:(1)    The evidence of the first witness is that of the “President Commissioner” and shareholder of the company who had recruited Mr Liem because of his experience in a “future trading company”, being the business of the company.  He is able to give evidence that the authority to expend cash or incur [expenses] rested with the Board of Directors, including Mr Liem.  He can describe the procedure that was required to be adopted.  He can give evidence that the required procedure was not complied with by Mr Liem.(2)    The second witness is a financial consultant with the company and can give evidence, inter alia, that when Mr Liem requested the 134 cash cheques, he said he would furnish and complete the necessary documents and approvals in accordance with company procedure but had never done so.  He can also give evidence about the authority to expend cash or incur [expenses] that rested with the Board of Directors, including Mr Liem, and describe the procedure required to be adopted.  (3)    The third witness worked in the finance department of the company and, along with other formal details, can give evidence about the extent of the loss to the company based on a summary by the finance and accounting department supported by an independent auditor’s report.(4)    The fourth witness is also from the finance department of the company and can provide further details of the reporting requirements in relation to expenditure and the absence of the obtaining of any payment approval prior to the 134 cheques being drawn.  It seems that he can produce the internal records of the company.(5)    The fifth witness worked in the accounting department of the company and describes the way in which Mr Liem had obtained the payment of the cheques without complying with company procedures.(6)    The sixth witness was a head teller at one of the banks involved, whose responsibilities included supervising payment transactions and the withdrawal and transfer of money by customers.  The witness can give evidence about bank records in relation to the transactions.  (7)    The seventh witness also worked at one of the banks and can produce the account opening records for an account opened by Mr Liem.  He can also produce bank account statements for 89 transactions.(8)    The eighth witness was a former co-worker of Mr Liem who had worked with him in the past at another company.  He can give evidence of receiving money from Mr Liem over 20 transactions that were given to him to manage and run a business in South Jakarta.(9)    The ninth witness worked at the company, with his main duties being to deliver documents and perform transactions upon the instructions of the company accountant.  He is able to describe how a number of the cheques were disbursed and can produce a number of documents.73    All of the details provided in the police report about the evidence that the nine witnesses could give also serve the function of describing Mr Liem’s conduct.  The report is not, on its face, in form, or in substance, evidence.  To the contrary, the report expressly described the evidence that each witness can give, along with describing documentary evidence that they can also give evidence about or produce.  The documentary evidence obtained is also described.  Overall, the police report describes Mr Liem’s conduct in relatively simple terms, albeit with quite a lot of detail and repetition.74    The request passage reproduced above, as well as the police report of the evidence that nine witnesses are able to give (as briefly summarised at [72] above), in combination describe Mr Liem:(1)    using his position at the company to bypass usual requirements for the drawing of 134 cheques;(2)    making unfulfilled promises at least some of the time to provide the necessary paperwork later; and (3)    later using at least some of the proceeds of the cheques for his private business affairs.  As has already been observed, there is nothing wrong with reading those two documents together.  There was nothing wrong with the police report forming part of the conduct statement.75    While it is fair to say that the conduct description in the request and in the police witness evidence summary is not as clear or concise an account of Mr Liem’s conduct as it might have been, there is little difficulty in discerning the essential nature and extent of what he is alleged to have done.  The information was ample to meet the necessary statutory description of a “statement in writing setting out the conduct constituting the offence[s]”.  76    It follows that ground 1, the first ground of the statutory appeal, must fail.Ground 2 – second ground of statutory appeal: alleged error by the magistrate in reaching a conclusion as to satisfaction of the dual criminality requirement77    This ground of appeal concerns the requirement imposed by s 19(2)(c) of the Extradition Act that, in determining eligibility for surrender, the magistrate be satisfied that dual criminality has been established.  That is, the magistrate needed to be satisfied that, if the conduct alleged to have been engaged in by Mr Liem in Indonesia had taken place in New South Wales on 23 January 2017, it would have constituted an “extradition offence”.  78    The term “extradition offence” is defined in s 5 of the Extradition Act as an offence against a law of Australia or part of Australia for which the maximum penalty is at least 12 months’ imprisonment.  Section 10(3) of the Extradition Act provides, for the purposes of s 19(2)(c), that if the conduct consists of two or more acts or omissions, regard may be had to all or only one or some of them, and that any difference in offence denomination or categorisation is to be disregarded.79    It was submitted on behalf of Mr Liem that the magistrate had erred in reaching a positive conclusion as to the dual criminality requirement on the basis of the “duly authenticated statement in writing setting out the conduct constituting the offence” provided by Indonesia, this relevantly being the extradition request itself and the annexed and incorporated police report.  The arguments made by counsel for Mr Liem in relation to the two classes of offences for which extradition was sought were as follows:(1)    In relation to the alleged money laundering offence, it was submitted that Indonesia did not contend that the applicant was eligible for extradition based on any like offence under Australian law.  It was submitted that the use to which the moneys were put, or the conduct alleged by Indonesia (as set out in the conduct statement), would only be of evidentiary or sentencing relevance if an offence in respect of the conduct leading to the obtaining of the moneys was made out under New South Wales law.  Indonesia could not, however, “suggest that later use of the funds is conduct forming an essential element of either Fraud or Breach of Director’s Duties”.  It was therefore submitted that the conduct statement did not go to the essential elements of any like money laundering offence or its equivalent in Australian law.  Rather, it went to a factor that was supposedly irrelevant for the present purposes of the dual criminality determination, being the later use of the moneys obtained.(2)    In relation to the alleged embezzlement offence, it was submitted on behalf of Mr Liem that the conduct statement failed to make out an essential element of the offences of fraud and breach of directors’ duties – namely, acting with fraudulent or dishonest intent – and that the conduct statement did not necessarily support that inference.  It was also asserted that the additional elements of the directors’ duties offence were not alleged within the conduct statement.  It was submitted that the conduct statement failed to suggest that Mr Liem made deceptive representations prior to obtaining the moneys, such that the nexus in the fraud offence between deception and the obtaining of the moneys was absent.80    In support of those submissions, the applicant referred to the test articulated by Weinberg J in Timar at [64] as to:… whether the document relied upon sets out the essential elements of each offence for which the surrender is sought, clearly identifies the provisions of the foreign law creating the offence and the maximum penalty prescribed for a breach thereof and gives sufficient particularity to ensure that the requested State and the person whose surrender is sought are left in no doubt as to the basis upon which the requisition is made.81    The submissions for Mr Liem cited several further authorities to suggest that although a decision-maker is permitted to draw inferences as to what is alleged, whether this can be done to the requisite standard would depend on the precise conduct alleged and its context.  In particular, in relation to the drawing of inferences as to the mens rea element of an extradition offence, reliance was placed on O’Donoghue v Ireland [2009] FCAFC 184; 263 ALR 392 at [46]-[49].  Particular reliance was placed on the requirement stated in O’Donoghue at [46] that drawing such an inference must be based on “a fair reading of the materials with regard to the serious consequences attaching to extradition”.  Reliance was also placed on the proposition restated in O’Donoghue at [48] that an arrest warrant should make it sufficiently clear that a state of mind necessary to constitute an extradition offence did exist, without needing to specify the state of mind expressly. 82    Mr Liem also relied on Assange v Swedish Prosecution Authority [2011] EWHC 2849 at [57] (applied at [76] of that judgment), wherein the High Court of England and Wales stated that while it was not necessary to identify in the description of the conduct the mental element or mens rea required under the law of the jurisdiction from which extradition was sought, merely enabling an inference to be drawn as to the existence of that state of mind was not enough.  Rather, the material must “impel” the inference that the alleged acts were committed with the requisite mens rea, in the sense of being the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the facts alleged.  It was submitted that this reasoning was consistent with Zoeller v Federal Republic of Germany (1989) 23 FCR 282 and Linhart v Elms [1988] FCA 205, and that, given the serious consequences attached to extradition, the existence of the essential element of mens rea should not be a matter of speculation in determining the dual criminality requirement.83    It was therefore submitted on behalf of Mr Liem, in relation to the embezzlement offence, that there was insufficient particularity in the material before the magistrate as to the essential element of mens rea (in that the existence of the requisite mens rea was not the only reasonable conclusion available) and, further, that a requisite actus reus element was not made out.  For those reasons, the applicant submitted that the dual criminality element in relation to the embezzlement offence had not been made out, and the magistrate had therefore erred in concluding positively as to the dual criminality requirement being made out on this offence, as well as in relation to the money laundering offence.84    In response, the respondents submitted, orally and/or in writing, that the arguments advanced on behalf of Mr Liem mischaracterised the dual criminality requirement as necessitating a direct equivalence between the Indonesian offences for which the applicant’s extradition was sought, and the Australian offences relied on by the magistrate.  It was submitted that Mr Liem had sought to correlate:(1)    the Indonesian money laundering offence directly with the Australian fraud offence; and (2)    the Indonesian embezzlement offence directly with the Australian breach of directors’ duties offence.  The respondents submitted that what was actually required was “duality of criminality in substance”.  Rather than comparing offences, the correct approach was to make a comparison between “the conduct itself” and “the offence under the law in force in New South Wales” (emphasis in the written submissions for the respondents). 85    The respondents submitted that the approach of duality of criminality in substance (rather than in form) resolved Mr Liem’s contention that the requisite mens rea of fraudulent or dishonest intent had not been made out in relation to the embezzlement offence.  Furthermore, the respondents submitted that Mr Liem’s argument as to insufficient particularity of mens rea in the embezzlement offence ignored a “myriad of facts” in the conduct statement that provided both evidence and inferences as to the applicant’s dishonesty, to a standard sufficient to satisfy the mens rea elements of the NSW laws.  Reliance was placed in this regard on the terms of s 192E of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and s 184 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), which are considered below.  The respondents further submitted that little weight should be placed by this Court on Assange, given its concern with a wholly different statutory regime and the fact that it does not reflect Australian authority on the operation of s 19(2)(c) of the Extradition Act.86    By way of reply submissions for Mr Liem, it was asserted that the respondents’ characterisation of the applicant’s approach to the dual criminality issue was erroneous, and that the true submission of the applicant was that “when the conduct statement is assessed against suggested offences applying in NSW dual criminality is not made out”.  This was said to be the process of comparison required by the Extradition Act.  87    The reply submissions for Mr Liem also sought to dismiss the respondents’ suggestion that a “myriad of facts” was available in the conduct statement from which to draw evidence or inference as to mens rea.  It was reiterated that the conduct statement does not give “sufficient particularity to ensure that the requested State and the person whose surrender is sought are left in no doubt as to the basis upon which the requisition is made”, citing Klepp v Gibb (1988) 81 ALR 383 at 393.88    The question of dual criminality comes down to an assessment of whether the conduct alleged to have been engaged in by Mr Liem, if carried out in New South Wales on 23 January 2017, would have constituted an offence under either of the offence provisions relied upon by the respondents, disregarding labels and characterisation, namely:(1)    fraud, contrary to s 192E of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW); or(2)    breach of directors’ duties, contrary to s 184 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth),including in relation to the subsequent use of the money that was obtained.  89    The terms of s 192E of the Crimes Act are relevantly as follows:192E    Fraud(1)    A person who, by any deception, dishonestly:(a)    obtains property belonging to another, or(b)    obtains any financial advantage or causes any financial disadvantage,is guilty of the offence of fraud.Maximum penalty: Imprisonment for 10 years.…90    The written submissions for Indonesia before the magistrate on this offence were as follows (maintaining original footnotes in the text):66.    The terms “deception” and “dishonestly” are central to the operation of this offence.67.    “Deception” is defined in s 192B. It is the intention inducing of a state of mind which the accused knows does not accord with fact.28 A deception may be by words or conduct.68.    “Dishonesty” is defined s 4B of the Crimes Act to mean “dishonest according to the standards of ordinary people and known by the defendant to be dishonest according to the standards of ordinary people.”69.    The deception must be the effective cause of obtaining the money or financial advantage, as, “…it is an essential ingredient of the offence created by that section that the cause of the payment of the money (or handing over of the valuable thing or the giving of the financial advantage) was the deception used by the accused.”2970.    The deception must operate on the mind of the person to whom it is directed.30  It is irrelevant whether the person deceived has the ability to discover the truth of the facts behind the deception.  The deception employed must precede the obtaining.71.    Numerous witnesses give accounts that the Respondent stated he would furnish and complete the relevant documents and approvals in accordance with PT. IKI’s processes, but never did so.31  Such statements were made to Mrs Marlin and Mrs Vinawati, and preceded his obtaining the cheques.  The statements did not reflect the Respondent’s true intention, which was to use the cheques to fund the establishment of his other businesses.  As a result, the Respondent plainly obtained a financial advantage for himself.28    Corporate Affairs Commission v Papoulias (1989) 20 NSWLR 503 at 506.29    R v Ho (1989) 39 A Crim R 145 at 147.30    R v Laverty [1970] 3 All ER 432; R v Kovacs [1974] 1 WLR 370; R v Davies [1982] 1 All ER 513.31    Attachment C, Indonesia National Police progress report, page 12, paragraph 6; page 16, paragraph 6; page 50, paragraph 5.91    The written submissions for Mr Liem before the magistrate were as follows (maintaining original footnotes in the text):No Statement of Deception Causation of the Obtaining81.    It is further an essential ingredient of the offence against section 192E that a deception by the accused was an actual operative cause of the payment of money or handing over of a valuable thing.482.    The conduct statement does not allege a deception of anyone, let alone one sufficiently causatively related to the obtaining of a benefit such as to amount to the commission of a fraud offence contrary to section 192E.4    R v Ho (1989) 39 A Crim R 145, R v Clarkson [1987] VR 96292    The magistrate was entitled to accept the submissions for Indonesia and reject those for Mr Liem.  The alleged conduct by Mr Liem was that he secured the payment of money to him by persuading employees to do as he asked.  By doing so, he was implicitly representing that the money was required for a proper purpose of the company, when in fact, on the case sought to be brought against him, it was for his own purposes.  The gravamen of the alleged conduct was deception.  It constituted the necessary causal connection between his conduct and the receipt of the money.  He is alleged thereby to have obtained property belonging to the company, being money derived from the cash cheques, or otherwise obtained a financial advantage, again being the money derived from the cash cheques.  93    The relevant state of mind is that of dishonesty.  If Mr Liem was proven to have engaged in the alleged conduct in New South Wales, a strong, if not inescapable, inference was that this was done dishonestly.  There is nothing in the material to suggest any benign state of mind in what presents on its face as a reasonably flagrant fraud.  An important aspect of emphatically showing that state of mind would be proof of personal receipt or use of the money to which he had no entitlement, both of which were asserted in the request material.  The apparent availability of that evidence also goes to showing the obtaining of the property or financial advantage.  The suggestion that mens rea could not be demonstrated is therefore impossible to accept.  This is a matter of ordinary and reasonable inference, not speculation.94    The terms of s 184(1) and (2) of the Corporations Act are as follows:184    Good faith, use of position and use of information—criminal offencesGood faith—directors and other officers(1)    A director or other officer of a corporation commits an offence if they:(a)    are reckless; or(b)    are intentionally dishonest;and fail to exercise their powers and discharge their duties:(c)    in good faith in the best interests of the corporation; or(d)    for a proper purpose.Note:    Section 187 deals with the situation of directors of wholly-owned subsidiaries.Use of position—directors, other officers and employees(2)    A director, other officer or employee of a corporation commits an offence if they use their position dishonestly:(a)    with the intention of directly or indirectly gaining an advantage for themselves, or someone else, or causing detriment to the corporation; or(b)    recklessly as to whether the use may result in themselves or someone else directly or indirectly gaining an advantage, or in causing detriment to the corporation.95    The written submissions for Indonesia before the magistrate on this offence were as follows (maintaining footnotes from the original text):75.    The obligation to act in good faith requires directors to not misappropriate the company’s assets for themselves, including, for example, by paying company money into a personal account.3276.    In relation to the conduct allegedly engaged in by the Respondent, he was at all relevant times a “director” of PT. IKI and was a member of its board of directors.  The Indonesia National Police progress report, which is Attachment C of the Extradition Request, states that the Respondent used his position to obtain cash cheques from Mrs Marlin and Mrs Vinawati.  He did not comply with PT. IKI’s process for issuing those cheques. The cheques were then deposited into his accounts, and the funds were used to establish his other businesses.77.    For those reasons the conduct allegedly engaged in by the Respondent would amount to the offence of misuse of position, contrary to s 184 of the Corporations Act.32    See eg, Nicholls v The Queen [2016] VSCA 300.96    The written submissions for Mr Liem before the magistrate were as follows:83.    The Applicant further submits that the conduct statement would amount to an offence contrary to section 184 of the Corporations Act 2001(Cth), which creates an offence and states:[Text of s 184(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) – reproduced above at [94]]84.    This submission fails on the simple basis that the conduct statement does not allege:•    Recklessness•    Intentional dishonesty•    An exercise of power/discharge of duty not in good faith in the best interests of the corporation•    An exercise of power/discharge of duty not for a proper purpose97    Again, the magistrate was entitled to accept the submissions for Indonesia and reject those for Mr Liem.  The conduct alleged to have been engaged in by Mr Liem entails him using his position as President Director of PT. IKI to procure the drawing of cash cheques for very large sums of money over 134 transactions.  The material clearly discloses at least an implied allegation that in doing so, he actively exercised his powers and discharged his duties in a manner that was obviously absent good faith, not in the best interests of the company and did not entail any apparent proper purpose.  The material necessarily implies that he failed to observe the proper exercise of powers and discharge of duties.  The state of mind in doing so unavoidably could and most likely would be inferred to be dishonest, and intentionally so.  It went well beyond any concept of recklessness.  This, again, was not a matter of speculation, but rather a reasonable inference to draw.  An aspect of the conduct in obtaining the money either by him or to his benefit goes to the proof of both the physical and fault elements of the offence, such that the conduct alleged to constitute money laundering in Indonesia in this case falls within the ambit of the s 184(1) offence.98    For completeness, and by parity of reasoning, the conduct alleged to have been engaged in by Mr Liem also constituted him obtaining an advantage for himself or others and doing so intentionally.  Again, an inference of dishonesty is inescapable, with the conduct alleged going well beyond the lesser offence of doing so while being reckless as to the result.  99    While specific reference was not made to domestic money laundering offences, which are designed to capture dealing with money that is the product of criminal activity without needing to show participation in that prior illegal conduct, reliance could also have been placed on at least the lowest level of money laundering offending as a federal offence, being s 400.9(1) and (1A) of the Criminal Code (Cth).  Those provisions make it an offence to deal with money or other property where it is reasonable to suspect that the money or property is the proceeds of crime.  If the aggregate value of the money or property is less than $100,000, the maximum penalty includes imprisonment for two years.  If the aggregate value is $100,000 or more, the maximum penalty includes imprisonment for three years.  Thus, although the money laundering aspect was effectively covered as part of the fraud and directors’ duties offences, they also amply made out domestic federal money laundering offences as well.100    It follows that there is little reason to doubt that if Mr Liem had engaged in the conduct described in the extradition materials at the time the request was made, he would have committed both of the offences relied upon by the respondents, including as to mens rea.  Accordingly, there was no error on the part of the magistrate in being satisfied as to dual criminality being established.101    It follows that ground 2, the second ground of the statutory appeal, must fail.Ground 3 – third ground of statutory appeal: alleged error by the magistrate in holding that Indonesia had provided a statement of conduct of the nature required by s 19(3)(c)(ii) of the Extradition Act102    On the third ground of the statutory appeal, the applicant submitted that the conduct statement provided as part of the s 19 proceedings did not warrant the description of being “a statement in writing setting out the conduct constituting the offence”, as required by s 19(3(c)(ii) of the Extradition Act and, as such, that s 19(2) had not been satisfied.  The difference between this ground of appeal and ground 1 is that this ground attacks the totality of the material, whereas ground 1 attacked only the police report.  However, that approach was rejected as part of the reasoning towards the conclusion that ground 1 had to fail.103    The applicant again relied upon McDade to submit that the requisite standard of specificity in a conduct statement had not been met by the document tendered for that purpose, because the relevant acts and omissions could not be reasonably identified in that document.  This argument was made weaker by the very case it cited, McDade.  The Court in that case at [17], as extracted in the submissions for Mr Liem, referred to the Zoeller principle of satisfaction as to whether a document is a conduct statement being a “matter of practical judgment and assessment, not for over-zealousness in discerning deficiencies”.  That is, however, precisely how the submissions for Mr Liem appear to have approached this issue.  Notwithstanding that incongruity, it was submitted on behalf of Mr Liem that the conduct statement was too “vague and general” by the standard outlined in McDade in respect of the alleged obtaining and use of the 134 cheques, and that this was particularly so given that the allegations were said to arise from 134 transactions over a period of five years.  It was therefore submitted that the magistrate erred in holding that a “duly authenticated statement in writing setting out the conduct constituting the offence” had been provided in satisfaction of s 19(3(c)(ii), and thereby s 19(2), of the Extradition Act.104    In response, the respondents submitted that the applicant’s submissions as to the conduct statement being too “vague and general” ignored the repetitive and straightforward nature of the alleged conduct.  That conduct simply involved Mr Liem:(1)    ordering financial staff of the company to issue cheques to him without going through the appropriate company procedures; (2)    cashing the cheques; (3)    not reimbursing the company; and (4)    using the money for his personal purposes to establish a new business.105    The respondents further submitted that the contentions on behalf of Mr Liem overlooked or ignored the detail of the offences provided by Attachment C to the extradition request, which could and should be read in conjunction with the conduct statement.  In combination, it was submitted that those documents plainly established that, had the conduct taken place in NSW, it would have constituted the offences of fraud contrary to s 192E of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and breach of directors’ duties pursuant to s 184(1) and/or (2) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).  The Minister thus submitted that the elements of s 19(2) had been duly satisfied, that there was no error on the part of the magistrate in this regard and that this ground must accordingly fail.106    The respondents’ submissions must be accepted, applying the same reasoning as for ground 1, the first statutory appeal ground.  The conduct alleged is repetitive, but it was far from sophisticated or even particularly complicated.  While the description of Mr Liem’s conduct was somewhat more prolix than required, the content was not, in substance, deficient as alleged.  It may be observed that the conduct alleged involved a very common form of employee fraud or misuse of position in a company, the experience of which in Australia has been described in many criminal sentence and appeal cases.  Conduct of this kind relies on relatively basic departures from routine practices and procedures.  Financial staff in such circumstances may be the unwitting means by which such a simple scheme is implemented, not being able to see each step in combination as constitutes the overall fraud or misuse of position.107    The premise of this ground of statutory appeal was ultimately misplaced.  The conduct statement must contain the essential necessary information with sufficient clarity overall.  It does not have to do so by prose that is necessarily quick or easy to read.  The relevant passages of the request itself (reproduced above) and the police report are ample descriptions of the kind required.  108    It follows that ground 3, the third ground of the statutory appeal, must fail.Conclusion109    As all four grounds of judicial review and all three grounds of statutory appeal maintained at the appeal hearing must fail, the amended originating application must be dismissed with costs.I certify that the preceding one hundred and nine (109) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Bromwich.Associate: Dated:    10 November 2017",2017-11-10 00:00:00,Federal Court of Australia

The challenge was brought under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) and s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth).  The parts by which limited success was achieved by the appellant are not the subject of any cross-appeal.  2    The introduction to the primary judge’s reasons succinctly encapsulated the nature and difficulty of the case confronting his Honour as follows:1    This matter concerns a scenario that is all too frequently encountered when search warrants are employed to facilitate the investigation of complex commercial or tax-related criminal offences.  That scenario involves three potentially problematic features.  The first feature is the issue and utilisation of so called “three condition” search warrants which define the object of the search in a broad, non-specific fashion.  The warrants are often lengthy, overly complex and, regrettably, sometimes poorly drafted.  The second feature is that the execution of the warrants is frequently, and unavoidably, carried out by teams of officers, many of whom have had little or no past involvement in the relevant investigation.  The officers accordingly have little or no background knowledge or experience to assist them in the often complex and difficult task of executing the warrants.  That frequently results in the execution of the warrants in a manner which is apt to create the perception, at least, that the officers do not really know what they should be searching for or seizing, and are instead simply seizing anything that looks even remotely like it might be relevant to the investigation.  The third feature is that the execution of the warrants these days almost invariably involves the search and seizure of computer equipment and electronic data storage devices.  [Those] circumstances [require] the executing officers, or forensic officers who are assisting them, to navigate the labyrinthine statutory provisions that deal with the search and seizure of such items.  2    The confluence of these three features often results in a judicial review challenge, by the occupier of the premises that were the subject of the warrants, or persons otherwise affected by the execution of the warrants (usually the target of the criminal investigation), to both the issue and execution of the warrants in question.  Orders are generally sought for the return of the items said to have been unlawfully seized.  Frequently that comprises a vast quantity of material.3    That is what has occurred in this matter.Overview3    On 27 January 2015, search warrants in respect of six premises and two motor vehicles were obtained by officers of the Australian Federal Police (AFP) in aid of a joint tax fraud investigation being conducted with officers of the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) in Western Australia.  The search warrants were issued by a magistrate in Perth, acting administratively as an “issuing officer”, upon the basis of an affidavit sworn by one of the AFP officers on 23 January 2015.  Execution of those search warrants commenced on 28 January 2015.  A significant quantity of material was seized over the course of three days.  A further search warrant was later issued on 4 March 2017, based upon an affidavit which annexed the prior affidavit and provided additional information.  That further search warrant was executed on 5 March 2017. 4    On 4 February 2015, the principal natural person who was the target of the investigation, Allen Caratti, commenced judicial review proceedings in this Court against the Commissioner of the AFP, challenging the lawfulness of the issue of the search warrants, their validity on their face, and their execution.  The Court was informed by counsel for the Commissioner that the seized material has not been examined pursuant to an undertaking given to Mr Caratti.  Accordingly, this aspect of the investigation has stalled pending the outcome of these proceedings, giving rise to a delay of well over two and a half years.  5    Following an extended trial over six days before the primary judge, involving numerous witnesses and detailed submissions from the parties, the primary judge reserved and subsequently delivered a lengthy and detailed judgment.  Although no adverse findings were made by his Honour as to the honesty or moral propriety of the officers involved, substantial criticisms were levelled against the poor drafting of the search warrants, going well beyond the introductory comments by his Honour reproduced above.  6    Despite the criticisms of the primary judge, Mr Caratti’s application mostly failed.  Only limited findings were made as to the unlawfulness of seizure of certain items of electronic equipment.  This reflected a failure by the AFP to comply with the legislative scheme, which mandates a particular process for copying and examining data on electronic equipment, and special conditions for seizure of the equipment itself where copying is impracticable.  Although orders were made for the return of the relevant electronic devices, his Honour also made ancillary orders permitting the data on the hardware to be copied before that equipment was returned, and for the copied data to be examined and potentially used by the AFP, in the manner contemplated by the legislative scheme, for the purposes of the investigation.  The declarations and orders made by his Honour are reproduced below.7    The conclusions reached by the primary judge leading to the dismissal of most of the judicial review challenge were conveniently summarised at the end of his Honour’s comprehensive reasons as follows: SUMMARY OF FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS 481    Following is a brief summary of the findings and conclusions relevant to Mr Caratti’s challenge to the issue and execution of the search warrants.482    The search warrants were validly issued.  The information before the issuing officer was sufficient to support a finding that there were reasonable grounds for suspecting that there was, at the relevant premises, things with respect to which there were reasonable grounds for suspecting that they would afford evidence as to the commission of the offences set out in the third condition of the warrants.  Mr Caratti has not proved otherwise.  The search permitted by the warrants did not exceed what was justified by the material before the issuing officer.  These findings are subject to the finding in relation to the storage medium paragraph.483    The search warrants were valid on their face.  The warrants sufficiently specified the perimeters within which materials were able to be searched for and seized.  They were capable of sufficiently informing the occupiers of the relevant premises of the authorised area of search and seizure.  While the descriptions of the offences to which the warrants related, in the third condition of the warrants, were poorly drafted and, to a certain extent, lacked clarity and particularity, they were nonetheless sufficient for the purposes of a search warrant under s 3E of the Crimes Act.  These findings are also subject to the finding in relation to the storage medium paragraph. 484    The storage medium paragraph in the warrants (the three lines after the third condition) was invalid.  It purported to authorise the seizure of electronic devices (as opposed to the data stored on them) that did not comprise evidential material and in circumstances where the condition in s 3L(3)(a) was not satisfied.  The storage medium paragraph is, however, able to be severed from the warrants.  That paragraph did not form part of an inseparable context and, if the paragraph was severed, the warrants would not operate differently or produce different results from that which was intended.  To the extent that any items may have been seized in reliance on this paragraph, the seizure of those items was appropriately dealt with in the context of Mr Caratti’s specific challenge to the seizure of those items. 485    The warrants as a whole were lawfully executed in accordance with their terms. They were not unreasonably or excessively executed by the executing officers or constables assisting.  These findings are subject to the findings concerning the seizure of individual items comprising computers or electronic storage devices or equipment.486    A number of items of electronic equipment were unlawfully seized.  Those items were the Compaq and Toshiba laptops seized at the Cornish Turn premises; the external hard drives seized by Mr Khan at the Wickham Street premises; the Seagate and Imation storage devices seized by Mr Ilett at the Wickham Street premises; and the Strontium and TDK storage devices seized at the Duncraig Road premises.  Those items (as opposed to the data stored on them) did not constitute evidential material as specified in the warrants.  There were no reasonable grounds for suspecting that the items (as opposed to the data stored on them) would afford evidence of the offences specified in the warrants.  No seizing officer formed the view that there were such reasonable grounds.  Seizure was therefore not authorised by s 3F(1)(c) of the Act.  Nor were the items able to be seized under s 3L(2)(a) because the condition or circumstances in s 3L(3)(a) was not satisfied.  There was nothing to suggest that it was not practicable to copy the data on these devices.  No seizing officer formed the view that it was impracticable to copy the data.487    The Court should not, in the exercise of its discretion, order the return of the items of electronic equipment that have been found to have been unlawfully seized until the Commissioner, through his officers, is given an opportunity to further inspect and, if satisfied in terms of s 3L(1A), copy the data pursuant to s 3L(1A)(a) of the Act.  The items should then be returned.  The further inspection and copying of the data should occur within a reasonable time and (if Mr Caratti so requests) in the presence of Mr Caratti or his representatives.  The parties should have leave to have the matter relisted if any dispute arises in relation to the further inspection of the equipment and the copying of the data.8    The final declarations and orders made by the primary judge on 23 November 2016 were as follows (omitting definitions and explanatory notes):THE COURT DECLARES THAT:1.    The words which appear immediately after the third condition of the warrants which read “Together with any storage medium or storage device which contains any of the above things and any manual, instruction, password or other thing which is needed to gain access to or interpret or decode any of the above things” (the storage medium paragraph) are invalid.2.    The storage medium paragraph is severable from the balance of the warrants.3.    The electronic devices listed in Annexure A to these orders (the electronic devices) were not lawfully seized pursuant to either s 3F or s 3L of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (the Act) on the execution of the warrants.THE COURT ORDERS THAT:1.    The first respondent (or an officer or officers authorised to do so on his behalf) may inspect the copies made, subsequent to the execution of the warrants, of the data contained on the respective electronic devices identified in paragraphs 1-4 of Annexure A to these orders and, if he or she suspects on reasonable grounds that any data within any of the respective copies satisfies the three conditions of the warrants, retain the copied data from the respective electronic device.2.    The further inspection of the data pursuant to order 1 above should (unless otherwise ordered) occur within 28 days of the date of these orders (unless another period is agreed between the parties) and in the presence of the applicant or his or her authorised representative (if the applicant so requests). For this purpose, the first respondent (or an officer authorised to do so on his behalf) shall liaise with the applicant to determine a mutually convenient time (or times) within the period of 28 days from the date of these orders.3.    Upon completion of the steps set out in orders 1 – 2 above:3.1    the electronic devices referred to in paragraphs 1-3 of Annexure A be returned to the occupier of the premises from which the electronic devices were seized; and3.2    unless the first respondent is entitled to retain the copied data as set out in order 1 above, the copied data shall be removed from any device in the control of the Australian Federal Police and destroyed as soon as practicable.4.    If the first respondent is satisfied that the data retained as provided in order 1 above is not required (or is no longer required) for a purpose mentioned in section 3ZQU of the Act or for other judicial or administrative review proceedings, the first respondent must arrange for:4.1    the removal of the data from any device in the control of the Australian Federal Police; and4.2    the destruction of any other reproduction of the data in the control of the Australian Federal Police.5.    Leave is granted to the parties to have the matter relisted on 24 hours’ notice if any dispute arises in relation to the matters provided for in orders 1-4 above.6.    The applicant’s Second Further Amended Originating Application and the claims in the Applicant’s Further Amended Points of Claim are otherwise dismissed.7.    The applicant pay 75% of the first respondent’s costs as agreed or assessed on an ordinary basis.8.    The applicant pay the third respondent’s costs as agreed or assessed on an ordinary basis.9    On 2 December 2016, Mr Caratti appealed from the orders made by the primary judge, including in respect of his Honour’s declaration as to the severability of a portion of the warrant, and as to the orders permitting copying and inspection of the data on the electronic devices found to be unlawfully seized.  He sought, as he did in the Court below, to have the search warrants set aside and all of the seized material returned.  Even if the outcome of the appeal were to result in findings only of partial invalidity, he contended that this should not result in severance and that all of the seized material should be returned.  As a final alternative, he contended that the use of any material permitted to be retained should be restricted.  The Commissioner defended the primary judge’s reasons and conclusions without qualification.  In doing so, the criticisms and adverse conclusions as to the search process were not challenged.10    In substance, Mr Caratti revisited the case as was ultimately run in the Court below, with a number of key initial grounds having been abandoned before the primary judge.  He asserted error in relation to the key findings of the primary judge on the grounds that were litigated to conclusion.  In those circumstances, it is important to keep in mind that while this appeal was a rehearing, the finding of error on the part of his Honour was indispensable.  It is not enough that this Full Court would have reached a different conclusion on any topic that was fairly open to his Honour: see the restatement of the rehearing principles in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Reckitt Benckiser (Australia) Pty Ltd [2016] FCAFC 181; 340 ALR 25 at [44]-[56], especially at [50].11    Mr Caratti advanced five grounds of appeal, the full text of which is reproduced as each is considered below, asserting that the primary judge erred in:(1)    concluding that the “perimeters” of the search areas specified in the warrants were sufficiently precise, an argument that turned on the description given to the suspected offences in the search warrants;(2)    finding that the search perimeters permitted by the warrants did not exceed what was reasonably justified by the material before the issuing officer, again turning on the offence description as compared to the information in the affidavit relied upon to obtain the search warrants;(3)    considering that an offence in the third condition of the warrants might be severable;(4)    finding that the warrants were lawfully executed; and(5)    permitting the further copying and examination of data copied from electronic equipment that was found to have been unlawfully seized.12    For the reasons that follow, each ground of appeal should fail and, accordingly, the appeal should be dismissed.  The conclusions by which the primary judge arrived at the declarations and orders reproduced at [8] above, while being far from inevitable, were fairly available to his Honour.  The necessary error has not been established in any respect.  That conclusion is reached having regard to:(1)    the terms of the search warrants and supporting affidavit construed by his Honour in the confined manner required for the purposes of judicial review of administrative action;(2)    the evidence before his Honour, including significant cross-examination and involving credit assessments, having regard also to the onus on the appellant;(3)    the terms of the legislation, properly interpreted; and (4)    the substantial body of authority guiding the determination of the various challenges made.13    The ultimate success of the Commissioner in this litigation is cause for sober reflection, rather than complacent satisfaction.  The primary judge’s criticisms as to the drafting of the search warrants have been endorsed and enlarged upon at the conclusion of these reasons, with further views expressed as to the steps that might be taken in the future to avoid the delays, problems and issues in this case that have been caused or compounded by the deficiencies in the process.Legislative scheme – Part 1AA of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) 14    The relevant power to issue a search warrant under the Crimes Act arises from s 3E, although it is to be read in light of several collateral provisions.  In summary terms, under s 3E(1) it is open to an issuing officer to issue a search warrant if the information provided on oath or affirmation is capable of satisfying him or her of the substance of the two limbs required, namely, that:(1)    there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that there is, or there will be within the next 72 hours, at the relevant premises;(2)    anything with respect to which there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that it will afford evidence as to the commission of the offence or offences to which the warrant relates.15    The details in the legislation leading to the above summary overview require more detailed exposition.  The provisions reproduced below provide a comprehensive regime for the application for a search warrant, its issue, and the powers it bestows, including additional powers granted by statute collateral to a valid warrant’s express scope.16    Sections 3E(1), (5) and (6) of the Crimes Act are in the following terms:3E    When search warrants can be issued(1)    An issuing officer may issue a warrant to search premises if the officer is satisfied, by information on oath or affirmation, that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that there is, or there will be within the next 72 hours, any evidential material at the premises.…(5)    If an issuing officer issues a warrant, the officer is to state in the warrant:(a)    the offence to which the warrant relates; and(b)    a description of the premises to which the warrant relates or the name or description of the person to whom it relates; and(c)    the kinds of evidential material that are to be searched for under the warrant; and(d)    the name of the constable who, unless he or she inserts the name of another constable in the warrant, is to be responsible for executing the warrant; and(e)    the time at which the warrant expires (see subsection (5A)); and(f)    whether the warrant may be executed at any time or only during particular hours....(6)    The issuing officer is also to state, in a warrant in relation to premises:(a)    that the warrant authorises the seizure of a thing (other than evidential material of the kind referred to in paragraph (5)(c)) found at the premises in the course of the search that the executing officer or a constable assisting believes on reasonable grounds to be:(i)    evidential material in relation to an offence to which the warrant relates; or(ii)    a thing relevant to another offence that is an indictable offence; or(iii)    evidential material (within the meaning of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002) or tainted property (within the meaning of that Act);if the executing officer or a constable assisting believes on reasonable grounds that seizure of the thing is necessary to prevents its concealment, loss or destruction or its use in committing an offence; and(b)    whether the warrant authorises an ordinary search or a frisk search of a person who is at or near the premises when the warrant is executed if the executing officer or a constable assisting suspects on reasonable grounds that the person has any evidential material or seizable items in his or her possession.…17    The expression “evidential material” used in various parts of s 3E is defined in s 3C as meaning “a thing relevant to an indictable offence or a thing relevant to a summary offence, including such a thing in electronic form”.  The expression “thing relevant to an indictable offence” is further defined in s 3 as follows:thing relevant to a summary offence means:(a)    either of the following:(i)    anything with respect to which a summary offence against any law of the Commonwealth or of a Territory has been committed or is suspected, on reasonable grounds, to have been committed;(ii)    anything with respect to which a State offence that has a federal aspect, and that is a summary or simple offence against the law of that State, has been committed or is suspected, on reasonable grounds, to have been committed; or(b)    anything as to which there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that it will afford evidence as to the commission of any such offence; or(c)    anything as to which there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that it is intended to be used for the purpose of committing any such offence.18    The scope of the authorisation conferred by a search warrant issued under s 3E is relevantly set out in s 3F of the Crimes Act as follows:3F    The things that are authorised by a search warrant(1)    A warrant that is in force in relation to premises authorises the executing officer or a constable assisting:(a)    to enter the warrant premises and, if the premises are a conveyance, to enter the conveyance, wherever it is; and(b)    to search for and record fingerprints found at the premises and to take samples of things found at the premises for forensic purposes; and(c)    to search the premises for the kinds of evidential material specified in the warrant, and to seize things of that kind found at the premises; and(d)    to seize other things found at the premises in the course of the search that the executing officer or a constable assisting believes on reasonable grounds to be:(i)    evidential material in relation to an offence to which the warrant relates; or(ii)    evidential material in relation to another offence that is an indictable offence; or(iii)    evidential material (within the meaning of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002) or tainted property (within the meaning of that Act);if the executing officer or a constable assisting believes on reasonable grounds that seizure of the things is necessary to prevent their concealment, loss or destruction or their use in committing an offence; and(e)    to seize other things found at the premises in the course of the search that the executing officer or a constable assisting believes on reasonable grounds to be seizable items; and(f)    if the warrant so allows—to conduct an ordinary search or a frisk search of a person at or near the premises if the executing officer or a constable assisting suspects on reasonable grounds that the person has any evidential material or seizable items in his or her possession.…19    The phrase “seizable items” is used in numerous places in the provisions quoted above, but has no application to this case as it is defined in s 3C to be “anything that would present a danger to a person of that could be used to assist a person to escape from lawful custody”.20    Section 3L of the Crimes Act provides for the use of electronic equipment that is at premises being searched, or has been brought onto premises by those executing a search warrant or assisting in its execution.  It also provides restrictive criteria by which such equipment found at premises may be seized.  Importantly, and of particular relevance to this appeal, s 3L(3) provides that such equipment may only be seized if it is not practicable to copy the data on the equipment in accordance with s 3L(1A) or if possession of the equipment could constitute an offence.  Section 3L(1A) is relevant to the decision that was taken to seize computer equipment from certain of the premises, conduct that the primary judge found to be unlawful, a conclusion that is not challenged by the Commissioner.  Section 3L(1A) is also relevant to the formulation of the remedy for this situation arrived at by his Honour.  It provides as follows:If the executing officer or constable assisting suspects on reasonable grounds that any data accessed by operating the electronic equipment constitutes evidential material, he or she may:(a)    copy any or all of the data accessed by operating the electronic equipment to a disk, tape or other associated device brought to the premises; or(b)    if the occupier of the premises agrees in writing—copy any or all of the data accessed by operating the electronic equipment to a disk, tape or other associated device at the premises;and take the device from the premises.Challenges to search warrantsGeneral principles21    Statutes providing for the issue and execution of search warrants generally reflect a balance struck by legislatures between the need to protect the individual from arbitrary invasions of privacy and property, and the public interest in an effective criminal justice system: George v Rocket (1990) 170 CLR 104 at 110.3.  The proper issue and execution of search warrants plays a vitally important role in an effective criminal justice system by facilitating the gathering of evidence that can, in appropriate cases, lead to the apprehension, prosecution, conviction and punishment of those who have broken the criminal law.  22    By authorising an overriding of such private interests in certain circumstances, search warrant legislation gives primacy to the public interest in the administration of criminal justice while also recognising the need for appropriate but limited protection of individual rights through the imposition of statutory conditions for the issue of a valid warrant.  Strict compliance with those conditions is therefore required in order to give effect to that statutory purpose: George v Rocket at 110-111.  However, in construing the statutory requirements for the issue of a search warrant, the Court should be careful to give effect to the legislation by its terms, and not approach its task armed with a prima facie hostility to the invasion of privacy that is necessarily involved in the exercise of investigative powers: Hart v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police [2002] FCAFC 392; 124 FCR 384 at [68].  Construction of statutes that authorise the search of premises and the seizure of things from them must begin with “the ordinary meaning of the words considered according to their context and the legislative purpose”: Hart at [64].  23    Importantly, the search and seizure provisions of the Crimes Act are not punitive and are therefore not to be treated as penal provisions for the purposes of statutory construction:  Hart at [67].  Rather, it is appropriate to see those provisions as subject to the general principle that, in the absence of unmistakeable and unambiguous language, it is to be presumed that the legislature has not intended to interfere with basic rights, freedoms and immunities: see, e.g., Hart at [67] and the cases there cited.  For example, in Coco v The Queen (1994) 179 CLR 427, the High Court considered that, in the absence of a clearly manifested intention to do so, the relevant legislation authorising the issue of a warrant to use a listening device did not also authorise such use where installation of such a device would otherwise constitute a trespass: see, in particular, Coco at 437-8.  24    For modern search warrant legislation, the same strict compliance with the relevant statutory requirements may generally be seen to apply, but no further.  Additional rights or requirements going beyond those spelt out are not easily to be inferred.  As was pointed out in Hart at [65], “effect must be given to importance attached by the legislature to the use of search warrants as an important and legitimate tool in the detection and prosecution of criminal offences”, such that a construction giving effect to “operational realities” is to be preferred to “fine legal judgments in the issue and/or execution” of search warrants.  25    In Lee v New South Wales Crime Commission [2013] HCA 39; 251 CLR 196 at [312]-[314], the High Court considered the principle affirmed in Coco that a court will not impute to Parliament an intention to abrogate basic rights, freedoms and immunities unless such an intention is clearly manifested by unmistakeable and unambiguous language.  In the context of examination powers in aid of the confiscation of criminally-obtained assets, but applicable also in the search warrant context, the High Court observed:312    More recent statements of the principle in this Court do not detract from the rationale identified in Potter, Bropho and Coco but rather reinforce that rationale (541).  That rationale not only has deep historical roots; it serves important contemporary ends.  It respects the distinct contemporary functions, enhances the distinct contemporary processes, and fulfils the shared contemporary expectations of the legislative and the judicial branches of government.  As put by Gleeson CJ in Electrolux Home Products Pty Ltd v Australian Workers’ Union (542), in terms often since quoted with approval (543), the principle “is not merely a common sense guide to what a Parliament in a liberal democracy is likely to have intended; it is a working hypothesis, the existence of which is known both to Parliament and the courts, upon which statutory language will be interpreted”.  Gleeson CJ pointed out that the principle is to be applied against the background that “modern legislatures regularly enact laws that take away or modify common law rights” and that the assistance to be gained from the principle “will vary with the context in which it is applied” (544).313    Application of the principle of construction is not confined to the protection of rights, freedoms or immunities that are hard-edged, of long standing or recognised and enforceable or otherwise protected at common law.  The principle extends to the protection of fundamental principles and systemic values.  The principle ought not, however, to be extended beyond its rationale: it exists to protect from inadvertent and collateral alteration rights, freedoms, immunities, principles and values that are important within our system of representative and responsible government under the rule of law; it does not exist to shield those rights, freedoms, immunities, principles and values from being specifically affected in the pursuit of clearly identified legislative objects by means within the constitutional competence of the enacting legislature.  314    The principle of construction is fulfilled in accordance with its rationale where the objects or terms or context of legislation make plain that the legislature has directed its attention to the question of the abrogation or curtailment of the right, freedom or immunity in question and has made a legislative determination that the right, freedom or immunity is to be abrogated or curtailed.  The principle at most can have limited application to the construction of legislation which has amongst its objects the abrogation or curtailment of the particular right, freedom or immunity in respect of which the principle is sought to be invoked.  The simple reason is that “[i]t is of little assistance, in endeavouring to work out the meaning of parts of [a legislative] scheme, to invoke a general presumption against the very thing which the legislation sets out to achieve” (545).(541)    See Electrolux Home Products Pty Ltd v Australian Workers’ Union (2004) 221 CLR 309 at 329 [20]-[21]; Al-Kateb v Godwin (2004) 219 CLR 562 at 577 [19]-[20]; Australian Education Union v General Manager of Fair Work Australia (2012) 246 CLR 117 at 134-136 [28]-[32].(542)    (2004) 221 CLR 309 at 329 [21].(543)    See, eg, Saeed v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2010) 241 CLR 252 at 259 [15]; Australian Education Union v General Manager of Fair Work Australia (2012) 246 CLR 117 at 135 [30].(544)    See Electrolux Home Products Pty Ltd v Australian Workers’ Union (2004) 221 CLR 309 at 328 [19], citing Gifford v Strang Patrick Stevedoring Pty Ltd (2003) 214 CLR 269 at 284 [36].(545)    Australian Securities and Investments Commission v DB Management Pty Ltd (2000) 199 CLR 321 at 340 [43].26    In the case of the provisions presently under consideration, the balance between the competing public and private interests may be seen to have shifted to afford even greater primacy to the needs of the criminal justice system, having regard to the legislative enlargement of the relevant investigative powers reflected in Part 1AA of the Crimes Act.  A number of features of that detailed regime, stretching over some 100 pages, warrant particular mention:(1)    the power to seize things is no longer confined to the ambit of the warrant itself, because, pursuant to s 3F(1)(d), a valid search warrant permits, on certain conditions, the seizure of evidential material beyond the scope of the warrant if that material relates to an indictable offence or constitutes evidential material within the meaning of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) – this provision may be regarded as a statutory version of the principle stated in Chic Fashions (West Wales) Ltd v Jones [1968] 2 QB 299 at 313, concerning the seizure of material going beyond the scope of a search warrant; see also Ghani v Jones [1970] 1 QB 693 at 706;(2)    other invasive acts further to the search for and seizure of material within the express scope of the warrant are also authorised by s 3F, but are required by s 3E(6) to be stated in the search warrant, including:(a)    searching for and recording fingerprints and taking samples for forensic purposes: s 3F(2)(b);(b)    seizing other things found if there is a belief on reasonable grounds that it is a “seizable item”, defined in s 3C(1) as “anything that would present a danger to a person or that could be used to assist a person to escape from lawful custody”: s 3F(1)(e); and(c)    if provided for in the warrant (which must say so either way), a “frisk search” or “ordinary search” (as defined in s 3C(1)), being a search of a person at or near the premises suspected on reasonable grounds to have any evidential material (not apparently confined to evidential material of the kind described in the warrant) or “seizable items”;(3)    if there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that data on electronic equipment constitutes evidential material, the executing officer may copy all of the data for later examination or, if that is impracticable, seize the electronic equipment: s 3L.  27    The authorisation conferred by s 3F(1)(d) in particular meets and exceeds the common law power to seize and retain material found that is beyond the scope of a search warrant or any other lawful basis for being on premises and obtaining such material: see again Chic Fashions at 313 and the discussion in Ghani v Jones at 708-9.  Before the enactment of s 3F(1)(d), it may have been in doubt that the search warrant provision in the former s 10 of the Crimes Act bestowed any common law power to seize material lawfully beyond the express terms of a search warrant.  28    The presence and comfort of s 3F(1)(d) should give an incentive to police to obtain search warrants that are tightly focussed on the investigation at hand and relying upon suspicions firmly grounded on what is already known or inferred, including as to the nature of the “evidential material” suspected of being present (or to be present in the next 72 hours) that will be likely to advance the investigation.  This will provide discipline and real assistance to those responsible for the execution of a search warrant and clear guidance for occupiers to enable them to ensure that any seizure is appropriately confined either to the search warrant itself, or to the terms of s 3F(1)(d) and (e).  29    Section 3F(1)(d) and (e) provide ample scope for seizing sufficiently probative but unexpected evidence for indictable offences beyond those described in the search warrant.  In such cases, the decision to seize the material may be made by reference to the character of the material found, including any apparent evidential value for the suspected offence(s) or another indictable offence, without the risks attendant upon relying on a wide and imprecise search warrant.  The mere possibility of finding unexpected evidence should not distract police and other investigators from the proper focus on the express purpose of a search warrant, anchored in the suspicions that gave rise to its issue in the first place.30    These additional provisions and, indeed, the other extensions of power in Part 1AA, do not lower the need for strict compliance with the statutory regime, but they do inform the evaluative exercise as to what constitutes strict compliance.  Indeed, while the balance must be seen to have tipped further in favour of law enforcement over privacy and property interests, careful attention to the conditions governing the issue and execution of a search warrant remains necessary to give effect to the statutory balance as struck.  It is only a valid warrant that gives rise to the existence of the extended powers in ss 3F and 3L in a given case.Principles concerning the validity of issue of a search warrant31    The issue of search warrants may be subject to challenge in a number of different ways according to the process adopted and the statutory regime in question.  The two ways that have been the subject of detailed judicial consideration are where the information relied upon for issue of the warrant is said in some way to be incomplete, and where the information is in some way said to be inadequate.  Only the latter – asserted inadequate information – is in issue in this case.  It is, however, worth mentioning the former briefly, because the principles involved serve to demonstrate further the nature of the administrative process and the limitations on judicial review.  32    For a relatively short time, a Full Court decision in Karina Fisheries Pty Ltd v Mitson (1990) 26 FCR 473 at 481 equated, by obiter dicta, a search warrant application with an ex parte curial application, giving rise to a duty of utmost good faith (uberrima fides) to disclose all material facts to the decision-maker, being a duty of the kind stated in Thomas A Edison Ltd v Bullock (1912) 15 CLR 679 at 682.  That heresy by way of false equivalence between executive and judicial processes was firmly displaced by a subsequent Full Court decision in Lego Australia Pty Ltd v Paraggio (1994) 52 FCR 542 at 555-6, 566D-E.  The only judge who sat on both appeals, Hill J, observed that the existence of an obligation to make full disclosure was not the subject of any argument in the appeal in Karina Fisheries, nor was it essential for the decision: see Lego at 564F.  33    As decided in Lego, where there has been an omission of relevant material by a person seeking the issue of a search warrant, the test is whether the material that was before the decision-maker was sufficient to meet the statutory conditions for the grant of the search warrant.  George v Rockett involved such a finding as to the insufficiency of material before the issuing officer, turning on the particular and unusual circumstances in that case.  As with other administrative decisions, however, the issue of a search warrant may also be rendered invalid where fraud or misrepresentation has induced the grant of the warrant, such that the warrant would not have issued but for the misstatement: Lego at 555-6, 569A.  It was considered by Hill J, in a separate judgment, that an actionable deficiency may also be established by want of good faith, but inadvertent omission will not suffice unless sufficiently material: Lego at 570F.  None of those factors were present in this case.34    In all challenges to the validity of the issue of a search warrant, the usual restraints on judicial review intervention will apply.  This includes, most importantly, the principle that the decision manifested in the search warrant issued must be read beneficially, and not with an eye keenly attuned to the perception of error: Minister for Immigration And Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 271-2.  However, application of that principle must accommodate the purposes of a search warrant in informing both those executing it and occupiers as to the scope of the search that is authorised.  The scope of a search warrant may be far from precise given that it is issued for an investigative purpose, based upon the low threshold of “suspicion” being met.  All that really means is that an error or misdescription must be shown to be material to the purposes of a search warrant.  However when it comes to mismatches between the information and the search warrant, that feature must not be approached with undue technicality or any requirement for excessive precision.  Practical considerations must always be kept steadily in mind:  Baker v Campbell (1983) 153 CLR 52 at 83.  Principles concerning invalidity on the face of a search warrant35    Some of the leading and authoritative statements on sufficiency on the face of a search warrant, focussing, as is so often the case, on the description of the suspected offence, are to be found in Beneficial Finance Corporation v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police (1991) 31 FCR 523, a decision of the Full Court, with the main judgment being that of Burchett J.  Sheppard J agreed with Burchett J, while Pincus J only relevantly disagreed to the extent that his Honour would have preferred an even less stringent test for a sufficient offence description than that outlined below.  36    While Beneficial Finance dealt with the much simpler search warrant provision in the former s 10 of the Crimes Act, it nonetheless contains a number of principles that are of continuing application.  Before turning to those passages, it should be observed by way of context that Burchett J considered a range of authority, some of which suggested that a search warrant needed to meet a test purportedly derived from Canadian cases in which it had been held that the “exact object of the search” had to be disclosed.  Such a stringent test was rejected, including by reference to Canadian cases that suggested no such stringency.  This analysis required the statement to that effect by Jackson J in Parker v Churchill (1986) 9 FCR 334 at 348 to be either read down or discarded.  Burchett J also rejected technical arguments based on a strict application of the formal operation of taxation law provisions in a search warrant context, an approach with some resonance to this case, as the primary judge was evidently well aware.37    A number of the key principles to emerge from Beneficial Finance are as follows (with some modernisation of language to fit with that in the current provisions):(1)    Burchett J said at 533.6 (although the change to a dual suspicion test in s 3E should be noted):The authorities make it clear that the statement of the offence in a search warrant need not be made with the precision of an indictment.  That would be impossible, and indeed to attempt it would be irrational, bearing in mind the stage of the investigation at which a search warrant may issue.  The purpose of the statement of the offence in the warrant is not to define the issues for trial; but to set bounds to the area of search which the execution of the warrant will involve, as part of an investigation into a suspected crime.  The appropriate contrast is not with the sort of error which might vitiate an indictment, but with the failure to focus the statutory suspicion and belief upon any particular crime, with the result that a condition of the issue of the warrant is not fulfilled, and it purports to be a general warrant of the kind the law decisively rejected in the 18th century.  …The above passage was quoted with approval by the High Court in State of New South Wales v Corbett [2007] HCA 32; 230 CLR 606 at [99], applying the same reasoning to the State search warrant provision that was under consideration in that case.(2)    Of necessity, the line as to what may and may not be seized cannot be precisely drawn, since a search warrant is not concerned with what is known, but with what there is reasonable grounds for suspecting: Beneficial Finance at 534.3, quoting from his Honour’s prior judgment at first instance in Parker v Churchill, (1985) 9 FCR 316 at 319;(3)    the requirement of particularity in an offence description is directed to ensuring that the occupier knows the object of the search and can therefore make “some assessment of the material likely to prove relevant”, because it is unacceptable otherwise to leave an occupier “in the dark”: Beneficial Finance at 539.3, quoting Toohey J, when a member of this Court in Quartermaine v Netto (unreported, 14 December 1984) – the offence description upheld in Quartermaine was considerably more vague than the offence descriptions in this case, insofar as no date for the suspected offences was identified at all;(4)    given the stage at which a search warrant is granted, it may not be known what particular offences may have been committed, such that it is sufficient that the warrant specifies the suspected offences in such a way as to enable the executing officer and those assisting to decide if the things seized come within the terms of the warrant: Beneficial Finance at 539.5, reproducing the quotation relied on by Toohey J in Quartermaine from Coward v Allen (1984) 52 ALR 320 at 332;(5)    the question of the sufficiency of an offence description should be viewed broadly, having regard to the terms of the warrant in the circumstances of each case, and not answered by the bare application of a verbal formula but, rather, in accordance with the principle that a search warrant should disclose the nature of the offence so as to indicate the area of search, with the precision required varying from case to case: Beneficial Finance at 543.7. 38    In Beneficial Finance, Burchett J rejected a submission that the search warrants in that case were bad for generality, stating at 544 that:They limit the area of search by reference (inter alia) to offences sufficiently described to enable an ordinary reader to understand what are the subjects of the reasonable grounds for suspicion and belief that are recited.  The language may not be elegant.  It may do some violence to a fine appreciation of how the law expressed in s 57AF of the Income Tax Assessment Act should be classified.39    A number of key passages from Beneficial Finance were quoted with approval by the High Court in Corbett, giving the Full Court’s views additional weight.  In particular, approval was given in Corbett at [103] to the conclusion that the question of the sufficiency of the offence description should not be answered by the application of verbal formula.  At [106] in Corbett it was stated that it is the nature of the offence that is critical, which had to be “stated sufficiently to enable the issuing justice to understand the object of the search and to appreciate the boundaries of the authorisation to enter, search and seize”.40    What emerges from Beneficial Finance and the many cases since that have followed, applied or approved it, including Corbett in particular, is a test of sufficiency to indicate the area of search, not precision or particular accuracy.  There is no legal principle creating an abstract test by which the nature and degree of precision in the statement of a suspected offence in a search warrant will be inadequate, such as the term used in submissions of law made on behalf of Mr Caratti of “intolerable ambiguity”.  Whether an offence description is adequate or sufficient – or not – is a matter for assessment in all the circumstances of the case at hand.  It is largely a factual and practical evaluation, which may be affected to a significant degree by context and nuance.  It is substantially a trial determination, rather than an appeal determination, as the subjective nature of the determination will seldom lend itself to being a conclusion that was not open to a primary judge, even if members of an appeal court might have reached a different conclusion.  The above principles make appellate intervention, which is already difficult in many cases, often very hard to achieve in search warrant cases.  That is all the more so when there has been oral evidence, cross-examination, credit assessments and the drawing of inferences.  Those difficulties are compounded by the discretionary nature of the relief that may be granted or refused.41    In the Full Court decision in Dunesky v Elder (1994) 54 FCR 540, four out of five judges upheld the validity of the search warrants under challenge.  The plurality (Lockhart, Beaumont and Hill JJ), with whom Lindgren J agreed (also making further observations on topics not applicable to this case), said at 555E that in was “not impermissible to describe the object of the search in a broad, or non-specific fashion”, and at 557C that the “real object of the third condition is the identification of the kind of offences alleged”.  However, those broad and otherwise useful principles are undermined in this case by the lack of discipline in the drafting of the first two conditions in the present search warrants, placing a heavier burden on the third condition.  Nonetheless, the role of the third condition remains an identification of the kind of offence being investigated.  There is nothing inherently wrong with a search warrant that confines the search to only part of a suspected offence period, or conduct that only relates to a part of the suspected offending.  42    Applying the above principles to cases of the present kind, it may be observed that, conceptually, the investigation and prosecution of an alleged fraud of some kind (using that term in a generic way that includes offences of the kind suspected in this case) commonly requires evidence and proof of what the impugned party represented to be the position, what the true position was, and what difference it made, including questions of deceit or dishonesty in departing from the true position.  In the case of such suspected offences, there will often be material held by the party said to have been defrauded in some way, such as representations made, and what took place as a result of such representations, such as money being paid, or not being required to be paid.  What will be lacking is evidence of what the true position is.  There is nothing wrong with a search warrant that focusses on obtaining evidence as to what is merely suspected to exist for the purposes of contrasting it with what was already known and what had already happened in terms of suspected fraudulent loss.  That may cause the search warrant to be focussed on a particular aspect of the conduct under investigation, including a particular point in time.Principles concerning the invalid execution of a search warrant43    In Dunesky v Commonwealth (1996) 33 ATR 491, Lockhart J was considering a challenge to the execution of the search warrants under challenge, following the upholding of their validity by another primary judge and the Full Court (by a 4-1 majority) and the subsequent refusal of special leave to appeal by the High Court: see Dunesky v Elder in the Full Court for the final resting place of that unsuccessful challenge, as referred to above.  Lockhart J noted at 500:A search warrant is a severe intrusion into a person's privacy, home or place of business.  The law takes care to ensure that the powers of police officers entrusted with the task of executing a search warrant are not exceeded; but at the same time it must be borne in mind that execution of a search warrant is a practical exercise carried out by police officers who, though trained in their task of law enforcement, are generally not qualified lawyers.  Just as a person’s privacy must be respected so must the investigation of criminal offences not be unreasonably impeded.44    After citing a range of authority, including from the High Court, on the need to focus on the practical aspects of search warrant execution, Lockhart J observed at 501:The obligation of police officers executing warrants is to act reasonably in all the circumstances of the case: Crowley v Murphy at FLR 152-5; Bartlett v Weir at A Crim R 518.  The warrant must be executed according to its terms and in accordance with the requirements of s 10 [now s 3E]: Dunesky at FCR 556.  Consideration can be given to what is contained in the information in order to decide whether or not documents fall within the scope of the warrants.  In the present case there was a briefing of the relevant police officers prior to the search; the information together with its attachments was available to the police officers; and the police officers had advice from ATO officers who had been involved in the preceding lengthy audit and who understood the issues.His Honour further observed at 501-2:It is to be remembered in this case, where the classes of documents which may be seized pursuant to the terms of the warrant are wide indeed, that documents will not fail to satisfy the three conditions contained in the warrant merely because (a) they bear dates outside the period of the commission of the alleged offences specified in the warrant; (b) they relate also to persons other than persons revealed by the warrant as being suspected of committing the offences; or (c) they relate to some subject distinct from the matter under investigation.  Documents may meet all three conditions notwithstanding those matters. 45    In order for Mr Caratti to succeed on the aspect of his appeal concerning the execution of the search warrants, he needed to demonstrate that the primary judge strayed impermissibly from the broad evaluative exercise that his Honour was entitled to carry out.Principles concerning severance46    The relevant principles were helpfully and comprehensively summarised by the primary judge as follows, there being no suggestion of any error in his Honour’s survey of the law:Severance 227    In Parker v Churchill, Jackson J found that significant parts of a search warrant that purported to describe the offences to which the warrant related were invalid.  His Honour declared those parts of the warrant to be invalid, but ordered that the invalid parts could be severed from the warrants.   His Honour declared the warrants to be otherwise valid.  His Honour said (at 350): There is no reason why a search warrant granted under s 10 may not include in respect of the same place a number of quite different matters and there is nothing in the section itself to suggest that if one of the matters so included exceeds the powers conferred by s 10, the warrant necessarily fails as to the other matters.  It is possible, of course, that the good and bad parts of the warrants may be so interlinked that one cannot stand without the other but that would usually mean no more than that the parts, as a matter of construction of the warrant, were not truly separate.  Further, as the primary judge said, the authorities suggest that a search warrant, being an order of a justice is divisible and when good in part and bad in part, the good may be divided from the bad, and the good affirmed and the bad quashed: see R v Johnson & Franklin Wholesale Distributors Ltd (1971) 3 CCC (2d) 484; Adler v Attorney-General of Alberta (supra) at 139-140; Abou-Assale v Bourden JSP (1978) I CR (3d) 213 at 231; Coward v Allen (1984) 52 ALR 320 and Brewer v Castles (No 3) (1984) 52 ALR 581.228    Bowen CJ and Lockhart J agreed with Jackson J, other than in respect of one part of the warrant that Jackson J had declared invalid.  It is readily apparent that Bowen CJ and Lockhart J agreed with Jackson J in relation to the question of severance.  They declared that certain parts of the warrant were invalid, but that the warrants were otherwise valid.229    In Beneficial Finance, Burchett J (with whom Sheppard J agreed at 525) considered that it was open to sever parts of a warrant which incorrectly recited the language of the former s 10(1)(a) of the Crimes Act.  His Honour said (at 545).The severability of a search warrant has some importance for the present case because of the argument, further consideration of which I deferred earlier in these reasons, that the warrants contain an inaccurate reproduction of the language of s 10(1)(a) of the Crimes Act, and thus purport to authorise inappropriately the seizure of things ""in respect to which there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that [the suspected offences] have been committed"".  In my opinion, if this portion of the warrants is invalid, it is readily severable.  As there has been no suggestion that any particular document has been, or is likely to have been, seized in reliance upon this portion of either of the warrants, it is unnecessary to decide whether the failure to follow precisely the wording of the statute did have any vitiating effect. I am unable to imagine anything in this case which could be a thing ""in respect to which"" the offence had been committed, yet would not fall within the terms of that part of the warrant which accurately reflects s 10(1)(b).  That has already been made clear in the discussion of the true meaning of the word ""and"" in this very special context.  The reflection of s 10(1)(a) in the drafting of the document cannot, in the circumstances, have made any practical difference to the search or the seizure. It would be an apotheosis of pedantry to refuse to sever the warrant, and to invalidate it on this ground.230    Pincus J agreed “substantially” with the reasons of Burchett J, including that severance of invalid portions of a warrant is appropriate in some circumstances.  His Honour took issue, however, with Burchett J’s view that it was relevant, in the context of severance, that there had been no suggestion that documents had been seized in reliance on the invalid parts.  Pincus J expressed the view (at 526) that it “cannot be incumbent upon the party challenging an executed warrant to show which documents were seized in reliance on particular parts of it”.231    In Peters v Attorney-General for New South Wales (1988) 16 NSWLR 24, McHugh JA followed Parker v Churchill and held that the doctrine of severability applied to warrants that were issued in excess of power.  His Honour noted (at 41D-E), however, that “it is not possible to sever a warrant where the invalid provision forms part of an inseparable context, or would operate differently or produce a different result from that which was intended”.  Perhaps even more importantly, his Honour found that, because warrants are instruments for the purposes of provisions such as s 32 of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW), they are to be read and construed to the extent that they can be read as valid instruments.  The result was to throw the burden upon the person attacking an entire warrant to prove, in effect, that if the invalid part of the warrant was severed, the warrant would have operated differently, or would have produced a different result to that intended.47    It follows that the key issue in determining whether severance can take place is whether the invalid part of the search warrant can be separated from the valid parts remaining.  That is a largely a question of fact.  For Mr Caratti to succeed on this ground of appeal, he must show that the severance conclusion reached by the primary judge was not open to his Honour. 48    The Commissioner’s written submissions also rely upon the terms of s 46(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth), which provide, in relation to instruments other than legislative instruments, notifiable instruments or rules of court:If any instrument so made would, but for this subsection, be construed as being in excess of the authority’s power, it is to be taken to be a valid instrument to the extent to which it is not in excess of that power.49    While s 46(2) tends to reinforce the principles in the cases considered by the primary judge above, it does not gainsay the need for the evaluative exercise as to whether severance is possible.The terms of the search warrants and affidavits in support50    The relevant search warrants were obtained by way of an affidavit of Federal Agent Gary Szolnoki, which was provided on or about 23 January 2015 to a magistrate of the Perth Magistrates Court, acting administratively rather than judicially.  The search warrants sought concerned premises associated with Mr Caratti and Ms Tina Bazzo, his de-facto partner.  The supporting affidavit deposed to a suspicion that Mr Caratti (together, in one instance, with Ms Bazzo) may have committed five tax-related offences through various corporate entities of either obtaining a financial advantage by deception from a Commonwealth entity, or dishonestly causing a loss to a Commonwealth entity, in contravention of ss 134.2(1) or 135.1(3) respectively of the Criminal Code (Cth) (which is in the Schedule to the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth)).  Both offences rely upon a Commonwealth entity having been adversely affected by the conduct.  The Commonwealth entity was erroneously described in the offence descriptions as the Australian Taxation Office: see Different Solutions Pty Ltd v Commissioner, Australian Federal Police (No 2) [2008] FCA 1686; 190 A Crim R 265 at [125]-[128].  However, the primary judge was correct to conclude that nothing of substance turned on this error.  51    Mr Szolnoki’s affidavit advanced the following general narrative before turning to the material relied upon in respect of each of the five offences under investigation (noting that certain parts of the affidavit were redacted by reason of public interest immunity claims, accompanied by a concession by the Commissioner that the content of those passages could not change the result):6.1    In 2008, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) commenced Project CABALLUS to identify risks associated with the principal individuals of the “CARATTI Group”: Allen Bruce CARATTI, born 24 February 1956 (A.CARATTI), his de-facto partner Tina BAZZO, born 24 February 1966 (BAZZO) and his brother John CARATTI (J.CARATTI).  The CARATTI Group are prominent members of the Western Australian business community, primarily concerned with land development and investment.  The ATO estimates that the CARATTTI Group holds equity in commercial and residential property to the value of $726,000,000.  Land holdings by associate companies are estimated to be the largest in the State.6.2    The CARATTI family has a history of non-compliance with the ATO dating back to the 1970’s.  The ATO describe the CARATTI Group as being one of the most difficult syndicates they have investigated due to their wealth, use of numerous privately owned businesses, and intimate knowledge of ATO processes and tax law.  Despite continued scrutiny and repeated ATO audits, A.CARATTI and BAZZO continue to operate in a highly non-compliant manner with respect to their taxation obligations.6.3    In 1991, the ATO referred information to the AFP where it was alleged that A.CARATTI, J.CARATTI and their mother, Madeleine CARATTI (M.CARATTI) were engaged in large scale taxation fraud.  Following a joint AFP/ATO investigation, A.CARATTI, J.CARATTI and M.CARATTI were charged with conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth of $5.8 million.  In June 1999, J.CARATTI was found guilty and sentenced to four and a half years imprisonment.  A.CARATTI and M.CARATTI were found not guilty.6.4    The ATO have advised that between 2000 and 2014, A.CARATTI has been linked with approximately 222 entities (businesses), whether as a Director, some form of office bearer or other connection, and that entities associated with him and BAZZO continue to accumulate considerable wealth even though many report financial losses each financial year.6.5    Since commencing Project CABALLUS, the ATO has issued assessments for outstanding tax liabilities totalling approximately $93,000,000.00 in relation to the non-declaration of income and Goods and Services Tax (GST) by entities controlled by A.CARATTI and BAZZO.6.6    Between May and December 2013, the ATO referred 11 matters to the AFP for investigation alleging that A.CARATTI and BAZZO were committing fraud against the ATO.6.7     Operation CABALLUS is a joint AFP/ATO investigation focusing on four of 11 incidents referred to the AFP by the ATO alleging tax evasion and forgery by A.CARATTI and BAZZO related entities, specifically the alleged avoidance of lawful taxation in relation to land developments by Starbrake Pty Ltd (STARBRAKE), Westend Assets Pty Ltd (WESTEND), Forrest Hope Pty Ltd (FORREST HOPE) and Whitby Land Company (WHITBY).52    The affidavit then turned to the conduct that was said to ground the requisite suspicion in relation to each offence.  That material has been considered further below.53    On 27 January 2015, on the basis of the evidence provided by Federal Agent Sznolnoki, the Magistrate, acting administratively, issued search warrants in respect of the premises at the following identified addresses (the street numbers do not need to be reproduced again here):(1)    Wickham Street, East Perth, being the registered business address of Gucce Holdings and Mammoth Nominees;(2)    Duncraig Road, Applecross, Western Australia, being Mr Caratti’s residential premises and the registered office of Whitby Land Company;(3)    Cornish Turn, Baldivis, Western Australia, being the residential address of Mr Schokker, Mr Caratti’s accountant or tax adviser;(4)    Great Eastern Highway, Redcliffe, Western Australia, being the registered business address of Mammoth Investments; (5)    A unit in Irvin Street, Perth, Western Australia, being the officers of a firm of solicitors that acted for Starbrake in relation to the purchase of the Calloway Street property;(6)    A unit in Main Street, Osborne Park, Western Australia, being the offices of Mr Catanecci, the accountant or tax agent that provided accounting services for Starbrake; and  (7)    Two motor vehicles apparently associated with Mr Caratti and Ms Bazzo.  54    A further search warrant was obtained for premises at Wright Road, Harrisdale Western Australia by an affidavit sworn on 4 March 2015, which annexed a copy of the prior affidavit, and contained additional information.  55    The search warrants issued were in substantially the same terms, except that the warrant for the premises at Wright Road omitted the first two suspected offences from the third condition.  As was the case before the primary judge, differences in the list of persons or companies referred to in the second condition of each warrant do not bear in any material way on the issues raised by Mr Caratti.  It is sufficient to reproduce below, by way of example, the relevant parts of the search warrant executed at Mr Caratti’s residential premises in Applecross, Perth, which was relied on by the primary judge as sufficiently representative for determination of Mr Caratti’s challenges to the warrants generally.56    The first condition of the representative search warrant was as follows:FIRST CONDITIONthings which are:•    Personal or laptop computers and peripheral devices;•    Mobile telephones, Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) Cards, computer hard drives and equipment, faxes or any other electronic storage medium;•    Identification documents; and•    Emails, email addresses, user names and passwords.originals or copies of any one or more of the following, including any of them which are stored on a computer, or on a computer storage device, or on any other type of storage medium or storage device:•    Business records including general correspondence, invoice books, receipts, purchase orders, confirmation of orders, balance sheets, journals, ledgers, cash books, cash payment books, books of accounts, contracts, agreements, diaries, notes including handwritten notes, facsimile communications, address  books, working papers, price lists, quotations, orders, invoices, commercial invoices, tax invoices, business cards, payment records, purchase records, sales records, sales orders, catalogues, delivery dockets, accounts payable, accounts receivable, minutes, telephone records, desk calendars and blotters, single transaction permissions, continuing permissions, computer files or records, electronic mail records and other records;•    Banking and other financial institution records including bank statements, bank books, deposit books, bank vouchers, deposit and withdrawal slips, cheque books, cheque butts, or other correspondence with financial institutions;•    Taxation records, including documents concerning the preparation and completion of business activity statements and taxation returns;•    Notebooks, diaries, telephone numbers, handwritten notes;•    Conveyancing files, including but not limited to contracts of sale, copies of payments, file notes, correspondence with vendor and purchaser, invoices and receipts detailing payments into solicitors trust accounts;•    Trust documents and deeds;•    Trust files; and•    Land title documents.57    It may be observed that the above list of items said to be the subject of the requisite suspicion and to be the material sought to be seized is extremely wide and does not, of itself, meaningfully limit the scope of the search warrant.58    The second condition of the representative search warrant was as follows:SECOND CONDITIONand which relate to any one or more of the following:•    Allen Bruce CARATTI;•    Tina Michelle BAZZO;•    Christina Marcia CARATTI;•    Liang Ll;•    Josephine Lynette BAZZO;•    Rocla Pty Ltd;•    Mammoth Nominees Pty Ltd ACN 101 717 177;•    Mammoth Investments Pty Ltd ACN 008 735 797;•    Joseph Catenacci Pty Ltd ACN 009 025 405;•    Joseph CATENACCI;•    Nicholas CHANDLER;•    Stuart MACKINNON;•    Andy LIU;•    Nancy MUSGRAVE;•    Ewing Consulting Engineers Pty Ltd;•    Isaac Meyer ELLISON;•    Henricus (Hank) SCHOKKER;•    Bendigo Bank account number: [NUMBER REDACTED];•    Bendigo Bank account number: [NUMBER REDACTED] ;•    National Australia Bank;•    Suncorp Metway Bank;•    Bank of Western Australia (Bank West);•    Gucce Holdings Pty Ltd ACN 099 191 714;•    Whitby Land Company Pty Ltd ACN 115 233 193;•    Westend Asset Pty Ltd ACN 106 132 790;•    Forrest Hope Pty Ltd ACN 122 459 554;•    Starbrake Pty Ltd ACN 107 942 058;•    Ashford Taxation;•    Clayton Utz Commercial Law Firm;•    Herbert Smith Freehills;•    Wilson and Atkinson Law Firm;•    I.M.E Nominees Pty Ltd;•    allen@mammothgroup.com.au;•    Gucce Group;•    Admin4@mammothgroup.com.au;•    catenacci@bigpond.com.au;•    lsaac@guccegroup.com.au;•    Nicholas CHANDLER;•    Dfts99@gmail.com;•    [TELEPHONE NUMBER REDACTED]•    [TELEPHONE NUMBER REDACTED];•    Lot 3, Diagram 15871, Certificate of Title Volume 1267, Folio 569;•    Lot 9029 Broadway, Aveley Western Australia 6069;•    SLS Accounting;•    293 Nicholson Road, Forrestdale Western Australia 6112; and•    52 Callaway Street, Wangara, Western Australia 6065.59    Again, it may be observed that the above list not only contains a long list of names, but also a number of other entities and addresses, including law firms.  As with the list in the first condition, this does not, of itself, in a practical sense substantially limit the scope of the search warrant, although it does confine to some degree the ambit of the matters to which the investigation relates.60    The third condition of the representative search warrant was as follows:THIRD CONDITIONand as to which there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that they will afford evidence as to the commission of the following indictable offence(s) against the laws of the Commonwealth:In 2008 at Perth in Western Australia, Allen CARATTI by a deception, in that he reclassified royalty income paid to Starbrake Pty Ltd into a loan from Mammoth Nominees Pty Ltd, dishonestly obtained a financial advantage by not paying income tax, from another person, namely the Australian Taxation Office, which is a Commonwealth entity, contrary to Section 134.2(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 [sic] (Cth).In 2008 at Perth in Western Australia, Allen CARATTI did fail to pass on Goods and Services Tax collected by Starbrake Pty Ltd to the Australian Taxation Office, with the intention of dishonestly causing a loss to another person, namely Australian Taxation Office, which is a Commonwealth entity, contrary to Section 135.1(3) of the Criminal Code 1995 [sic] (Cth).In 2008 at Perth in Western Australia, Allen CARATTI by a deception, in that he falsified costs incurred by Westend Asset Ply Ltd, attempted to dishonestly obtain a financial advantage by not paying income tax, from another person, namely the Australian Taxation Office, which is a Commonwealth entity, contrary to Sections 11.1 and 134.2(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 [sic] (Cth).Between 1 July 2010 and 31 December 2013 at Perth in Western Australia, Allen CARATTI by a deception, in that he caused the Whitby Land Company Pty Ltd to withhold Goods and Services Tax, dishonestly obtained a financial advantage from another person, namely the Australian Taxation Office, which is a Commonwealth entity, contrary to Section 134.2(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 [sic] (Cth).In December 2011 at Perth in Western Australia, Allen CARATTI and Tina BAZZO, by a deception, in that they falsified costs incurred by Gucce Holdings Pty Ltd, attempted to dishonestly obtain a financial advantage by overstating Goods and Services Tax input credits, from another person, namely the Australian Taxation Office, which is a Commonwealth entity, contrary to Sections 11.1 and 134.2(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 [sic] (Cth).Together with any storage medium or storage device which contains any of the above things and any manual, instruction, password or other thing which is needed to gain access to or interpret or decode any of the above things.61    The list of offences in the third condition above is reasonably confined, although subject to challenge as to the manner in which each was expressed, as detailed below.  The third condition was therefore the main means by which the ambit of the search was confined, avoiding at least the vice of being a general warrant necessarily beyond the scope of s 3E of the Crimes Act.  General warrants have been considered to be unlawful in the absence of clear statutory authority since at least the eighteenth century: see Entick v Carrington (1765) 19 State Tr 1029, cited in Ghani v Jones at first instance, [1970] 1 QB 693 at 696.62    It should be observed that all of the search warrants adopted the above three-condition format.  That format was approved by the Full Court in Dunesky v Elder at 557C, and ordinarily operates to confine the ambit of the warrant by reference to the types of things sought, the persons or other entities to which such things relate, and the offences which such things meeting both prior conditions as suspected would afford evidence.  The three-condition format may be thought of visually as a Venn diagram comprising three overlapping circles, each representing the limitations imposed by one of the conditions.  The search warrant only authorises the seizure of those items in the single portion common to all three circles.  As noted above, however, the effective authority conferred by a s 3E search warrant is considerably wider than its search terms, having regard to the incidental seizures that are permitted by s 3F(1)(d) and (e).  This means that there is little basis for concern that a suitably tight and confined warrant will lead to having to leave material behind that is probative either of the offence under investigation or other indictable offences.63    The three-condition format is used to address the difficulty identified by the High Court in George v Rockett that the easier it might be to establish reasonable grounds for a suspicion that a particular thing is at given premises, the harder it would be to establish reasonable grounds for a belief that such a thing, if found, would afford evidence of the commission of an offence, and vice versa.  It should be noted that the provision under consideration in George v Rockett was expressed in terms of suspicion as to specified types of things being present, and belief as to such things affording evidence of an offence, in contrast to the dual suspicion test in s 3E of the Crimes Act, considered further below.  The decision in George v Rockett at 115 is often cited and quoted as to the meaning of suspicion and belief, derived from the prior Privy Council decision concerning false imprisonment in Hussien v Chong Fook Kam [1970] AC 942 at 948 and from the High Court bankruptcy case of Queensland Bacon Pty Ltd v Rees (1966) 115 CLR 266 at 303.  Belief is a clearly higher and more demanding state of mind.  64    The High Court in George v Rockett addressed the stress between the state of mind as to suspicion that an item will be present at premises, and the state of mind as to belief that such an item, if found, will afford evidence of the commission of an offence as follows at 117:… It is by reference to the means of identification of the object of the search that the sufficiency of both reasonable grounds for suspecting and reasonable grounds for believing must be judged.  Where a specific object is identified, the question whether there are reasonable grounds for believing that, if it exists and is found, it will afford evidence as to the commission of an offence is a discrete question to be answered according to the facts set out in the complaint.  Where the object is identified by description, the broader and less specific the description, the more difficult it is likely to be to satisfy the requirement of reasonable grounds for believing that a thing answering the description will afford evidence of the commission of an offence.  Conversely, the narrower and more specific the description, the more difficult it may be to satisfy the requirement of reasonable grounds for suspecting that the designated object is in the particular location. …65    Relevantly, and in contrast to the situation that existed in the legislation under consideration in George v Rockett, s 3E of the Crimes Act does not require “belief”, but rather “suspicion” of the matters stipulated under both of the two limbs of the test.  This is a less advanced or substantial state of mind than belief, and may be established by the existence of “conjecture or surmise”: George v Rockett at 115-6.  The test is dual in nature because s 3E requires that the necessary “suspicion”, and the existence of reasonable grounds to induce that state of mind, be demonstrated in respect of both the likelihood that particular items will be present at the subject premises, and the likelihood that those items, if found, will afford evidence, in the sense of being potentially probative in some way, of a named offence.  66    The three-condition structure approved in Dunesky v Elder and used in the present case works best when a measure of discipline is applied to the ambit of all three parameters, rather than simply including every conceivable type of thing that might be found, and every conceivable entity that might be connected to the matters under investigation in any way, no matter how obscure or improbable.  If the investigation until the point at which a search warrant is obtained permits some precision, it is highly desirable for that to be reflected in the drafting of the search warrant.  It involves writing less, rather than more, albeit with perhaps greater care in the choice of what is listed and what is not.  If the checklist which each condition facilitates is to be of much practical use at the time of execution, the list must be of a workable and sensible length and detail for all three conditions to operate together in an optimal way to address the stress identified in George v Rockett.  In combination, the three conditions should operate to make the assessment of what should and should not be seized easier and quicker.67    In the present case, however, a disciplined approach was not observed in framing the first two conditions of the search warrants, as their terms reproduced above make clear.  Instead, a wide “shopping list” approach was taken, with the evident purpose being to make each as wide and general as possible.  That approach is contrary to the purpose of having the first two conditions to enable the things realistically suspected of being present and relevant listed, but not confined to things that will necessarily afford evidence of the commission of the suspected offences.  Accordingly, those first two conditions were cast in very wide terms, reflecting no real attempt to confine the ambit of the search or contribute in any useful way to informing the relevant occupiers or those executing the search warrants as to the parameters of the search.  All the narrowing or culling work was left to the third condition.  The effect of this, as demonstrated by the nature of the ultimate challenges to the warrants that ensued, was that the burden of adequately defining the ambit of the search authorised by the warrants fell substantially on the description of the suspected offences.  68    If that was a deliberate or strategic choice, it was a very high risk approach to take.  It made the validity of the search warrants more vulnerable to challenge, and their execution more difficult to defend.  In this case, it led to seizures that might have resulted in evidence being ordered to be returned.  Persisting with such an approach could easily lead to that result in a future case and, indeed, risks invalidity and the consequent grounding of causes of action for torts such as trespass and detinue.  If any of the extended frisk powers are used, that could extend to grounding the tort of battery (and perhaps even assault), as the legal substratum authorising such a search would be absent.  69    In this case, the drafting approach also opened up many different avenues of challenge and required reliance on what had taken place prior to the execution of the warrant and in the course of that investigation, rather than the warrant itself being able to do most of the work.  That, in turn, required more witnesses to be called and a protracted hearing to take place, testing to an extent the detail of what had taken place.  Not much of that detail was revisited in the appeal, in part because initial allegations of an improper or unlawful purpose in obtaining the search warrants were not pursued before the primary judge, apparently once the evidence filed for the Commissioner made that approach untenable.  The case ultimately pursued before the primary judge and on appeal relied more heavily on the defects in drafting, although the execution of the search warrants remained an active ground of review on appeal.70    Given the focus in this appeal on the written word, it is convenient to outline the material advanced in the supporting affidavit by separate reference to each of the five offences, save for the first and second offences, which are dealt with together, and the primary judge’s views on what was deposed to.  First and second suspected offences (the Starbrake allegations)Text in the search warrant71    The first and second suspected offences were stated in the third condition of the warrant as follows:In 2008 at Perth in Western Australia, Allen CARATTI by a deception, in that he reclassified royalty income paid to Starbrake Pty Ltd into a loan from Mammoth Nominees Pty Ltd, dishonestly obtained a financial advantage by not paying income tax, from another person, namely the Australian Taxation Office, which is a Commonwealth entity, contrary to Section 134.2(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 [sic] (Cth).In 2008 at Perth in Western Australia, Allen CARATTI did fail to pass on Goods and Services Tax collected by Starbrake Pty Ltd to the Australian Taxation Office, with the intention of dishonestly causing a loss to another person, namely Australian Taxation Office, which is a Commonwealth entity, contrary to Section 135.1(3) of the Criminal Code 1995 [sic] (Cth).Affidavit material for the first and second suspected offences (Starbrake allegations)72    The relevant parts of Federal Agent Szolnoki’s affidavit concerning the first and second offences were as follows:6.8    Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) records indicate that STARBRAKE was registered as an Australian proprietary company on 11 February 2004.  A.CARATTI was recorded as an office bearer of STARBRAKE and held the following positions within the company …6.9    STARBRAKE has an issued share capital of $2.00 comprising two ordinary shares which are beneficially owned by A.CARATTI.…6.11    Western Australian Government Lands Title Office (Landgate) records indicate that in December 2004, STARBRAKE purchased land identified as Lot 3 on Diagram 15871, certificate of title Volume 1267 and folio 569, located at 52 CALLAWAY Street, Wangara, WA, 6065 (CALLAWAY STREET), through a loan acquired via the Suncorp Bank.…6.20    On 8 June 2006, Ray White Valuers provided an initial valuation of the unimproved property located at CALLAWAY STREET.  The valuation states that STARBRAKE is the registered owner of the land, within the valuation it states that Rocla Pty Ltd (ROCLA) have agreed to extract sand at a royalty of $2 per cubic metre with all extraction costs to be paid by ROCLA.  The land valuation was sent to Suncorp Bank, titled Mortgage Finance Valuation by Ray White.6.21    In 2008, STARBRAKE acquired the services of Clayton Utz Commercial Law Firm to prepare a lease agreement with ROCLA.  On 1 July 2008, STARBRAKE granted ROCLA a lease over the land at CALLAWAY STREET and an exclusive licence to carry out extraction of sand on the land.  This lease was signed by A.CARATTI in his capacity as Director of STARBRAKE.  On 1 July 2008 (2009 income year), ROCLA paid a royalty of $7,700,000.00 (inclusive of $700,000.00 of GST) to STARBRAKE for the grant of the licence.  This money was paid into a Bendigo Bank Account in the name of STARBRAKE, account number 633000-0016132912.6.22    On 3 July 2008, $7,200,000.00 was transferred from the above named STARBRAKE account to a second Bendigo Bank account, in the name of MAMMOTH, account number 633000-117556654.  The transfer was described as “Loan / Starbrake P/L”.6.23    At the time of the signing of the lease, STARBRAKE acquired the services of Herbert Smith Freehills lawyers to draft a side deed, between ROCLA, STARBRAKE and Bank of Western Australia (BANK WEST).  Clause 5.1(a)(10) of the deed states that STARBRAKE has received payment of the royalty as prepayment for the contract quality of sand.6.24    On 17 October 2008, STARBRAKE lodged its Business Activity Statement (BAS) for the period of 1 July 2008 to 30 September 2008.  The BAS did not include the $700,000.00 of GST, payable to the ATO, relative to the royalty they had received from ROCLA.  At this time of this lodgment, A.CARATTI was the Director of STARBRAKE.6.25    In February 2012, STARBRAKE lodged its income tax return for the 2009 income year.  The income tax return did not include the royalty of $7,000,000.00 (excluding the $700,000.00 GST) it had received from ROCLA as part of its assessable income.  At this time of this lodgment, A.CARATTI was the Director of STARBRAKE. 6.26    An ATO audit of the financial records of STARBRAKE, being the general ledger, disclosed that the $7,700,000.00 royalty received from ROCLA was recorded as a loan from Mammoth Nominees Pty Ltd (MAMMOTH), an entity related to STARBRAKE by virtue of common directors and shareholdings.  However, financial records of MAMMOTH, obtained by the ATO, did not disclose a loan made to STARBRAKE.6.27    ASIC records indicate that MAMMOTH was registered as an Australian proprietary company on 15 August 2002.  A.CARATTI is recorded as the Director and Secretary of the company.  The registered office is located at 2 Duncraig Road Applecross, WA, 6153, the home address of A.CARATTI.…6.29    The applicant suspects that A.CARATTI directed the reclassification of the royalty received from ROCLA to a loan from MAMMOTH so as to obtain a financial advantage by understating STARBRAKE’s taxable income for the 2009 income tax year.  This resulted in STARBRAKE not paying an estimated $1,800,000 in income tax on the $7,000,000 royalty from ROCLA nor the associated $700,000 GST.73    Thus the allegations under investigation were that in the September quarter of the 2008-2009 financial year, Mr Caratti, in his capacity as the sole director of Starbrake Pty Ltd, directed that $7.7 million received from Rocla Pty Ltd be reclassified as a loan to obtain a financial benefit dishonestly.  The benefit was alleged to have been realised in two ways.  First, the $700,000 payable in Goods and Services Tax (GST) was not declared and remitted as part of Starbrakes’s September 2008 business activity statement.  Secondly, the income of $7 million (net of GST) was not declared in Starbrake’s 2008-2009 tax return.  The two suspected offences focused on the aspect of the 2008 reclassification of the $7.7 million payment, at Mr Caratti’s direction, that gave rise to these two alleged fraudulent tax benefits, rather than upon when documents were lodged with the ATO.  As the primary judge explained:The Starbrake allegations 21    The first group of allegations concerned a company called Starbrake Pty Ltd.  At the relevant time Mr Caratti was a director of Starbrake and beneficially owned all of its shares.  In late 2004 Starbrake purchased land at 52 Callaway Street, Wangara, Western Australia.  In July 2008, Starbrake granted a company called Rocla Pty Ltd a lease and exclusive licence to extract sand from the Callaway Street property.  Rocla allegedly paid Starbrake $7,700,000 (inclusive of GST of $700,000) as either a royalty payment, payment for the grant of the licence, or as a prepayment for sand to be extracted from the land.22    On 17 October 2008 Starbrake lodged a Business Activity Statement (BAS) for the purposes of A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth) (GST Act).  The BAS was referrable to the period 1 July 2008 to 30 September 2008.  Starbrake did not declare, or otherwise bring to account in the BAS, the $700,000 portion of the payment received by it which represented the GST collected in relation to its supply of the licence (or extracted sand) to Rocla.23    In February 2012 Starbrake lodged its income tax return for the year ending 30 June 2009.  The income declared or disclosed in the return did not include the $7,000,000 payment (excluding GST) received from Rocla.24    The ATO conducted an audit of Starbrake.  In the course of that audit, the ATO ascertained that Starbrake’s general ledger recorded the $7,700,000 receipt by Starbrake as a loan from Mammoth Nominees Pty Ltd.  Mr Caratti was a director and sectary of Mammoth Nominees.  The registered office of Mammoth Nominees was Mr Caratti’s home address.  The ATO also obtained copies of emails sent to and received by Mr Joseph Catenacci, an accountant or tax agent who appears to have been retained by Starbrake.  Those emails suggested that the accounting classification of the $7,700,000 receipt by Starbrake was changed in about December 2011.  It was originally classified as income, however in December 2011 Mr Catenacci was allegedly instructed to classify the receipt as a loan from Mammoth Nominees.  25    The allegation being investigated was that Mr Caratti, as sole director of Starbrake, directed the reclassification of the receipt from Rocla so as to obtain a financial benefit.  That financial benefit was said to be the understatement of Starbrake’s income for the year ending 30 June 2009, as well as the non-remittance to the ATO of the GST collected by Starbrake (the GST portion of the payment) in relation to its supply to Rocla.  That remittance should have been included as part of the BAS for the quarter ending 30 September 2008.Third suspected offence (the Westend allegations)Text in the search warrant74    The third suspected offence was stated in the warrants as follows:In 2008 at Perth in Western Australia, Allen CARATTI by a deception, in that he falsified costs incurred by Westend Asset Pty Ltd, attempted to dishonestly obtain a financial advantage by not paying income tax, from another person, namely the Australian Taxation Office, which is a Commonwealth entity, contrary to Sections 11.1 and 134.2(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 [sic] (Cth).  Affidavit material for the third suspected offence75    The relevant parts of Federal Agent Szolnoki’s affidavit concerning the third suspected offence were as follows:6.47    In 2009, the ATO identified that between September 2003 and December 2008, WESTEND, a company controlled by A.CARATTI, had not reported significant sales of land in Darch, Western Australia that should have been reported as before tax profits.  The ATO commenced an audit and requested information from WESTEND in relation to the discovered land sales.  In response, WESTEND produced tax invoices from MAMMOTH for the development work on the land in Darch (known as the Ashdale Mews Estate) and reported that the works were undertaken on behalf of MAMMOTH by Mammoth Investments Pty Ltd.  The tax invoices totalled $5,400,000.6.48    ASIC records indicate that WESTEND was registered as an Australian proprietary company on 29 August 2003 and that its registered office is located at 21 Genevieve Court, Halls Head WA 6210.  Josephine BAZZO (J.BAZZO), the mother of BAZZO, is the office bearer of WESTEND and holds the following positions in the company: [Director and Secretary since 1 September 2003].6.49    Landgate records indicate that in 2002, WESTEND purchased several allotments of land in Darch to undertake a residential housing development.  This land was purchased for $7,600,000 through a loan agreement with Suncorp Bank.6.50    On 28 January 2010, the ATO conducted an interview with A.CARATTI in regards to WESTEND’s Ashdale Mews Estate development and the discovered land sales.  Also in attendance at this meeting was Hendricus (Hank) SCHOKKER (SCHOKKER) born 25 March 1950, a taxation consultant for A.CARATTI.  At the interview, A.CARATTI advised the ATO that he had full authority to represent J.BAZZO and to deal with matters pertaining to WESTEND.6.51    During this interview, A.CARATTI and SCHOKKER informed the ATO that most of the works relating to the Ashdale Mews Estate development at this location were done by Mammoth Investments, as per invoices previously provided to the ATO in 2009 at the commencement of the audit.6.52    The development works undertaken on the Ashdale Mews Estate was supervised by Ewings, an external civil engineering company.  Ewings’ role was to ensure that work was satisfactorily completed and also issue payment certificates to WESTEND.6.53    The ATO’s discussions with Ewings revealed that in 2004, WESTEND awarded Mammoth Investments a contract to provide subdivision works on the Ashdale Mews Estate.  Ewings also informed the ATO that, subsequent to this initial development work by Mammoth Investments, an external company Works Infrastructure Pty Ltd (Works Infrastructure) was engaged to complete site works to the value of $1,978,000.6.54    As a result of audit activity with WESTEND and Ewings, the ATO have estimated that the total of all initial site works (Mammoth Investments, Works Infrastructure and other subcontractors) was approximately $2,400,000, with the total cost of the initial bulk earthworks by Mammoth Investments on the site being to the value of only $213,642; significantly under the value of invoices produced by WESTEND.6.55    Analysis of WESTEND’s financial reporting by ATO revealed that the $213,642 of bulk earthworks conducted by Mammoth Investments was invoiced multiple times on different versions of the same tax invoice naming MAMMOTH or Mammoth Investments as the entity performing the work.  These invoices formed part of the $5,400,000 expenses claimed by WESTEND.6.56    Further to this, analysis of financial reports by the ATO revealed that WESTEND did not make payments totalling $5,400,000.00 for work conducted by Mammoth Investments, with the invoices from Mammoth Investments treated as a loan expense by WESTEND.  No loan repayments from WESTEND to Mammoth Investments have been evidenced to date.6.57    ASIC records identify that J.CARATTI is a current office bearer of Mammoth Investments [director]…  Other Directors of Mammoth Investments include M.CARATTI (since 12 December 1997), Aaron CARATTI (since 14 May 2002) and Nicole CARATTI (since 14 May 2002).  A.CARATTI held the position of Director of this company between 14 May 2002 and 09 October 2012.6.58    In an interview between the ATO and J.CARATTI, he stated that the invoices totalling $5,400,000.00 from Mammoth Investments for the work conducted on the Ashdale Mews Estate for WESTEND were false and that A.CARATTI had created them.6.59    ATO analysis of MYOB transactions, provided to the ATO by A.CARATTI and SCHOKKER during their interviews, reveals that the $5,400,000.00 of development expenses invoiced from Mammoth Investments were created in MYOB on 15 June 2009 – after the ATO audit had  begun.6.60    The applicant suspects that A.CARATTI falsified $5,400,000 worth of invoices from Mammoth Investments, for development works already undertaken by Works Infrastructure, for the purpose of inflating expenses for the benefit of WESTEND to avoid his taxation responsibilities.  76    Thus the allegation under investigation, spelt out in some detail, was that invoices created by Mr Caratti totalling $5.4 million were false, with the true cost of work done being closer to half that sum.  The full amount of the invoices totalling $5.4 million were suspected of having been treated as an expense to reduce the tax payable on the profits of Westend Asset Pty Ltd from unreported land sales.  The suspected offence focused on the creation of the alleged false invoices, alleged to have taken place in 2008, rather than upon the point at which documents were lodged with the ATO.  As the primary judge explained:The Westend allegations 26    The second group of allegations concerned a company called Westend Asset Pty Ltd.  The sole director of Westend was Ms Bazzo’s mother, Ms Josephine Bazzo.  Beyond that somewhat indirect connection, there was apparently no evidence to suggest that Mr Caratti had any direct or indirect interest in Westend.  Despite this, it appears that the AFP alleged that Westend was controlled by Mr Caratti.   27    In 2002, Westend purchased land in Darch, Western Australia, for the purposes of undertaking a residential housing development.  It would appear that the land cost somewhere in the order of $7,600,000.  The residential development became known as the Ashdale Mews Estate development.  The development apparently proceeded and in due course Westend sold the developed parcels of land.  Those sales were said to have occurred between September 2003 and December 2008. 28    The ATO commenced an audit of Westend in 2009.  In the course of that audit it was ascertained that Westend had not reported or declared the land sales as part of its business operations for tax purposes.  It had not declared any before tax profits made from its sales of the developed land.  29    In the course of the audit, Westend provided the ATO with copies of tax invoices from Mammoth Nominees addressed to Westend for work supposedly carried out in relation to the development.  Those tax invoices totalled $5,400,000.  Presumably the invoices were provided for the purpose of demonstrating that the expenses reflected in the invoices reduced any pre-tax profit made by Westend from the development.30    During an interview conducted by the ATO in January 2010, Mr Caratti and his tax agent, Mr Hendricus Schokker, told the ATO that the development work reflected in the invoices was in fact carried out by a company called Mammoth Investments Pty Ltd, supposedly on behalf of Mammoth Nominees.  Mr Caratti and various members of his family were directors of Mammoth Investments.31    The allegation being investigated as part of operation Caballus was that the invoices totalling $5,400,000 were false.  An analysis conducted by the ATO from financial records and other information revealed that the cost of any work carried out by Mammoth Investments totalled just over $2,000,000; that Westend never paid Mammoth Investments (or Mammoth Nominees) $5,400,000 in respect of any works, but that the invoices were nevertheless treated as a loan expense; and that the invoices were created in June 2009, after the ATO’s audit had commenced.  Mr Caratti’s brother, Mr John Caratti, told the ATO in the course of an interview that the invoices were false and were created by Mr Caratti.  32    It was alleged, in short, that Mr Caratti created the false invoices to inflate Westend’s expenses in relation to the development and therefore reduce any tax liability in respect of profits earned by Westend from the development.Fourth suspected offence (the Whitby Land Company allegations)Text in the search warrant77    The fourth suspected offence was stated in the warrants as follows:Between 1 July 2010 and 31 December 2013 at Perth in Western Australia, Allen CARATTI by a deception, in that he caused the Whitby Land Company Pty Ltd to withhold Goods and Services Tax, dishonestly obtained a financial advantage from another person, namely the Australian Taxation Office, which is a Commonwealth entity, contrary to Section 134.2(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 [sic] (Cth).Affidavit material for the fourth suspected offence78    The relevant parts of Federal Agent Szolnoki’s affidavit concerning the fourth suspected offence were as follows:6.76    ASIC records indicate that WHITBY was registered as an Australian proprietary company on 11 July 2005 and that its registered office is located at 2 Duncraig Road, Applecross, WA 6153.6.77    ASIC records identify that A.CARATTI is a current office bearer of Whitby…6.78    Other directors of WHITBY include Liang LI (LI) (since 14 March 2011) and Christina CARATTI (C.CARATTI) (since 01 January 2013), A.CARATTI’s daughter.6.79    Landgate records indicate that in January 2008, WHITBY acquired land identified as Lot 22 on Diagram 4515, certificate of volume 1353 and folio 245, located at 293 Nicholson Road, Forrestdale, WA 6112.…6.83    In 2012, an ATO audit of WHITBY, obtaining financial and business records, revealed the land at Lot 22, Nicholson Road, Forrestdale, is being developed and subdivided into residential lots.  Financial records analysed by the ATO have revealed that between 2011 and 2012, WHITBY sold 113 residential lots as part of this development, resulting in approximately $23,766,818 in sales.  The ATO has deemed this as assessable income.6.84    The ATO have advised the AFP that WHITBY did not register with the ATO for a Tax File Number (TFN), Australian Business Number (ABN) or GST when it was registered as a company in 2005.  WHITBY remained unregistered for taxation purposes until the ATO registered it for a TFN on 6 October 2012 and an ABN and GST on 3 November 2012.  The applicant suspects that by failing to register WHITBY for tax purposes, A.CARATTI was attempting to conceal potential income and avoid his taxation responsibilities.6.85    On 24 March 2010, Wilson and Atkinson Law Firm oversaw the production of documents produced by A.CARATTI to ATO auditors.  Within these documents was a deed of trust in relation to WHITBY.  It was executed as a deed and signed by A.CARATTI on 15 November 2007.  MAMMOTH of 2 Duncraig Rd, Applecross was listed as the beneficiary in relation to the property described as Lot 22, 293, Nicholson Rd, Forestdale.  This document was witness by SCHOKKER.6.86    The ATO estimate that for the 2011 and 2012 taxation years, the land development undertaken by WHITBY has resulted in net taxable income of approximately $8,161,390.  The ATO assessed a GST liability of approximately $1,425,497.6.87    The ATO have advised that even though WHITBY has not advised sales of land or declared income in relation to its development for the 2012 financial year, MAMMOTH submitted claims to the ATO for income tax deductions in that year with respect to the development of land being undertaken by WHITBY at 293 Nicholson Road, Forrestdale, WA.6.88    ATO analysis of documents obtained from WHITBY accountants, Macri Partners (MACRI) with regard to MAMMOTH’s claim for income tax deductions identify that MAMMOTH are claiming approximately $50,000,000 attributable to the development of the Nicholson Road land.6.89    About 27 to 29 November 2012, WHITBY lodged BAS statements to the ATO covering 2011/12 financial year for WHITBY through their accountants MACRI.  These statements were rejected as the ATO was in the process of issuing assessments with respect to WHITBY’s taxation liability.  The applicant suspects that the BAS statements were only lodged in response to ATO audit activity in an attempt to a taxation debt.…79    The allegation under investigation was therefore that Whitby Land Company Pty Ltd, at Mr Caratti’s instigation, sold land worth almost $24 million, but that the goods and services tax (GST) due on that sum of about $1.5 million was never reported or remitted as required.  The allegation is that Mr Caratti deliberately and dishonestly brought that about in the period between the middle of 2010 and the end of 2013.  As the primary judge explained:Whitby Land Company allegations 33    The third group of allegations concerned a company called Whitby Land Company Pty Ltd.  Mr Caratti was a director of Whitby Land Company.  34    In January 2008, Whitby Land Company acquired land at 293 Nicholson Road, Forrestdale, Western Australia.  It would appear that Whitby Land Company subdivided and developed the Nicholson Road land into residential lots.  The lots were subsequently sold for a total amount of about $24,000,000.  Those sales appear to have occurred during 2011 and 2012.  35    Despite its involvement in the enterprise responsible for the development and sale of the Nicholson Road land, Whitby Land Company was never registered under the GST Act.  It follows that it never reported or remitted any GST payable and collected by it in respect of its supply of the developed lots.  The ATO assessed Whitby Land Company’s GST liability as being in the order of $1.5 million. 36    The allegation being investigated was that Mr Caratti, as a director of Whitby Land Company, deliberately failed to register Whitby Land Company for GST and deliberately failed to remit the GST portion of the consideration it received from the land sales.  Fifth suspected offence (the Gucce Holdings allegations)Text in the search warrant80    The fifth suspected offence was stated in the warrants as follows:In December 2011 at Perth in Western Australia, Allen CARATTI and Tina BAZZO, by a deception, in that they falsified costs incurred by Gucce Holdings Pty Ltd, attempted to dishonestly obtain a financial advantage by overstating Goods and Services Tax input credits, from another person, namely the Australian Taxation Office, which is a Commonwealth entity, contrary to Sections 11.1 and 134.2(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 [sic] (Cth).Affidavit material in relation to the fifth suspected offence81    The relevant parts of Federal Agent Szolnoki’s affidavit concerning the fifth suspected offence were as follows:6.110    ASIC records indicate that FOREST HOPE was registered as an Australian proprietary company on 31 October 2006 and that its principal place of business is 48 Wickham Street, East Perth, WA 6004.6.111    ASIC records identify that BAZZO is the current director of the company, appointed 27 July 2011, recorded against 2 Duncraig Road, Applecross, WA 6153.  A.CARATTI has also been an office holder of FOREST HOPE holding the following position: [Director: 31/10/2006 – 27/07/2011]6.112    ASIC records indicate that Gucce Holdings Pty Ltd (GUCCE) was registered as an Australian proprietary company on 7 January 2002 and that its registered office is 48 Wickham Street, East Perth, WA 6004…6.113    ASIC records indicate that BAZZO is the current sole director and secretary of GUCCE.  BAZZO is recorded against 2 Duncraig Road, Applecross, WA 6153.  A.CARATTI is recorded as a previous director of GUCCE, between the dates 17 January 2002 and 01 February 2002, A.CARATTI is recorded against 517 Great Eastern Highway, Redcliffe, WA 6104.6.114    In December 2009, a Joint Venture (JV) agreement between GUCCE and FOREST HOPE.  The joint venture was a land subdivision of Lot 9029 Broadway, Aveley, WA 6069 (known as Aveley Green), of which GUCCE owned a fifty percent share.6.115    Between 28 July 2011 and 16 November 2012, works were undertaken as per the terms of the JV.  As part of the works, civil and earth works were undertaken in the process of subdividing the land.  MAMMOTH were hired by GUCCE to complete these works.  During the process of the subdivision, MAMMOTH issued 40 invoices to GUCCE and FORREST HOPE for the works completed, as per the terms of the JV.6.116    The 40 invoices, contained invoice numbers, total cost including GST, works completed and what stage of the project the invoice related to.  Each invoice was signed by an independent site supervisor, who confirmed the costs charged for each invoice.6.117    The total cost for works completed, as signed on the 40 invoices by the independent site supervisor was $15,040,672.14, including GST of $1,367,344.6.118    Between 17 August 2011 and 31 December 2012, GUCCE paid $14,153,499.33 for the works undertaken by MAMMOTH.6.119    In May 2013, the ATO commenced an audit of GUCCE after it was identified that GUCCE had incorrectly reported income to the ATO.6.120    As a result of the ATO audit, it was identified that GUCCE, in relation to the JV, had claimed GST input credits totalling $2,218,953.22.  To support this claim, GUCCE provided the ATO with stage by stage reconciliation of initial costs, per developed lot, completed through SLS Accounting.  This included invoices for works undertaken by MAMMOTH, relating to the JV, totalling $22,847,181.25.6.121    ATO analysis of the cost breakdown schedules and [redacted citing public interest immunity] that the transaction amounts are higher than the certified work, including higher contract prices, added work items and higher unit prices.6.122    As works totalling $15,040,672.14 had been verified by the independent site supervisor, the applicant suspects that BAZZO and A.CARATTI on behalf of GUCCE and MAMMOTH, have colluded to create false invoices for the works undertaken, in order to claim GST input credits and reduce taxable income, resulting in GUCCE / MAMMOTH obtaining a financial advantage.  The income reported by MAMMOTH to the ATO, did not match the expenses listed by GUCCE.6.123    The applicant suspects that GUCCE deliberately overstated GST credits in relation to FOREST HOPE, by forming an agreement with MAMMOTH, which resulted in the creation of invoices, in order to dishonestly obtain a benefit from the ATO.6.124    Inquiries with ASIC reveal that MAMMOTH is registered at 2 Duncraig Road, Applecross WA 6153 with Allen Bruce CARATTI as Director and Secretary, A.CARATTI is recorded against 517 Great Eastern Highway WA 6104.…82    The allegation under investigation is that the claiming of input tax credits was brought about by Mr Caratti and supported by Ms Bazzo by the provision of false invoices, with the focus being on when the false documents were alleged to have been created.  As the primary judge explained:The Gucce Holdings allegations 37    The fourth group of allegations concerned two companies:  Gucce Holdings Pty Ltd and Forest Hope Pty Ltd.  Ms Bazzo was a director of both companies.  Mr Caratti had been a director of Gucce Holdings, though at a time well before the events the subject of the relevant allegations.  He was a director of Forest Hope up to a time just before the most significant events the subject of the investigation.38    In December 2009, Gucce Holdings and Forrest Hope entered into a joint venture agreement in relation to the subdivision of land in Avery, Western Australia.  Gucce had a 50% interest in that land. 39    Gucce Holdings retained Mammoth Nominees to do civil and earth works in relation to the subdivision.  Mammoth Nominees issued forty invoices to Gucce Holdings and Forest Hope in relation to the works.  The invoices totalled $15,040,672.14, including GST of $1,367,344.  Each of the invoices was signed-off by an independent site supervisor.  Between August 2011 and December 2012, Gucce Holdings paid $14,153,499.33 to Mammoth in respect of the work.40    In May 2013, the ATO commenced an audit of Gucce Holdings.  During the audit it was ascertained that Gucce Holdings had claimed input tax credits under the GST Act in respect of the works carried out by Mammoth Nominees.  The input tax credits claimed by Gucce Holdings totalled $2,218,953.22.  In simple terms, the amount of the input tax credits to which Gucce Holdings was legitimately entitled to claim equalled the amount of the GST it paid in respect of Mammoth Nominee’s supplies: see s 11-25 and s 17-5 of the GST Act.  It appeared that Gucce Holdings had claimed more input tax credits than it was legitimately able to claim.41    In the course of the audit, Gucce Holdings endeavoured to support its entitlement to claim input tax credits referable to the supplies by Mammoth Nominees by providing detailed information, including invoices, suggesting that Gucce had in fact paid $22,847,181 to Mammoth Nominees for the works.  That was a considerably larger amount than the amount reflected in the 40 invoices signed off by the independent site supervisor. 42    The allegation being investigated was that Mr Caratti and Ms Bazzo colluded to overstate the input tax credits which Gucce was entitled to claim and created false invoices to substantiate that claim.  The execution of the search warrants83    The execution of the search warrants was carried out over three days between 28 and 30 January 2015, resulting in the seizure of a large number of documents and other items, mainly computers and electronic storage devices.  Several features of the process of execution, as recorded in the primary judge’s findings, should be noted: (1)    Prior to the execution of the search warrants, it was decided by Federal Agent Nicholson that it would be beneficial to have the assistance of tax officers with some background knowledge of the business and tax affairs of Mr Caratti and Ms Bazzo.(2)    On 22 January 2015, Federal Agent Nicholson distributed a draft Standard Tactical Plan to Federal Agents who were rostered to participate in the execution of the search warrants.  That document included background information concerning Mr Caratti and Ms Bazzo and details of the offences in terms relevantly identical to the terms of the third condition of the warrants.(3)    On 27 January 2015, Federal Agent Nicholson delivered a briefing to the Federal Agents and tax officers who were expected to be involved in the execution of the warrants.  (4)    Prior to execution, some “premises-specific” briefings were also conducted by certain “Team Leaders”, although it appears that this involved little more than the team leaders reading out the third condition offences.(5)    A large number of tax officers ultimately assisted in the execution of the warrants, acting as “constables assisting” for the purposes of Part IAA of the Crimes Act.  (6)    Tax officers – Mr Peter Irvin and Ms Amanda Milner – assisted in the execution of the warrants at the premises at Wickham Street, East Perth.  Mr Irvin’s involvement with the execution at those premises relevantly included distributing to at least some of the officers assisting a document intended to aid searches by informing them of some of the background to the allegations that were the subject of the warrant (Search Relevances document).Grounds of appeal84    The first and second grounds of appeal renew the attack on the offence descriptions in the third condition of the search warrants, both as to validity on their face, and as to whether such a condition, so expressed, was authorised by the material before the issuing magistrate.  The third ground attacks the primary judge’s finding as to severability of any of the offences in the third condition.  The fourth ground renews the attack on the execution of the search warrants in particular respects.  The fifth ground attacks the primary judge’s solution to the problem with electronic devices being unlawfully seized, which was effectively to allow the Commissioner to do what would have been permitted and should have been done in the first place under the statutory regime for copying and examining data stored on a computer.85    Given the close connection between the first and second grounds of appeal, concerning different aspects of the offence description in the third condition, it is convenient to set out the competing arguments for both, but to address them in combination.  First and second appeal grounds – the offence descriptions:•    The search warrants were invalid on their face by reason of the offence descriptions (ground 1; whole of ground 1B below)•    The issue of the search warrants was invalid by reason that the offence descriptions were broader than justified by the information before the issuing officer (ground 2; whole of ground 1A below)First and second appeal grounds as pleaded 86    Mr Caratti’s first ground of appeal is stated as follows:  His Honour erred in finding that the Warrants were valid on their face, in finding that they sufficiently specified the perimeters within which materials were able to be searched for and seized and that they were capable of sufficiently informing the occupiers of the relevant premises of the authorised area of the search and seizure: [162], [238], [483].Particulars as to [alleged erroneous] conclusions on each offence in the Third Condition of the Warrants(i)    The description of the first offence in the Third Condition, which related to Starbrake Pty Limited, was sufficient to enable an occupier to discern a search perimeter relevant to the offence: [133].(ii)    When read in conjunction with the first offence, it would have been tolerably clear to the reader of the second offence in the Third Condition that the alleged GST liability in the description of that offence related to the royalty income received Starbrake Pty Limited, and that the dishonesty arose from the alleged reclassification of that income.  The gist or substance of the key factual allegations that underlay the second offence were sufficiently apparent to identify the object or area of the search: [139]-[140], [145].(iii)    The third offence, which related to Westend Asset Pty Limited, was particularised such that the gist or substance of the key factual allegations that underlay the offence were sufficiently apparent to identify the object or area of the search: [145].(iv)    The description of the fourth offence related to Whitby Land Company Pty Limited was sufficient to satisfy the requirement that it define or provide a meaningful or intelligible search perimeter: [152].(v)    On balance there is sufficient particularity and clarity in the description of the fifth offence in the Third Condition, related to Gucce Holdings Pty Limited, to indicate the area of search permitted by the warrants: [159].87    Mr Caratti’s second ground of appeal is stated as follows:His Honour erred in finding that the search perimeter permitted by the Warrants did not exceed what was reasonably justified by the material before the issuing officer: [175], [189]-[193], [199], [238], [482]. Findings of the primary judge relevant to the first and second appeal grounds (offence descriptions)88    In relation to ground 1B below, which is revisited as the first ground of appeal, the primary judge considered that the description of each of the suspected offences in the third condition of the warrants was sufficient to define adequately the area of search.  This conclusion was reached notwithstanding a number of issues his Honour identified with the drafting of the descriptions.  In particular, those descriptions were considered to be “ambiguous or unclear” in places and showed a very poor appreciation of the terms of the underlying tax legislation, demonstrated by repeated erroneous reference to the Australian Taxation Office as the relevant legal entity, ambiguity in the particularisation of the date on which some of the alleged conduct was said to have occurred, and the description of several offences in terms of “withholding” or failing to pass on GST, the meaning of which was not readily clear or consistent with any concept in the GST legislation.89    Despite these and other concerns about the drafting of the warrants, his Honour concluded that the suspected offences were sufficiently disclosed to avoid invalidity.  His Honour emphasised that the Court’s role was to approach the descriptions broadly and without overzealous technicality, and to consider the descriptions fairly and in the context of each warrant as a whole.  In respect of each suspected offence, his Honour placed weight on the fact that the descriptions included the name or names of the persons accused of the offences, the relevant offence provision, some temporal particularisation, and the general “gist” of the offending conduct.  In other words, the focus was on the substantive conduct being investigated, even if it did not conform accurately or precisely to the legal incidence or effect of what was said to have occurred.90    Because the paragraphs cited in the second appeal ground make clear why this particular aspect of review ground 1B before the primary judge failed, and because the appeal in this respect turns on the conclusions his Honour reached, it is necessary to examine the text of each paragraph of his Honour’s reasons.  For each, Mr Caratti must show not merely that a different conclusion was open, but that the conclusion reached was wrong and therefore not available to his Honour.  91    The particular paragraphs of the primary judge’s reasons complained of in the second ground of appeal do not need to be reproduced, but can be summarised as follows:(1)    At [175], his Honour rejected Mr Caratti’s characterisation of the offences in the third condition as “discrete transactions” as being neither fair nor accurate, describing them instead as four allegations involving relatively complex facts and conduct extending over a period of time – his Honour therefore concluded that there was no need to limit the issue of warrants to discrete transactions.  (2)    At [189]-[190], his Honour considered the first two “Starbrake” offences in the third condition and concluded that, while a technical approach might lead to a conclusion that the focus on 2008 was erroneous and that different dates might have been fixed upon, that date was when the conduct giving rise to the alleged fraud took place.  Accordingly, at least some of the factual or legal elements of each offence took place in 2008 and there was no error in focussing on that date, even if other dates might have been used because aspects of the fraud alleged took place later in time.(3)    At [191]-[193], his Honour considered the third “Westend” offence in the third condition, and similarly concluded that while dates other than 2008 might have been relied upon, again at least part of that offence was referrable to that year.(4)    At [199], his Honour made the point that while the offences in the third condition could have been drafted in narrower terms or with different dates or date ranges, and that the words and dates used lacked clarity and particularity, the information before the issuing officer was capable of satisfying the criteria for the issue of the search warrants.(5)    At [238], as relevant to this appeal ground, his Honour summarised an aspect of the conclusions reached to the effect that the search warrants were not invalid on the basis that it was not open to the issuing officer to be satisfied that there were reasonable grounds to suspect that evidential material referrable to the third condition would be at the premises.(6)    At [482], as relevant to this appeal ground, his Honour again stated the conclusion that the information before the issuing officer was sufficient to support a finding that there were reasonable grounds for suspecting that there was, at the relevant premises, things with respect to which there were reasonable grounds for suspecting they would afford evidence of the commission of the offences in the third condition, and that Mr Caratti had not proved otherwise.  Subject to a severance finding as to a paragraph making an invalid reference to seizure of “any storage medium”, the search permitted did not exceed what was justified by the material before the issuing officer.92    In relation to ground 1A below, which is revisited as the second ground of appeal, the primary judge rejected the contention made by Mr Caratti that the search area identified by the warrants was broader than what was reasonably justified by the material before the issuing officer.  In advancing that argument, Mr Caratti placed considerable reliance on the obiter dicta of Fox J in R v Tillett; Ex parte Newton (1969) 14 FLR 101 at 125, where his Honour, having concluded that the relevant search warrants were invalid by reason of certain defects, proceeded to make the following observations: As to the area of the search, I believe that the requirements are flexible.  If, as is now likely to be the case, the issue of the warrant rests on statutory authority, the content of the warrant is governed by the statute and must not only comply with the more specific requirements thereof, but it should not be wider than is necessary to carry out the manifest legislative purpose.  In a case under s 10(b), for example, it would be wrong to issue a warrant which authorized a general search of bank premises, when the information pointed to one forged cheque.  Even a search for all documents relating to a particular account may be too wide.  There should be no limitation on an adequate search, but it is a function of the information to show how wide that search may have to be, and the function of the justice to ensure that his warrant does not authorize anything wider.  Each case must depend upon its own facts.93    The primary judge did not accept that Fox J was intending to lay down a rigid test concerning the permitted area of search and seizure of a warrant.  His Honour stated:171    It should be noted that the search warrant in question in Tillett purported to permit the search of bank premises and the seizure of “books, papers, documents or other things” as to which there were “reasonable grounds for believing that the same will afford evidence of the commission of an offence against the Commonwealth Crimes Act”.  No specific offence was specified.  There was effectively no limitation on the books, papers, documents and things that could be searched for and seized.  It is not surprising, in those circumstances, that the warrant was found to be defective.  The observations of Fox J should be considered in that context. 172    It is readily apparent that Fox J was not intending to lay down any rigid test concerning the issue of search warrants or the permitted area of search and seizure.  As his Honour said, the “requirements are flexible”, the “content of the warrant is governed by the statute” in question and that “each case must be governed by its own facts”.  His Honour’s reference to the warrant not being “wider than necessary”, and the issuing officer’s function being to ensure that the warrant does not authorise “anything wider”, must be read as meaning anything wider than permitted under the relevant statutory provision, properly construed.  Contrary to Mr Caratti’s submission, Tillet is not authority for the much broader proposition that the offence specified in a search warrant must be particularised in the narrowest possible terms supported by the information before the issuing officer.94    His Honour considered that the relevant question was whether the information before the issuing officer was capable of satisfying the officer, in simplified terms, that there were reasonable grounds to suspect that there were things at the premises that would afford evidence of the commission of the offences specified in the warrants.  It was accepted that, as considered in George v Rockett at 117, the more broadly a warrant describes the kinds of evidential material to be searched for, the more difficult it might be for the information before the issuing officer to satisfy this requirement.  However, his Honour held that it would not be impermissible to describe the object of the search in a broad, non-specific fashion, citing Dunesky v Elder at 555E-F.Appellant’s submissions on the first and second appeal grounds (offence descriptions)95    The central contention advanced by Mr Caratti on his first ground of appeal was that the descriptions of the suspected offences in the warrants give rise to “intolerable ambiguity” because they are capable of two different meanings and of defining two different search areas.  Accordingly, it was submitted that the primary judge erred in concluding that the statement of the offences was sufficient to meet the requirement expressed in Zhang v Commissioner, Australian Federal Police [2009] FCA 1170; 260 ALR 580; 111 ALD 123; 77 ATR 713 at [13] that the descriptions provide “real and meaningful perimeters to the ‘area of search’”.  That view was in part drawn from Beneficial Finance at 543.  In the present case, it was submitted that the use of the “three-condition” search warrant as a drafting device gave rise to a greater need for particularisation, having regard to the broadly drafted first and second conditions of the search warrant.96    In support of the contention that the warrants gave rise to “intolerable” ambiguity, counsel drew a distinction between language that is “infelicitous” or “inelegant” and language that is “unintelligible” or “ambiguous”.  Ambiguity, it was submitted, would render a warrant invalid, citing the statement in Ousley v The Queen (1997) 192 CLR 69 at 107 that a warrant will be “bad” if it is “so vaguely worded that a person affected by it cannot know the object of the search”.  Reliance was also placed on Williams v Keelty [2001] FCA 1301; 111 FCR 175 at [156], Parker v Churchill (in the Full Court) at 340.8 and Corbett at [106]. 97    In oral submissions, counsel for Mr Caratti addressed the principle espoused by Burchett J in Beneficial Finance that a legally incorrect formulation in a search warrant will not necessarily invalidate the warrant.  It was submitted that this principle is qualified by a requirement that the warrant be plainly comprehensible, as expressed at 543, where his Honour stated (emphasis added):… If the courts were to insist upon the invalidation of a warrant for a legally incorrect formulation of an offence, although the substance of the offence could plainly be understood, they would not be interpreting the will of the Parliament but subverting it.98    The main species of ambiguity said to affect the search area of the warrants in the present case arises primarily from the imprecision of the time periods specified for some of the suspected offences.  In this regard, the force of the appellant’s submissions was directed towards the first and second offences, which were described in the warrants as having occurred “in 2008” and concern Mr Caratti’s suspected reclassification of royalty income as a loan to avoid paying income tax and the suspected failure of his company Starbrake “to pass on” GST.  The relevant asserted ambiguity, as identified by the primary judge, is said to arise in the following manner:  (1)    In relation to the first offence, it is unclear whether the particularised date of 2008 refers to the date on which the alleged deceptive conduct occurred (either the accounting reclassification of the royalty payment, or perhaps the lodging of a false tax return that did not declare the royalty income), or the date on which the financial advantage was allegedly obtained.  That date would be the date on which the tax would, but for the deception, have been assessed as payable.  (2)    In relation to the second offence, the description of the contravening conduct as a failure to “pass on” GST gives rise to similar difficulties in ascertaining what conduct is in fact being referred to, noting that the GST legislation does not refer to GST being “collected”, nor does it create or refer to an obligation to “pass on” GST.  On appeal, Mr Caratti submits that this imprecision means that there are multiple interpretations possible as to what the time period “in 2008” refers to.  99    Counsel for Mr Caratti directed the Court to the primary judge’s reasons at [131], where, having identified the relevant ambiguities, his Honour emphasised that:… the question of the sufficiency of the description of the offences in the warrant is not to be approached as if the warrant was an indictment and the issue was the legal sufficiency of the pleading.  The exercise involved in determining whether the description of the offences in a search warrant is sufficient is not to be approached as if it was a demurrer.  Nor is it a counsel of perfection.  Rather, as already indicated, the question is whether, viewed broadly and not perversely or with undue technicality, the general nature of the offences is sufficiently disclosed so as to indicate the authorised area of search.100    The vice said to be disclosed in the approach adopted above is that the primary judge was said to have committed an error of principle in dealing with the issue as a question of the sufficiency of the particulars supplied, instead of grappling with the proper question of whether the descriptions were impermissibly ambiguous.  In oral submissions, counsel for Mr Caratti submitted that the test of “adequacy” involves two parts: first, whether there is sufficiency of particularity; and second, whether the warrant is free from ambiguity, in the sense of the warrant having two meanings.  Accordingly, it is said that although the primary judge identified ambiguity in the warrants, his Honour failed to recognise that such ambiguity might “intolerably” give rise to two different meanings and two different areas of search.  Further error is also said to have been disclosed by the primary judge in finding that a reader of the warrants would perceive a connection between the first and second offences.  101    Reliance was also placed on asserted ambiguities in the balance of the offences as follows:(1)    In relation to the third offence concerning a suspected failure by Westend Asset Pty Ltd to pay income tax, it was asserted that the primary judge erred in concluding that the gist or substance of the key factual allegations that underlay the offence was sufficiently clear, in circumstances where his Honour considered that, if the offence were an indictment, the prosecution would be required to clarify exactly what was alleged to have occurred in 2008: whether it was the falsification of the costs, or the lodgement of the relevant income tax return, or whether 2008 simply referred to the relevant income. (2)    In relation to the fourth offence concerning a suspected “withholding” of GST by Whitby Land Company Pty Ltd, it is asserted that intolerable ambiguity arises because it is unclear what is meant by “withholding” GST, an expression which does not readily accord with any concept in the GST legislation.  It was further submitted that this formulation gives rise to temporal ambiguity, in that it is not clear whether the period “between 1 July 2010 and 31 December 2013” refers to, for example, the period of failure to register GST, GST tax periods, or the dates when the BAS were due to be lodged and net amounts due to be paid.(3)    In relation to the fifth offence concerning an alleged overstatement of GST input credits by Gucce Holdings Pty Ltd “in December 2011”, it is asserted that the description is ambiguous as to what occurred in that time period.  For example, the offence might refer to when it was agreed that costs be falsified, the actual falsification of costs, the GST tax period to which the falsified costs relate, the date when BAS were due to be lodged and net amounts due to be paid, or the date when BAS were in fact lodged.102    In his second ground of appeal, Mr Caratti also asserted error in the primary judge’s conclusion that the search area permitted by the warrants did not exceed what was reasonably justified by the material before the issuing officer.  In support of that assertion, it was said that, applying the reasoning in George v Rockett at 116.4 – 119.2 to the statutory language of the Crimes Act, a warrant is “unjustifiably wide” if, in respect of the evidential material to be searched for, the supporting affidavit material did not provide reasonable grounds for suspecting that the material would be at the relevant premises nor reasonable grounds for suspecting that the material would afford evidence as to the commission of the offence.  It was noted that the statutory language of “will afford” in s 3E of the Crimes Act echoes the provisions that were considered in George v Rockett.  In this regard, it was emphasised that the more broadly a warrant describes the kinds of evidential material to be searched for, the more difficult it might be to meet this requirement.  103    It was suggested that a search area might be broader than justified by the material before the issuing officer in two circumstances.  First, where the offence defines a search perimeter that is different from what was intended or supported; and secondly, where the lack of particularity in the language of the offence results in a failure to confine the search area to what was justified. 104    The area covered by the search warrants in the present case was (again) said to be broader than justified by the affidavit material before the issuing officer as follows: (1)    The first suspected offence should not have referred to 2008 as the date of reclassification of royalty income, in circumstances where the material before the issuing officer justified a charge founded on that reclassification occurring in late 2011 or early 2012, albeit in respect of tax liability arising in 2008.  Moreover, the material before the issuing officer suggested that the offence constituted a single, discrete royalty transaction, while the offence description did not refer to or confine itself to any transaction.  (2)    The second suspected offence similarly did not refer and was not confined to the royalty transaction that was the subject of the affidavit material.  Likewise, the date of the offence should not have been stated as the calendar year “2008” in circumstances where the affidavit material (which suggested a failure to report income at the end of the relevant financial year) did not support an offence occurring prior to 1 July 2008.(3)    The third suspected offence should not have referred, without proper confinement, to “withholding” GST, in circumstances where the subject of the affidavit material was a single transaction, being the falsification of costs from Mammoth Pty Ltd totalling $5.4 million.  Accordingly, it was said that the primary judge erred at [179] in concluding that “the offence also involved other conduct and circumstances that provided necessary context and background to the alleged falsification of costs”.  (4)    The fourth suspected offence referred, without proper confinement, to “withholding” GST, in circumstances where the affidavit material suggested a contravention constituted by a single transaction, being the failure to register GST payable to the ATO.  Moreover, the offence was also broader than justified having regard to the deficiency in the particulars of the factual allegations, which did not provide, as noted by the primary judge at [153], “any, or any meaningful, particulars of how Whitby Land Company’s GST liability arose and why Mr Caratti’s withholding of amounts payable by Whitby Land Company was deceptive and dishonest”. (5)    The fifth suspected offence referred, without proper confinement, to “withholding” GST, in circumstances where the affidavit material concerned falsified costs that could be confined to a particular project and particular invoices. Respondent’s submissions on the first and second appeal grounds (offence descriptions)105    In relation to the first appeal ground, the Commissioner submitted that the statement of an offence in a warrant need not meet a high bar.  The required approach is instead “broad” and “practical”: Beneficial Finance at 538.  The approach “eschews overzealous technicality”: Beneficial Finance at 543.  The question is one of substance, even if the offence is given a legally incorrect formulation: Beneficial Finance at 533-535; Corbett at [1].  The true principle is that the warrant “should disclose the nature of the offence” sufficiently.106    The Commissioner made a number of submissions in turn about the sufficiency of the description of each offence in the warrants.  Generally, the Commissioner emphasised that the warrants were to be read as a whole and in a practical way.  It was said that language is inherently ambiguous, and the test for validity of a warrant is not and has never been that the offence relied upon is identified without any ambiguity.107    In respect of each offence, the Commissioner reiterated the primary judge’s findings that the warrants identified some temporal range, the person suspected of committing the offence, the relevant provisions said to have been contravened, and the “gist” or nature of the relevant course of conduct.  108    Specific submissions in respect of the description of each of the offences were advanced on behalf of the Commissioner as follows:(1)    In relation to the first and second suspected offences, it was submitted that it was not necessary for the warrants to specify with precision what was relied on as having occurred in 2008, as the matter was at an investigation stage and precisely what had occurred could not have been known.  It was further submitted that the warrants sufficiently directed searchers to look for material from, in, or around 2008 connected to the reclassification of royalty income paid to Starbrake Pty Ltd.(2)    In relation to the third suspected offence, it was emphasised that invalidity is especially unlikely to arise by reason of the ambiguities identified, where the subject matter of the offence is otherwise clearly identified, being the falsification of costs by a named entity and failure to pay tax.  (3)    In relation to the fourth and fifth suspected offences, it was submitted that any reasonable reader of the warrants would have understood the reference to “withholding” GST to refer to a failure to pay GST to the ATO.  No real ambiguity was said to arise from this natural reading.109    As to the second ground of appeal, the Commissioner submitted that the warrant affidavits provided a sufficient basis for the issuing officer to issue the warrants, setting out material from which it was open to conclude that there were reasonable grounds for the suspicion that Mr Caratti had engaged in the various contraventions.  It was further submitted that the primary judge asked the very question which the appellant says should have been asked, namely, whether the offences stated in the warrants were “broader than justified by the information”.  The reason why his Honour addressed ambiguities in the drafting of the warrants when considering this issue was because of the way Mr Caratti put his case.110    It was also submitted that Mr Caratti’s reliance on the words “will afford” used in George v Rockett is misplaced.  It was said that the issuing officer may only issue a warrant if there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that there is or will be “evidential material” at the premises, as the expression does not call for precise correspondence between evidential material that the issuing officer suspects will be at the relevant premises and the offence specified in the warrant.  111    The submissions for the Commissioner are correct as far as they go, but they do not properly grapple with the substance of the complaint being made, or with the solution to that complaint arrived at by the primary judge, or with the limited nature of appeals by way of rehearing, and the requirement for error to be established.  That is largely left to reliance on his Honour’s reasoning.Consideration of the first and second appeal grounds (offence descriptions)112    An immediate point to be made about the submissions made on behalf of Mr Caratti is that they amount to little more than pointing to the conclusions that the primary judge might have reached, but did not, if the focus in the drafting of the third condition had been clearer on the technical aspects of the offences as they would need to be proved and therefore might ultimately be charged.  That approach, in substance, although disavowed in form, of requiring search warrant offences to comply with the formal and exacting characteristics of criminal charges or indictments (here in the context of the law of taxation) has been repeatedly rejected as the authorities summarised above make clear.  113    This approach also did not properly grapple with the central part of his Honour’s reasoning, which was to look at the breadth of material before the issuing officer and to note that the conduct in question had a number of different facets stretching over a period of time, with the offence descriptions focusing more on an aspect of the conduct rather than its totality.  His Honour effectively concluded that it was open to have a search warrant that focused on a part of the period in which material conduct contributing to the commission of an offence was suspected to have taken place.  No error in that approach has been demonstrated.  That is particularly so when regard is had to the nature of the conduct under investigation, as spelt out in the affidavit used to obtain the search warrants, key parts of which are reproduced above.114    Neither the affidavit nor the search warrants, while not highly detailed, exact or precise in the manner of Mr Caratti’s complaint, were required to meet such an exacting standard.  Rather, they were to be read beneficially, and without overzealous technicality.  While greater clarity doubtless would have been better for all concerned, including this Court both at first instance and on appeal, it is important not to lose sight of the fact that the search warrants were in aid of a criminal investigation being conducted by police officers assisted by tax officers, not a curial process conducted by lawyers.  What was required was sufficient material giving rise to conjecture or surmise that material would be found that would afford evidence of the commission of each of the named offences, and that the suspected offences stated in the search warrants sufficiently identified what was being investigated to limit the ambit of the search and any seizure that might follow.  It is general warrants that must be avoided, not warrants that lack the precision of, for example, curial processes, either civil or criminal.115    The primary judge was correct to conclude that the necessary bar for validity had been met both as to the sufficiency of the material before the issuing officer and in the adequacy of the offence descriptions contained in the search warrants that were issued.  This was a difficult value judgment that was open for his Honour to make, especially as his Honour, at [246], correctly rejected the submission made on behalf of the Commissioner that s 3E created only a “low bar” for the issue of a valid search warrant.  116    The primary judge properly expressed concern at the poor quality of the drafting and the problems that had resulted, including the need for detailed consideration and analysis by his Honour of a kind that should not have been necessary.  His Honour did not lightly come to the conclusion that the search warrants were sufficiently supported by the material in the affidavit, nor to the conclusion that the offence descriptions in the search warrants were adequate, if not ideal.  Those conclusions were fairly open to his Honour.117    In particular, it was open to the primary judge to conclude that the offence descriptions sufficiently disclosed the substance and nature of the suspected offences, notwithstanding the lack of clarity arising by reason of reference to “withholding” or failing to pass on GST, expressions which were not consistent with any concept in the GST legislation.  Again, the submissions on behalf of Mr Caratti did not go further than suggesting that the primary judge did not reach the preferable conclusion.  Accordingly, no error on his Honour’s part has been identified.  It should be emphasised that, as was observed by the primary judge, the statement of the offence in a search warrant need not be made with the precision of an indictment.  The standard required is to be informed by the real object of the third condition of the warrants, namely, to identify the kind of offences alleged: Dunesky v Elder at 557C.  118    Similarly, the continued insistence on behalf of Mr Caratti that dates of the kind that might be found in a criminal charge or indictment were required misses the point of having an offence description which generally, but sufficiently, describes the conduct under investigation, so as to frame and confine the area of the search and any seizure.  None of the offence descriptions took the search inquiry beyond the conduct being investigated and the supporting affidavit material.  To the contrary, the focus was perhaps more on the time at which key aspects of the conduct took place than on the time of legal incidence of fraud to which the suspected offences related.  Viewed in this way, the offence descriptions were narrower in time than might validly have been used.  119    There could have been no complaint if the date range for each of the suspected offences had started from the earliest possible date and ended at the latest possible date, perhaps qualified by “about” to make it clear that, at the investigative stage at least, such precision was neither possible nor necessary.  It is worth observing in that regard that approximate dates or date ranges, rather than precise dates, are often used in criminal charges and indictments, although sometimes greater precision is possible and may be indispensable.  The search ambit cannot be said to have been misstated in any material way by being expressed in narrower terms by date than it had to be, leaving any wider material found to be potentially seized by the exercise of the power bestowed by s 3F(1)(d)(i).  For the same reason, the area of search defined by the search warrants cannot be said to be any broader than was justified by the supporting affidavit material.120    In Dunesky v Elder, the Full Court relevantly considered on appeal a challenge to the validity of search warrants on the basis that certain particulars in the offence descriptions did not identify an offence known to law.  In that case, the offence stated in the search warrants was defrauding the Commonwealth contrary to s 29D of the Crimes Act.  The complaint was that the particulars for the offence, referring to a failure to disclose “assessable income”, were inconsistent with s 161(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth).  In that regard, it was submitted by the unsuccessful appellant that s 161(1) was directed to an obligation to report “total income”, encompassing capital gains or profits, which are not embraced within the ordinary understanding of the word “income”.  On that basis, it was said that the warrants failed to disclose a relevant alleged offence.  The Full Court did not accept the appellant’s argument, considering that the expression “assessable income” means simply all of the income received which may be assessable income under the legislation.  The Full Court further considered, at 558A, that the particularisation of the offence by reference to the omission of “assessable” income was not only not misleading, but “actually assists the reader of the warrants to understand better the nature of the offence alleged than if the matter had rested with a general statement of the offence in the language of s 29D”.  In a similar way, focusing on a portion of a suspected offending period may well assist by making the directly authorised ambit of search narrower or more comprehensible.  That is to say that the inclusion of an approximate date or limited date range, while perhaps not being precise to the standard of an indictment, may be more helpful than not doing so in a search warrant.121    It follows that the search warrant offence descriptions were not beyond the scope of the affidavit by which each warrant was obtained, and there was no fatal departure from the information that was before the issuing officer.122    It should be added that the criticisms made by the primary judge of the drafting of the search warrants were well observed and soundly reasoned.  However, as his Honour concluded, the search warrants were sufficient for the statutory purpose of confining the object of the search that was authorised and provided sufficient guidance as to what was and was not permitted to be seized.  123    There was no error demonstrated in the conclusion reached by the primary judge.  Both of these grounds of appeal should therefore fail.Whether parts of the warrant found to be invalid should have been severed (ground 3)Third appeal ground as pleaded124    Mr Caratti’s third ground of appeal is stated as follows:His Honour should have found that neither of the offences in the Third Condition of the Warrant was severable and should not have found that, even if it were found that the statement of the Whitby Land Company offence was defective, it does not necessarily follow that the warrants as a whole would be declared invalid: [154].Findings of the primary judge relevant to the third appeal ground125    The primary judge observed that, if contrary to his Honour’s conclusion that the statement of the third suspected offence was sufficient to define the search perimeter of the warrants, it would have been necessary to consider whether that part of the warrants could appropriately be severed.  At [154], his Honour declined to express a concluded view, stating:Given the conclusion that has been reached, it is unnecessary to decide whether it would have been appropriate to sever this description of the Whitby Land Company offence from the warrants.  There is, however, much to be said for the proposition that an invalid statement of one offence in the third condition of the warrants could appropriately be severed without doing violence to the balance of the warrants.  Thus, even if it had been found that the statement of the Whitby Land Company offence was deficient, it would not necessarily follow that the warrants as a whole would be declared invalid.Appellant’s submissions on the third appeal ground126    Mr Caratti contended that, upon there being a finding that an offence in the third condition of the warrants is invalid, the whole of the warrant should be declared invalid, having regard to the integral role the third condition plays in specifying the kinds of evidential material to be searched for under the warrants and the extent of the searches and seizures that were carried out.Respondent’s submissions on the third appeal ground127    The Commissioner submitted that the primary judge was correct to consider that, had the warrants been invalid in respect of their statement of the third offence, that defect might be validly severed from the warrant.  It was submitted that it is irrelevant to the issue of severability that the searches and seizures were extensive and that documents were seized in relation to each company.  Whether a part of a warrant is severable was said to depend on the meaning of the warrant and the objective intention of the issuing officer, not the manner in which the warrant is executed.  Thus to assert that the third offence was “integral” to the warrants is to assume the answer to the relevant inquiry.  Consideration of the third appeal ground128    As no further finding of invalidity has been found, there is no issue of severance.  However, in the event that the conclusions reached about any of the offence descriptions are wrong, that invalidity could and would have been met by severance.  That was an aspect of the outcome reached by the Full Court in Parker v Churchill at 336.4 and 352.3, in which part of a second-listed offence and all of a fourth-listed offence were found to be invalid, but the balance of the search warrants were held to be valid, giving effective severance.  129    Although there was some overlap in the offences in this case, especially between the first and second offences, each was capable of operating and taking effect separately.  There was not the sort of cross-contamination found to be present in Coco at 443-4.  130    It follows that there was no error in the conclusion reached by the primary judge.  This ground of appeal must therefore also fail.Whether the execution of the warrants was invalid (ground 4; part of ground 2 below)Fourth appeal ground as pleaded131    Mr Caratti’s fourth ground of appeal is stated as follows:His Honour erred in finding that the Warrants as a whole were lawfully executed in accordance with their terms ([485]).  His Honour should have made the following findings, and held that these matters, by themselves or in combination, were such that the Warrants as a whole were lawfully executed in accordance with their terms.(i)    Given the “ambiguity” and “lack of clarity” in the charges, and given the confusion of some officers, his Honour (contrary to [307]-[310]) should have inferred that a sufficient number of officers had a similarly imperfect understanding of the offences in the Third Condition of the Warrants, such that the execution of the Warrants was invalid.(ii)    His Honour should have held (contrary to [326]-[334]) that Mr Irvin of the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) was not aware of the content of the Warrants yet had extensive involvement in giving advice to executing officers, advice given by him to executing officers was based not on the offences in the Third Condition of the Warrants but rather on his background knowledge of the ATO audits and the ATO referral to the AFP and there was a “material disjunct” between Mr Irvin's background knowledge of the ATO audit and the ATO referral to the AFP, on the one hand, and, on the other, the offences in the Warrants.(iii)    His Honour should have held (contrary to [335]-[346]) that the ""Search Relevances"" document, which was created by Mr Irvin, was created without regard to the Warrants, there was a material disjunct between the Search Relevances document and the offences in the Warrants, the Search Relevances document was widely distributed to executing officers and, taking into account the “ambiguity” and “lack of clarity” in the charges, it should be inferred that the use of the Search Relevances document was such that the Warrants were invalidly executed.Findings of the primary judge on the fourth appeal ground132    In considering Mr Caratti’s challenges at first instance to the execution of the search warrants, the primary judge recorded some general impressions and findings concerning the evidence of the execution of the warrants as a whole.  It is convenient to reproduce those findings below:283    The execution of the search warrants was an extremely large and complex logistical and operational exercise.  The execution of the warrant at the Wickham Street premises occurred over three days.  It involved upwards of 70 AFP and tax officers.  The Duncraig Road warrant involved more than 20 officers.  The execution of the Irvin Street, Cornish Turn and Harrisdale warrants were smaller exercises, but even so they involved a relatively large number of officers:  eight in the case of the Irvin Street premises; fifteen in the case of the Cornish Turn premises; and twelve in the case of the Wright Road premises.  Mr Caratti’s contentions concerning certain aspects of the execution of the warrants must be considered in the context of the size and complexity of the overall operation.284    This large and complex operation was overseen by Federal Agent Nicholson.  He delivered the main operational briefing that was the subject of one of Mr Caratti’s complaints.  Federal Agent Nicholson was an impressive and credible witness.  There is no reason whatsoever to doubt that Federal Agent Nicholson genuinely intended to ensure that all warrants were executed fairly and in accordance with their terms and the relevant provisions of the Crimes Act.  There is also no reason whatsoever to doubt the he did what he considered was necessary and desirable to ensure, as best he could, that the warrants were properly and reasonably executed. 285    One of the operational difficulties faced by Federal Agent Nicholson was that, given the size and complexity of the operation, it was necessary for him to engage the services of a large number of Federal Agents who had not had any, or any significant, prior involvement in Operation Caballus or the investigation into the offences allegedly committed by Mr Caratti and Ms Bazzo.  That difficulty was compounded by at least two other matters. 286    First, the investigation and the warrants concerned matters of considerable factual and legal complexity.  In short terms, the offences to which the warrants related involved allegations concerning the income tax and GST affairs of several companies over a number of years.  It might reasonably be inferred that a number of the Federal Agents involved in the execution of the warrants were not particularly well-versed in the fine detail of the tax legislation that underlay the various alleged offences.287    Second, as has already been pointed out at length, the search warrants were drafted in terms that did not make the task faced by the officers who were to execute the warrants any easier.  For the reasons already given, the warrants were validly issued and complied with the requirements of the Crimes Act.  They were, however, in a number of respects poorly drafted and difficult to understand.  In practical terms, it was always going to be difficult for Federal Agents who had no previous involvement in the relevant investigation, or who had no significant knowledge or experience in tax related matters, to make the required search and seizure decisions without some assistance.288    Federal Agent Nicholson sought to deal with those operational difficulties in two ways.  First, he distributed a detailed tactical plan and conducted a briefing in relation to the execution of the warrants.  Second, he arranged to have a large number of tax officers, including some with direct knowledge and involvement in the tax affairs of Mr Caratti and companies associated with him, to assist in the execution of the warrants. 133    Mr Caratti’s challenges to the execution of the search warrants at trial were dealt with by the primary judge in five key parts.  134    First, it was contended that the briefing conducted by Federal Agent Nicholson was insufficient to ensure that the relevant officers had a proper understanding of the warrants, and that, in any event, not all of the executing officers attended the briefing, or received the tactical plan, and no record was kept of the attendees.  The primary judge rejected these contentions, considering that the evidence demonstrated that the briefing was adequate in all the circumstances, or at least was not inadequate.  His Honour took care to stress that while the briefings may have been important having regard to the complexity of the warrants, the primary focus of the inquiry into the reasonableness of the execution of the warrants should be the decisions made and actions taken.  It would only be if deficiencies of the briefing fed through into the actual execution of the warrants that the briefings would be of any particular significance. 135    Secondly, Mr Caratti contended that the evidence revealed that the Federal Agents who were involved in executing the warrants misunderstood and had inconsistent understandings of the terms of the warrants, particularly in relation to the third condition.  This was said to be demonstrated, for example, by evidence that suggested discrepancies in the understandings of certain Federal Agents as to whether references in the first, second and third offences to 2008 referred to the 2008 income year or calendar year.  In rejecting this contention, the primary judge found that it could not be inferred that all or even a majority of the 50 Federal Agents involved had an imperfect or incomplete understanding of the offences.  Furthermore, it could not be concluded that an imperfect understanding or appreciation of the dates would necessarily lead to seizure of documents not properly seizable under the warrants, nor could it be said that any confusion as to dates meant that the search and seizure was effectively “unlimited as to time”. 136    Thirdly, Mr Caratti made a number of distinct contentions about the involvement of tax officers in the execution of the warrants.  Perhaps most significantly, it was said that the Federal Agents had improperly deferred to advice given by tax officers in the course of executing the warrants.  This submission was rejected by the primary judge on the basis that it could not be concluded that the executing officers simply followed the directions of the tax officers and did not turn their minds to whether a document properly satisfied the conditions in the warrant.  Moreover, his Honour considered that it was both permissible and reasonable for Federal Agent Nicholson to request the assistance of tax officers in executing warrants, noting the rhetorical comment of Lockhart J in Dunesky v Commonwealth at 502:  “Who better to assist in the identification of relevant documents … than the tax officers who are intimately conversant with the subject matter of their audits?”137    Fourthly, Mr Caratti contended that advice given by tax officers during the execution of the warrants concerning the seizure of documents was based on a “misguided” understanding of the offences to which the warrants related.  Having regard to a lack of evidential foundation for the appellant’s challenges, his Honour rejected the contention that certain tax officers – Mr Irvin, Mr Crawshaw, and Ms Milner – were variously not aware of the warrants, did not base their advice on the warrant conditions and conflated or confused the audit and referral information with the warrant offences.138    Fifthly, Mr Caratti contended that the distribution of a “Search Relevances” document – prepared by Mr Irvin to provide more detail concerning the allegations that were the basis of the offences – meant that the warrants were unreasonably or excessively executed.  Notwithstanding some concern about the inherent risk that such a document will be given undue prominence and perhaps even become a surrogate for the warrant itself, the primary judge rejected the appellant’s contention.  His Honour did not accept that the document was given any undue prominence, nor could any direct causal connection be established between the use of the document and the seizure of any item.  Appellant’s submissions on the fourth appeal ground139    Mr Caratti challenged the primary judge’s conclusions in three key respects.  140    First, it was said that the primary judge should have held that the patent “ambiguity” and “lack of clarity” of the offences in the third condition meant that a significant number of the 50 officers involved in executing the warrants had an imperfect or incomplete understanding of the nature of the offences, resulting in improper seizures.  Again, such was said to be demonstrated by evidence that Federal Agent van Tooren and Federal Agent Szolnoki had differing understandings as to whether the reference to “2008” in the offences referred to an income year or calendar year.  It was submitted further that, contrary to the findings of the primary judge, an inference should be drawn that a sufficient number of the executing officers had an imperfect understanding of the offences, and that it should not be incumbent on the appellant to call every officer to give evidence of their understanding.  141    Secondly, it was contended that, contrary to the primary judge’s conclusion, execution of the search warrants miscarried by reason of advice given by Mr Irvin in the course of the process.  Mr Caratti submitted that Mr Irvin had not read or even seen the warrants prior to execution, and that his advice to officers was based on his background knowledge of the ATO audit and referral, giving rise to a “material disjunct” between his understanding of the offences and the terms of the warrants themselves.  This disjunct is said to have infected the execution of the warrants by reason of Mr Irvin’s authority and ostensible influence over the process.  142    Finally, it was contended that inclusion of Mr Irvin’s Search Relevances document in packs distributed to some of those involved in the execution of the warrants resulted in the warrants being unreasonably or excessively executed.  The Search Relevances document, prepared by Mr Irvin without having read the warrants, is said to disclose on its face a similar disjunct between his understanding of the offences and the terms of the warrants themselves.  By way of illustration, it was pointed out that the document confusingly named persons and entities that were not included in the second condition of the warrants, which Mr Irvin suggested in cross-examination was for the purpose of giving examples of what was excluded from the search.  Further, it was said that those executing the warrants could also easily have misinterpreted a dot point in item 4 of the document stating “Gucce failed to report all sales on BAS – NON-COMPLIANT”, which was conceded to be unclear by Mr Irvin in cross-examination before the primary judge.  Respondent’s submissions on the fourth appeal ground143    The Commissioner’s position was that Mr Caratti has failed to discharge the onus of showing that the warrants were not executed in accordance with their terms, relying on Williams v Keelty at [235] (to which should be added a reference to [236]).  It was said that the matters relied on by Mr Caratti do not individually or cumulatively suggest that any item was seized unlawfully, let alone render open a finding that the warrants as a whole were not executed lawfully.  The Commissioner stressed that “practical considerations” must be borne in mind, citing Baker v Campbell at 83.  It was submitted that there was no error in the primary judge’s conclusion that the executing officers did not rely on the Search Relevances document when conducting the search, and that his Honour’s finding was reached with the benefit of extensive oral evidence and cross-examination of a number of those officers.  144    It was further said that Mr Caratti’s challenges under this ground of appeal fail to address the process which the AFP put in place to facilitate the proper, fair, and careful execution of the warrants.  This process included multiple briefings at various stages of the operation, distribution of hard copies of the warrant conditions to all involved in execution, and the assistance of a number of ATO officers in evaluating the relevance of documents.  145    The Commissioner also submitted that the contention that Mr Irvin did not read the warrants is not established by the transcript references relied on, and the fact that Mr Irvin did not see the warrant prior to execution does not mean that he did not see it during execution.  Moreover, it was submitted that there was sufficient evidence to infer that Mr Irvin had an understanding of the warrant conditions, having been present at the general briefing, the field briefing, and likely having been provided with a copy of the warrant during execution.Consideration of the fourth appeal ground146    Mr Caratti faces a substantial hurdle, both legal and factual, in advancing this appeal ground.  The legal hurdle is that, as already discussed, the primary judge’s conclusions as to the clarity of the search warrant offence provisions being sufficient for their purpose reached should be upheld on appeal.  The factual hurdle is the difficult task of demonstrating that the factual findings and conclusions reached by reference to evidence, including oral evidence, were not open to the primary judge, as opposed merely to being less preferable in some way to those that Mr Caratti asserts should have been made.  147    The conclusions reached by the primary judge turned not just on the documentary and affidavit evidence before his Honour, but also on cross-examination.  His Honour’s conclusions, many of a value judgment or inferential nature, were interwoven with character and credit findings which this Court is in no position to gainsay on appeal.  That is especially so when no attempt was made to take the Court, orally or in writing, to any specific conclusions to point, with precision, to error.  In those circumstances, error has not been demonstrated.  It is therefore appropriate to proceed upon the basis that the factual findings by his Honour are correct, in the sense of being open or available to be made.148    In particular, the primary judge concluded that the ATO officers, while doubtless a source of valuable guidance and advice, did not ultimately dictate what would or would not be seized.  His Honour illustrated this by reference to ATO views being overruled when they entailed a departure from consideration and comparison with the terms of the relevant search warrant.  149    Given that no attempt was made to demonstrate error by reference to any physical item seized, admittedly a difficult path to impugning the whole process, the findings of the primary judge must be viewed as compelling.  No proper basis has been demonstrated for departing from them, let alone for concluding that they entail error.  Conclusion on the fourth appeal ground150    The challenge to the findings of the primary judge as to the execution of the search warrants must also fail.Whether the electronic material found to have been unlawfully seized should have been ordered to be returned (ground 5)Fifth appeal ground as pleaded151    Mr Caratti’s fifth ground of appeal is stated as follows:His Honour erred in:(i)    finding that there is no reason in principle why the permitted use and retention of unlawfully seized material should be on different and narrower terms than that which the statutory regime envisages: reasons for decision of 23 November 2016 at [9];(ii)    describing as neither “deliberate, contumelious or even reckless”, an inadequate understanding of the circumstances in which an electronic storage device can be seized on execution of a warrant under the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth): [471];(iii)    failing to find that it would undermine the statutory regime to now permit the First Respondent to “do what they should have done, or considered doing”, but didn't do, or consider doing, at the time mandated by statute: [474], [478];(iv)    failing to find that the unlawfully seized material should be returned or in the alternative failing to find that it should not be used other than for the purpose of obtaining advice in respect of, investigation and prosecution of any of the “offence[s] to which the warrants relate” within the meaning of that term in s.3E(5)(a) of the Crimes Act 1914: [475], [487] and reasons for decision on 23November 2016 at [9]-[11].Findings of the primary judge relevant to the fifth appeal ground152    The primary judge concluded that a number of items of electronic equipment had been unlawfully seized.  Generally, those findings reflected a failure by the AFP to copy the data or files contained on the equipment at the premises, or to consider whether that course of action was impracticable, instead of seizing the equipment itself without first taking those steps.  As a matter of the Court’s discretion, however, his Honour made orders permitting the Commissioner to inspect the items seized and, if satisfied in terms of s 3 (1A) of the Crimes Act, copy the data in the manner permitted by s 3L(1A)(a).  In adopting this approach, his Honour rejected a submission made by Mr Caratti that the Court’s discretion not to order the return of unlawfully seized items was, as a matter apparently of implicit principle, confined to the circumstances where criminal proceedings were already on foot or it had been shown that the items seized might afford relevant evidence of the commission of the alleged offence.  No proper basis for that principle was evident upon his Honour’s examination of the decisions in Puglisi v Australian Fisheries Management Authority (1997) 148 ALR 393, Cassaniti v Croucher (1997) 37 ATR 269 and Wright v Queensland Police Service [2002] QSC 46; [2002] 2 Qd R 667.  Similarly, his Honour considered that the decision of CC v Rayney [2012] WASC 56; 42 WAR 498, relied on by Mr Carrati, did not provide any assistance to his case.153    The relevant question, the primary judge held, was whether the desirability of allowing the police to retain the illegally seized items outweighed the undesirability of permitting the police to retain the items, having regard to the way in which they were obtained.  In this regard, his Honour did not consider that the circumstances of the seizures were “deliberate, contumelious or even reckless”, but rather the product of an inadequate understanding, or perhaps misunderstanding, of the circumstances in which an electronic storage device can be seized.  Taking into account the potential relevance the material might have to the decision to institute criminal proceedings, his Honour was prepared to allow the Commissioner to copy or take an image of the relevant data or files on the unlawfully seized devices.  This, it was said, would be to permit the AFP to do what they should have done in the first place. Appellant’s submissions on the fifth appeal ground154    Two key errors were asserted in the primary judge’s findings.  First, it was said that the primary judge mischaracterised the breaches of the Crimes Act in describing the seizures as neither “deliberate, contumelious or even reckless”.  It was submitted that the primary judge should have held that the lack of appreciation or ignorance of the terms of s 3L of the Crimes Act on the part of the seizing officers amounted at least to reckless disregard for the relevant provisions.  The appellant suggested that key figures in the execution of the warrants, including Federal Agents Nicolson and Jirasinha, were of the belief that if an electronic device was thought to contain evidential material, the device itself could be seized without further consideration.  In light of such a fundamental misunderstanding infecting the process from the top down, it was said that his Honour’s discretion had miscarried.155    Secondly, the appellant submitted that his Honour committed an error of principle in exercising the discretion to permit the further interrogation of the unlawfully seized electronic material.  Relevantly, it was submitted that the outer boundaries of possible purposes for which unlawfully seized electronic equipment might be used are set by the common law, not by the Crimes Act.  Respondent’s submissions on the fifth appeal ground156    The submissions for the Commissioner were to the effect that it was open to the primary judge to reach the conclusions that his Honour did, including upon the basis that recklessness requires more than an inadequate understanding of the law.  It was suggested that there would at least need to be a finding of an awareness of the possibility that that the conduct was unlawful, a proposition that was never put to the witnesses concerned, and a finding that the primary judge did not make.  In the absence of any evidence that the officers concerned did not turn their minds to the terms of the relevant search warrant, there was no basis for finding error.  157    On the issue of discretion, the Commissioner submitted that it was open to his Honour to make orders judicially and by reference to the law, which included the provisions of the Crimes Act.Consideration of the fifth appeal ground158    Once the determination was made that the computer hardware had been unlawfully seized, it was a matter of discretion as to whether the return of those items should be ordered.  The principles in that regard were set out by Hill J in Puglisi at 403-405.  Those principles do not need to be spelt out or repeated.  The primary judge plainly exercised his Honour’s discretion by reference to those principles, applying a careful and reasoned process.  It is worth noting in that regard that in Puglisi, all of the material seized had been obtained by way of a wholly invalid search warrant.  In an attempt to remedy that problem, a fresh search warrant was obtained, to be relied on as a basis to reseize the material immediately upon its return.  The process of return, however, was not completed, such that no valid seizure could take place.  As a consequence, the ongoing retention of the material continued to rely upon the prior invalid seizure.  In considering those circumstances, Hill J nonetheless declined to order that the seized material be returned.  His Honour regarded that use of the material was a matter best left to the criminal courts in the exercise of discretion as to the admissibility of illegally obtained evidence.  The outcome arrived at by the primary judge in this case was more nuanced than in Puglisi, dealing, as his Honour was, with electronic evidence and not just physical documents.159    Once it is appreciated that it was open to the primary judge, in the exercise of the discretion discussed in Puglisi, not to make any order to return any of the illegally seized items, much of Mr Caratti’s case falls away.  That is especially so when issue is taken with orders which were, at least technically, more narrow than was open to his Honour to make.  In particular, his Honour arrived at a solution that mirrored the legislative scheme by allowing the data on the illegally seized electronic equipment to be copied before requiring the physical items to be returned.  The copied data could then be examined and then either seized or destroyed.  This reflected what should have happened in the first place.160    The characterisation of the approach of the primary judge as improperly applying the provisions of s 3L(1A) of the Crimes Act is therefore misconceived.  It is clear that his Honour did not purport to permit the powers under s 3L(1A) to be exercised by the Commissioner per se.  Rather, his Honour’s approach was to make discretionary orders in terms guided by that provision.  That course was plainly available to his Honour, given the wide powers to tailor such relief to the circumstances at hand.  161    Mr Caratti’s case also depends on challenging the primary judge’s exercise of discretion upon the basis that a different outcome should have been reached, without meeting the necessary hurdle of showing that the conclusion arrived at, even if not preferable, was not open to his Honour.  Faced with what might have been a binary choice between permitting unqualified retention and ordering unqualified return, his Honour was doing no more than using the legislative provisions as a guide to a compromise position in the discretionary exercise of wide remedial powers.  In that way, the legislative intent, which permitted examination of data prior to any formal seizure, could ultimately be achieved, albeit not in the manner or timeframe envisaged.  162    This was not a case of ignoring the constraints in the legislative regime, but rather of using it as a principled and rational guide to the exercise of discretion.  The alternative was either to revert to the binary choice or to make orders without guidance.  If forced to the binary choice, the appropriate stance on the part of the primary judge may have been to allow for retention, and to leave the question of what use may be permitted in the event of prosecution taking place to be determined by a court exercising federal criminal jurisdiction, as happened in Puglisi.  In any event, on the authority of Puglisi, the correctness of which has not been questioned, that was a course available to his Honour.  The alternative course taken cannot be said to be one that was not available.163    The fifth ground of appeal is therefore without merit and should be dismissed.Comment on the Commissioner of the AFP obtaining proper legal advice164    Search warrants are a highly invasive process by which fundamental rights are encroached upon.  However, they continue to be a vital part of effective criminal investigation and prosecution.  That is unlikely to change.  To the contrary, the relevance of search warrants may even increase, as the vast array of material and information stored digitally continues to expand.  Appropriate balancing of the competing considerations is best achieved by careful attention to the quality of the process, especially in complex “white collar” cases.165    The primary judge made the following observations about the inadequacies in the search warrants, criticising the quality of the process in this case, and noting what had been done in the past to avoid this occurring:242    There appears to be an unfortunate tendency, in the drafting of three condition warrants, to draft the first condition in such broad terms that it provides no effective filter or guide to the search.  The warrants in this case are a good example of this tendency.  Often the first condition contains an extensive and broadly drafted list of just about every type of document or electronic device that could possibly exist.  When it comes to executing a warrant drafted in such terms, there would be little point in executing officers having regard to the first condition when making search and seizure decisions.  That is because, whatever item is located, it will almost inevitably fall within the extensive list in the first condition.  243    Equally, there is a tendency to draft the second condition so as to include the longest possible list of persons, entities, addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers and bank accounts that it is possible to compile.  “Things” will meet the condition if they “relate to” any one or more of the persons or entities or address included in that long list.  As already indicated, the expression “relate to” in this context is not only extremely wide, but also potentially vague and indefinite:  Williams v Keelty at 211-212 [158].  It follows that often the second condition is also not a particularly effective filter or guide to what may constitute evidential material.  In most cases, just about everything located at the subject premises is likely to relate to one or more of the persons, entities or other things listed in the second condition. 244    What that means is that frequently the third condition of the warrant is the only effective filter in the warrant.  That may not be a problem in circumstances were the third condition is drafted with care and the greatest degree of precision and particularity that is possible at the stage that the investigation may be at.  In the past, the AFP frequently sought the advice and assistance of experienced lawyers and prosecutors at the Office of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions in relation to the drafting of search warrants in complex matters.  Regrettably that no longer seems to be the case.  It does not appear to have happened in this case.  If it had, many of the issues that have arisen in relation to the issue and form of the warrants in question would probably not have arisen.245    If appropriate care is not taken in the drafting of the third condition in a warrant, one likely result is a challenge to the warrant, similar to the challenge that has occurred in this case.  While the warrants in question in this case have been found to be valid (other than the one severed paragraph), for the reasons already given, the third condition offences were very poorly drafted.  Mr Caratti’s complaints concerning the drafting of the warrants were by no means frivolous or entirely baseless.246    Throughout the proceedings the Commissioner maintained a stoic and somewhat blinkered position that there was no problem with the drafting of the third condition in the warrants.  Mr Caratti’s complaints concerning the third condition were met by the constant refrain that the statement of the offence in a warrant need not meet a “high bar”.  The Commissioner’s suggestion that there was no problem with the drafting of the warrants was unrealistic, if not fanciful.  While a warrant must be approached in a practical and common sense way, and not with overzealous technicality, that does not mean, as the Commissioner effectively suggested, that s 3E created only a “low bar”.247    Poorly drafted three condition warrants serve only to invite controversy and judicial review challenges.  As these proceedings show, such challenges can end up being long, complex and drawn out affairs.  They result in an unfortunate fragmentation and delay of criminal investigations. 248    The second likely result of poorly drafted warrants is that the execution of the warrants is almost invariably rendered more difficult.  To determine if an item is able to be seized, executing officers are required to consider and comprehend the offences listed in the third condition of the warrant.  As executing officers and constables assisting are unlikely to be legally trained, that may not always be an easy task, particularly where the offences relate to complex commercial or tax-related affairs.  The task is rendered even more difficult where, as is often the case, the executing officers and persons assisting have not had any or any extensive involvement in the relevant investigation.  The task is rendered more difficult still where the third condition offences are not drafted with appropriate care, precision and particularity.  249    There was some evidence that suggested that some of the officers involved in the execution of the warrants may have had an imperfect appreciation of the meaning and scope of the search warrants.  Perhaps not surprisingly, Federal Agents who had not been involved in the investigation appeared to have sought the assistance of tax officers and, in some instances, appeared to use extrinsic aids to assist them to make appropriate search and seizure decisions.  …  The evidence of what occurred during the execution of the warrants is not relevant or admissible in relation to Mr Caratti’s challenge to the validity of the warrants:  Williams v Keelty at 211 [157].  Nevertheless, the evidence concerning the execution of the warrants in issue in this matter serves to illustrate the difficulties and complexities that may arise where warrants concerning complex investigations are not drafted with sufficient care and precision. 166    Those sentiments should be endorsed and enlarged upon.  167    The consequences of the approach taken to the drafting of the search warrants were made clear by this case.  In addition to raising questions of validity of the search warrants, the lack of clarity in the drafting gave rise to further risks in the execution of those warrants.  As was noted by the primary judge, the lead investigator is to be acknowledged for the practical steps he took to ameliorate those difficulties.  That remedial approach might well have failed, especially if the drafting had crossed the line from being merely poor to legally insufficient. 168    It should be observed also that the last two appeal grounds turned on the primary judge’s remedial approach to the problems created by way of severance and by way of orders to facilitate steps being taken that should have taken place at the time of execution of the search warrants.  That, again, was only necessary because of the deficiencies in the drafting.  169    It follows that, in one way or another, the drafting of the search warrants was the direct, or substantial indirect, source of all of the issues and problems in this case.  This was an ultimately expensive and time-consuming way to conduct an investigation.  The time that might have been saved by inadequate drafting has been lost many times over.  170    The consequence of an overall investigative approach to risk management characterised by insufficient resourcing and attention to the importance of rudimentary search warrant drafting was not just the commencement of this litigation, but also the protracted delay in resolving the many difficult issues confronted by the primary judge and by this Court on appeal.  Such delay in carrying out and concluding a criminal investigation is highly undesirable for all concerned.  171    When proper regard is had to the importance of the efficient, effective and fair obtaining and execution of search warrants, and the delay, fragmentation of the criminal investigation process, cost, time of the parties and the use of scarce court time when challenged, the obtaining of proper independent legal advice by a criminal law expert would seem to be a wise investment for the Commissioner.  Taking that step has the prospect of an uncommonly high return on outlay.  In complex fraud investigations in particular, or in like investigations concerning other forms of alleged higher level “white collar” offending, careful independent consideration and legal advice as to the terms of the search warrants sought to be obtained, and perhaps as to the content of the affidavit by which they are sought, including the alignment between the two, would improve the process for all concerned, most particularly at the point of execution of any search warrant that is issued.  The time and cost would pale into insignificance when regard is had to the history of these proceedings.172    In particular, as has happened in the past, obtaining advice from experienced solicitors with the Office of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, perhaps supplemented by the private Bar, may save everyone concerned considerable trouble and expense.  This is an area in which practical criminal law experience is of greatest assistance.  At the very least, that would help to ensure that judicial review challenges are able to be focussed on matters of substance, rather than form, and are thereby able to be heard and determined, either way, much more quickly.Conclusion overall173    As all of the grounds of appeal should fail, the appeal should be dismissed.I certify that the preceding one hundred and seventy-three (173) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justices Logan, Rangiah and Bromwich.Associate: Dated:    10 November 2017",2017-11-10 00:00:00,Federal Court of Australia

Sentencing Remarks of Mr Justice Edis  

Southwark Crown Court 

 10th November 2017 

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ABOUT CASE 

The five defendants for sentence today were convicted after a very long trial of an offence of 
conspiracy to cheat the Revenue.  Michael Richards, Robert Gold and Rodney Whiston-Dew were 
also each convicted of a further substantive offence of cheating the Revenue, charged as counts 2, 3 
and 4 on the trial indictment respectively. 

Michael Richards is now 55 years old, Robert Gold is now 49, Rodney Whiston-Dew is 66, Jonathan 
Anwyl is 44, and Evdoros Demetriou is 78.  The offending occurred when they were all much 
younger, between 2004 and 2010.  They were arrested, for the most part, in July 2007 and, for the 
most part, charged in March 2010 and I will have to consider the reasons why the case has taken so 
long later.  It is, on any view, an unhappy state of affairs. 

This case involves a scheme whose chief characteristics were utter dishonesty, sophisticated 
planning, and astonishing greed hidden behind a mask of concern for the environment which adds 
an element of hypocrisy and cynicism to this case which is deeply distasteful.     

The four defendants who gave evidence each professed his deep passion for the environment and 
his determination to protect it by re-forestation projects abroad which would absorb carbon and so 
address climate change.  Whether that was ever truly the concern of any of them may be unclear, 
but by the time of this fraud I am quite certain that Richards, Gold and Whiston-Dew were simply 
motivated by a desire to become extremely rich and to evade tax on their proceeds of crime.   The 
sums involved mean that these defendants were playing for high stakes and they have lost. 

Taxation pays for public services which are stretched and which are designed to benefit or protect 
those in need and to improve and protect the conditions in which the whole population lives.  The 
public needs protection from cheats who dishonestly seek to evade paying it.  It is difficult and 
expensive to detect and prove cases such as this, and an element of deterrence in sentencing is 
required.
--------
The sophisticated planning was devoted to the financial requirements of the fraud and of extracting 
its proceeds, and the determination to prevent anyone outside the conspiracy from learning the true 
extent of the common control of what appeared to be independent companies operating at arms’ 
length.    The arrangements for the work which was the ostensible purpose of the scheme were 
slapdash and amateurish.  In the desperate rush to get hold of money in early 2005 the scheme was 
sold to investors before any of its key elements had actually been agreed.  It was a scheme at that 
stage which was still under construction.  Efforts to try and make something of it afterwards were 
genuinely made, but it was never possible to overcome the bungling at the start, and there was, in 
any case, nowhere near enough money or expertise to make it work.  It was a very effective fraud 
based on a very bad reforestation project.  I accept that Jon Awnyl worked very hard to try and make 
the reforestation project work, but he failed. 

The scheme was sold on the basis of land options over land which no-one had bothered to ensure 
was actually available, and which was said to be owned by an entirely fraudulent entity called 
Growth Fund Partnership in the United States.  This was little more than a set of dishonest accounts 
which showed an asset value of $11bn.  As far as the evidence in the case reveals, it was actually 
worth nothing at all.  Richards and Gold knew this perfectly well, having had extensive dealings with 
the man who commissioned that bogus set of accounts, Jack Birnholz, now deceased, when he 
swapped worthless shares in his company for their worthless shares in theirs.  This was done to 
make readers of the accounts of both companies believe that they were worth much more than they 
were.  It was not part of the count 1 fraud but gave Richards and Gold an insight into the true value 
of the Growth Fund when the count 1 was fraud was planned and executed.  The Growth Fund 
Partnership was the company which granted the land options and which also granted the Business 
Asset Put Option (BAPO) of which more detail appears below.  These were both key components of 
the scheme as marketed and they were simply dishonest from the start.  There was no land and no 
cash and no security for the Put Option and there never could be.  These dishonest fictions were 
central to the decisions of many people to invest in the scheme which generated money for the 
conspirators. 

The agreements which were key to the scheme were concocted by the conspirators and were 
uncommercial and unreal.  This had to be the case because any honest lawyer being asked to draft 
them would want to know a lot more than the conspirators could divulge.  The Information 
Memoranda for the scheme were deeply dishonest documents for the same reason.  When Mr. 
Sayer of Addleshaws (solicitors) quoted for the work necessary to prepare an honest Information 
Memorandum his instructions were discontinued.  Any enquiry by that firm into the substance of 
what the document said would have shown its falsity.  The firm’s name appeared in the document 
nevertheless, a tell-tale sign of its bare-faced dishonesty. 

Richards, Gold, Whiston-Dew and Demetriou had lived exemplary lives until this scam drew them in, 
but when it did so they entirely lost their moral compass and sold themselves to greed.  This is less 
true of Anwyl who was then a young man who I am quite satisfied was corrupted by the others, 
having agreed to join his “dream opportunity” in good faith.  By the time of the Scientific Research 
Agreements in March 2005, however, he knew that the scheme was based the fiction that Carbon 
Positive Trading Limited (CPTL) was an independent company providing services at arms’ length 
when in reality he was working under the instructions of Richards, Gold, Whiston-Dew and, later, 
Demetriou.  As a result of this he too became knowingly involved in very serious dishonesty and 
must pay the price.  The use of his naivety by older and more experienced men is an aggravating 
feature in each of the cases of the other four defendants.
--------
THE WAY IN WHICH IT WAS DONE 

The conspiracy offence involved an intended loss to the taxpayer of £107m, in that the conspirators 
created, marketed and administered a tax incentivised investment scheme which was intended to 
create a claim for sideways loss relief against income tax for anyone who invested in it.  This relief 
was available to them because the tax system was designed to encourage investors to support 
environmentally beneficial schemes and to fund research and development to improve the stock of 
human knowledge in the preservation of the natural world.  The investors were able to save a lot of 
tax while believing that they were doing good for the world.  Even better from their point of view, 
the scheme enabled them to claim tax relief on the spending of money which they had never 
actually had in the first place.  This was a very popular device and some 730 people invested large 
sums of money and claimed tax relief in the total amount of £107m which they hoped they would 
not have to pay, or which would be repaid to them by HMRC.  They were all high net worth 
individuals or sophisticated investors and most, perhaps all, were advised by Independent Financial 
Advisers.  This is not a case where the sentence should be increased to reflect harm to vulnerable 
victims.  The victims in this case were the public, those who pay the taxes which these defendants 
sought to evade. 

The investors each became a partner in a Limited Liability Partnership which then commissioned 
Carbon Positive Trading Limited to carry out research and development at a cost of £7.1m per LLP.  
That was the price payable, up front, on the Scientific Research Agreement (SRA) which each LLP 
entered into with CPTL.  There were, in the end, 38 LLPs.  Each LLP purported to raise about £8.5m 
to fund the SRA and other costs.  By the end therefore, a scheme was created which appeared to 
have raised investment of 38 x £8.5m = £323m.  Of that, 38 x £7.1m appeared to have been spent on 
Research and Development namely £269.8m.  The investors made tax relief claims on that basis.  In 
fact, nothing of the kind had happened. 

Rather less than 20% of the apparent value of the investment actually existed.  This was the 
substantial sum of £65m.  The remaining 80% was thin air.  Each time an LLP was floated, money 
contributed by previous investors was passed to it by an offshore company which was owned and 
operated by the conspirators, namely Environmental Guarantee Corporation Limited based in the 
Isle of Man.  The LLP then passed that money to CPTL, the Research and Development contractor, an 
another offshore company registered in the British Virgin islands.  Each such payment was then 
recorded in the books of the LLP as a payment of £7.1m.  The conspirators never intended that the 
whole sum would be spent on R&D.  Instead, CPTL then passed 80% of it (£6.8m) back to EGC, where 
it was available to fund the next LLP or to be paid out according to the instructions of the 
conspirators for their personal benefit.  These payments by EGC were recorded by it as loans, but 
there was never any remote prospect that any of it would be repaid.  The same money went round 
and round in circles, and each time it passed Go it created an apparent expenditure which was the 
basis of a claim for tax relief by the investors. 

Tax relief was then claimed on a spend of £269.8m, although only £64.6m had actually been paid.  It 
was not even the conspirators’ intention that this 20% of the apparent expenditure would actually 
be spent on the work abroad.  In the end, only £16m was ever spent abroad on the reforestation 
project.  The rest was carved up by the conspirators.  £13.5m was paid from CPTL in Holland to a 
bank account set up in a Swiss Bank, EFG.  It was then paid by CPTL to another offshore British Virgin 
Islands company set up by the conspirators.  £12.5m was paid in this way in a 12 month period 
starting in October 2005 and divided between Richards, Gold, Whiston-Dew and Warwick Smith.  In 
each case the money was paid from this offshore non-trading BVI company into trusts established in 
Mauritius which were wholly controlled by these 4 defendants.  Each of these trusts had its own
--------
secret bank account at EFG in Switzerland.  During this period, substantial sums (over £1m) were 
paid on to Mr. Demetriou out of one of the trusts by Mr. Richards and payments were also made to 
Jon Anwyl, first in his own name and, later, to a trust which he set up in identical terms to those of 
the other conspirators.   

At a later stage, in 2008, a further payment of £1m was made to Demetriou as his reward for 
agreeing to help in perverting the course of justice by trying to con the HMRC investigation and civil 
proceedings before the Special Commissioners into believing that he was the owner of CPTL from 
the start when he was not.  Notes and fragments of paper show that that company was actually 
owned and controlled by Richards and Gold, with 42.5% each and Warwick Smith, with 10% and 
Rodney Whiston-Dew who had 5%.  That agreement was hatched in October 2005 very soon after 
the civil enquiry began and involved all these defendants in one way or another.  The lies told 
further to that agreement by Richards and Anwyl in those proceedings were told further to that 
agreement and each defendant is culpable in that respect.  There was a sophistication to this which 
is an aggravating feature of the case.  That is particularly so in the case of Richards who lied on oath 
before the Special Commissioner, when he pretended that CPTL and EGC were independent third 
parties and that he did not know what they did with the money which had been paid to CPTL or 
where EGC got its money from.  He knew those things perfectly well. 

The use of offshore trusts and companies is much in the news.  In this case it occurred so that the UK 
authorities could learn nothing about the fund, or the companies or about the ownership of the 
companies.  It was done dishonestly and for a fraudulent purpose. 

The use of offshore BVI companies, Swiss Bank accounts and trusts which were solely created to 
hide and launder the proceeds of the fraud is a seriously aggravating feature of this case, and it 
features in all 5 cases, as I shall explain when I deal with them individually. 

Other payments were made for the benefit of the conspirators by other means and the benefit 
figures in the benefit summary placed before the jury shows that a total of £23.5m was gained from 
the funds contributed by the investors and split between Richards (£7.4m), Gold (£5.3m), Whiston-
Dew (£1.3m), Anwyl (£1.7m), Demetriou (£7.8m), and Warwick Smith (£2.1m).   The shares of 
Richards and Gold and Warwick Smith include profits made from investments made into Sun 
Biofuels and New Forest Company Limited with money obtained from the fraud.  These figures are 
not precise because some money moved between conspirators after initial receipt.  The final resting 
place of some of this money has not yet been discovered.  They are a broad indicator of the level of 
benefit from the scheme and of control over it.  The ultimate destination of the money paid to 
Demetriou in Cyprus was not examined in evidence and I do not infer that this was all his proceeds.  
His involvement was as money launderer as well as to pretend to be the owner of CPTL.  I simply do 
not know why he received as much as he did, or for whose ultimate benefit he held this money.  He 
said nothing in interview and did not give evidence. 

The Business Asset Put Option (BAPO) was a means of reassuring investors that they would never 
have to repay their capital loan to EGC.  It was part of the “Risk Mitigation Strategy” put in place for 
this purpose and was necessary to make the scheme saleable.  Although investors said that they 
were “on the hook” for he loans, this was only ever a theoretical liability.  Anyone who was sued by 
EGC for repayment would want to know why the BAPO had turned out to be worthless and would 
rapidly discover that he had been defrauded.  The BAPO was a seriously aggravating feature of the 
case and involved Richards, Gold and Whiston-Dew.  There is no evidence that either Anwyl or 
Demetriou knew anything about this, and they were not involved in lying to investors in marketing 
the scheme.  Their lies concerned CPTL and its ownership and control.
--------
THE LOSS CAUSED 

In the event, HMRC quite quickly formed the view that the scheme involved the same money being 
passed round in circles between connected companies so that it appeared to have been spent when 
it had not been.  They rightly suspected circularity and common control and rejected the claims to 
sideways loss relief.  They did not make any payments of claims, but where an investor met his claim 
by setting off the loss against an outstanding liability, HMRC could not prevent that.  HMRC has 
sought repayments from such investors.  The result of all this is that this is a case of intended loss 
and not actual loss for the purposes of sentence.  I do not know how much loss was actually caused 
and will make this assumption which is favourable to the defendants, although its effect on sentence 
is limited in my judgment. 

That is because this is a case where the conspirators had done everything necessary to inflict the loss 
on the public and continued to try to force the claims to be met by ever growing dishonesty when 
HMRC had challenged them.  Although I shall sentence them on the basis that they failed entirely in 
this effort and were prevented from causing actual loss, in my judgment this has only a very limited 
impact on the gravity of the offence.   

An additional consideration here is that many cases where there is no actual loss will also, as a 
consequence, mean that there is no gain to the cheats.  That is not so here.  All these defendants 
benefited from the fraud.  The lowest level of benefit was to Anwyl, and he received a 7 figure sum.  
Further, Richards Gold and Whiston-Dew fall to be sentenced for personal tax counts where actual 
loss was caused in significant sums. 

MY APPROACH TO LEVEL OF BENEFIT AND PERSONAL TAX COUNTS 

The personal tax counts are very serious offences in themselves.  Brazen, sophisticated and 
persistent dishonesty, and very large amounts of unpaid tax tell their own story.  They are offences 
involving high culpability. 

In the case of Richards, he cheated the Revenue out of £2,327,372 in income and capital gains tax 
which he was liable to pay.  He did this over a 3 year period. 

In the case of Gold, the figure is £1,564,931. 

In these two cases the unpaid tax was due on the proceeds of the fraud.  I will deal with this, 
therefore, as an aggravating feature of the fraud and will impose concurrent sentences but the 
sentence for the count 1 cheat will reflect the fact that tax on the benefit obtained was not paid, and 
that a sophisticated means of tax evasion was employed, as I have described above. 

In the case of Whiston-Dew, the maximum tax evaded is £2,174,330, of which the majority 
represents the benefit of the count 1 cheat, but not all.  I cannot measure the actual tax lost because 
of the outrageous way in which Whiston-Dew operated his business.  He produced no accounts.  He 
said in his evidence that his accountant had failed him and had thrown away his books and records 
because they were too bulky to keep.  This absurd evidence was plainly rejected by the jury.  It is 
true that by the time he was charged with cheat in relation to the profits of his business the period 
when he was required to keep records for tax purposes had elapsed by a short period, but he did not 
say that he had thrown away his books and records for this reason.  His evidence was that many of 
the payments into his business account were capital items, loans or money being held for others.  In 
many cases the transactions were still current in that loans have not yet been repaid.  He would 
need records of these simply to ensure that they were ultimately repaid to the right lender or 
recovered from the borrower.  I infer from his failure to keep or produce records that they would
--------
show things which he has calculated that he cannot afford to reveal even at the cost of rendering his 
sworn evidence at this trial utterly implausible. 

I can only deal with him on the basis that I do not know how much tax he has evaded on his business 
activities which do not relate to the count 1 cheat, but that it is a significant sum.  He estimated it at 
the tax payable on a profit of £73,000 but that evidence is no more credible than anything else he 
said.  He did not trouble to explain how he had arrived at this figure or produce any supporting 
evidence.  Because I am sure that a significant amount of tax has been evaded under this heading 
not associated with the fraud, I shall impose a concurrent sentence in relation to count 4, but will 
adjust the sentence on count 1 to reflect the overall criminality disclosed by these convictions. 

FINDINGS ABOUT ROLES OF OFFENDERS 

MICHAEL RICHARDS AND ROBERT GOLD 

Michael Richards and Robert Gold between them devised and ran the fraud. 

It is unnecessary to describe the role of Richards in detail.  He was closely involved in every aspect of 
the design and implementation of the scheme and in the extensive efforts to keep its true nature 
hidden.    He described himself as the ringmaster and accepted responsibility for the whole thing, 
arguing that it was honest and legitimate.  Richards devised it and Gold and he together ran it.  
Richards was also involved in marketing it and told lies to investors and their advisers in the course 
of that.   

The lies told by Richards to potential investors about the BAPO were absolutely brazen.  His 
attempts to explain them away in the witness box demonstrated that his dishonesty runs very deep 
and he believes that he has the ability to make anyone believe anything, a fraudster to his core. 

Robert Gold had no involvement with investors.  However, he did have a major role in recruiting the 
core team and in making available a key instrument of the fraud namely the Growth Fund 
Partnership.  That was central to the claims made in the first 12 months of the fraud that land was 
available in Brazil so that the LLPs paid for land options which they never got (they got pieces of 
paper but no land).  It was also central to the BAPO which the investors were told was cash 
collateralised which meant that the scheme was supported by a company which could afford to 
lodge £204m in cash with Barclays Isle of Man for up to 15 years.  This was complete fiction, 
dishonestly created and maintained until 30th August 2006 when the diligence of Mr. Pirouet and 
Mrs Cazalet (auditors of the LLPs at Tenon) rooted out the truth.  She had done quite brief checks on 
the accounts of GFP and correctly determined that it was worth very little, if anything at all.  Robert 
Gold and Michael Richards had been closely involved with Mr. Birnholz  since the share swap the 
effect of which was to make their company Landcom look as if it was worth £386m more than it was 
to anyone looking at its accounts.  That was based on the fraudulent accounts of Growth Fund 
Partnership for the year ended 31st December 2002. 

Robert Gold was, no doubt, a busy man not entirely engaged on this fraud.  His emails are short and 
to the point, but always about some very important aspect of the scheme and they were instructions 
to others about what to do.  He was in control, as the “Straw Man” emails between Warwick Smith 
and Jon Anwyl clearly confirm.  He knew that the common control of EGC and CPTL and also of the 
manager of the LLPS, Carbon Capital Limited, had been dishonestly suppressed and hidden from all 
the advisers to the scheme, and that it was crucial to the advice they gave. 

Richards and Gold established their offshore trusts on the same day in May 2005, just after they had 
persuaded the corporate directors of EGC, Trident Trust, to release the first tranche of funds it had
--------
received from CPTL so that the circle could start.  Gold was not at the meeting, but Richards, 
Warwick Smith and Whiston-Dew were and they represented the conspiracy and achieved this 
common aim.  Swiss Bank accounts were then set up, but new ones were required at a different 
bank and this delayed the share out of the first tranche of investors’ funds to the conspirators until 
November 2005.  The Swiss Banks were told to “hold all mail” so that there would be no trace of 
these accounts on any document which might be recovered in the United Kingdom.  This fraudulent 
system was operated with discipline by Richards, Whiston-Dew and Warwick Smith because no trace 
of any of those accounts or trusts was found on the searches.  Mr. Gold had made a significant 
mistake by having two odd pages in his house which did provide a lead for HMRC which ultimately 
formed part of the chain by which these funds and fraudulent devices were discovered in late 2009. 

There is no doubt that both Gold and Richards played a leading role in this conspiracy and benefited 
very substantially from it.  Richards was responsible for making the early payments to Demetriou via 
his trust, and if his share of the proceeds is reduced to reflect that, then it becomes broadly 
comparable with that of Robert Gold.  Richards, nevertheless, did extract more than Gold did by the 
time of the arrests in July 2007.  Nevertheless, I consider that they were equal partners and both 
have benefited very substantially.  I will treat them equally. 

Their level of culpability is very high and the level of sophistication and planning also very high.  They 
both had leading roles, and used their influence to recruit and corrupt others. 

RODNEY WHISTON-DEW  

Mr. Whiston-Dew is a solicitor of considerable experience.  He was used as general counsel to the 
scheme, in particular to deal with the parts which were too dishonest to be shown to any honest 
solicitor.  He was the man who owned and controlled EGC, as far as its corporate directors were 
concerned, although he manipulated them and that company for the purposes of the conspiracy.  He 
created 10 “cash confirmations” by which he misled the readers into believing that the Growth Fund 
Partnership had paid cash to Barclays Bank Isle of Man where it was held as security for the BAPO. 

The Trident Trust directors at the early stage do not emerge from this case with a great deal of 
credit.  I do not understand why they released the funds after the meeting of 18th May 2005 on the 
basis of oral assertions unsupported by documents that CPTL was owned by Richards and Gold, 
especially when Gold was not at the meeting.  They took a proper line in the letter of 9th May 2005 
from Mr. Edwards and then caved in.  I do not accept either that Mr. Coates was unaware until much 
later than Tenon were asking what cash was held by EGC under the terms of the BAPO.  The email in 
which he claims not have understood the very direct questions which Tenon were asking, and which 
he answered in the precise terms demanded by Mr. Whiston-Dew on 29th June, were clear enough.  
Mr. Read emerges with credit, because he knew nothing about the case at all when he attended the 
meeting of 18th May and reacted with obvious probity to the Tenon requests for information in 
Summer 2006.  In the end, I accept that Trident Trust did behave appropriately, but they allowed 
Whiston-Dew far too much leeway in 2005 and did his bidding too readily when he bullied and 
threatened them.  This does not lessen his guilt, and illustrates the importance of his role in enabling 
the scheme to be perpetrated.  Although he did not corrupt them, he did procure their compliance 
without which the scheme could not have operated as it did. 

He provided the advice which led to the formation and abuse of the offshore companies and trusts 
and the contact with Rudolf Imringer and Jacques Delacave who were happy to accept fees to be 
named as trustees to give an appearance of substance to the trusts which were actually entirely 
operated by Whiston-Dew for the personal benefit of his fellow conspirators.
--------
He drafted resolutions for companies which were needed to implement the conspiracy, and also 
helped in drafting the BAPO (2nd version) and the Line of Credit documents. 

His culpability is high and he had a very important role in the fraud, but was not its controller.  He 
was 1 rung down from Richards and Gold, and ranked somewhat below Warwick Smith. 

EVDOROS DEMETRIOU 

Demetriou was there at the start and received money from Richards in the first distribution of at 
least £1m.  He later received much larger sums and actually is shown as having received the highest 
amount of money of all defendants although he may have been holding some of that to shield it for 
his accomplices.  He is an accomplished launderer of money and helped Gold in that capacity after 
the arrests in July 2007 when the property at Canfield gardens was sold and the proceeds remitted 
through yet another dishonest offshore trust so that they could fund the purchase of a house in 
Dubai. 

He asked Anwyl to lie about the ownership of CPTL in an email, and told numerous lies about this 
subject.  He put himself forward as the owner and controller of CPTL when that fiction was required 
to persuade HMRC that it was an independent company.  He was extremely well paid for doing this 
and it was a very dishonest act. 

He acted under the directions of Richards and Gold in all that he did, and this follows from the fact 
that his claim to be a controller of CPTL was in fact false.  His true rank was lower than he 
dishonestly claimed. 

His role was a significant one where the offending is part of a group activity.  The real aggravating 
feature in his case is that vast amount of money he received and the period over which he sustained 
his dishonesty.   I accept the submission that his culpability is at level B in the relevant guideline, but 
the offence is a serious one within the range covered by that category. 

JON ANWYL 

Jon Anwyl, as I have said, was drawn into this by others.  He was first attracted by a genuine 
motivation to work on a project which had a genuine ethical basis.  He rapidly learnt enough to know 
that it was based on fraud and he was required to go through the charade of pretending to negotiate 
the Scientific Research Agreements which were in fact presented to him by Richards.  He produced a 
spreadsheet (Appendix A) which pretended to justify the figure he had been told to put in the 
agreement and this spreadsheet dishonestly told the reader that some real work had been done to 
try to calculate a price for work which Anwyl had no idea how to do, let alone how to price.  It was 
all going to be sub-contracted but no-one had identified the sub-contractor, or the land where the 
work was to be done, and obtained a quote for the work.  Appendix A was based entirely on 
speculation and guesswork and designed to justify the price which had been fixed so that the fraud 
would work and which bore no relation to what was actually going to be spent. 

Anwyl also lent himself to the task of lying to persuade HMRC that he and Demetrios owned and 
controlled CPTL whereas it was in fact Richards, Gold, Whiston-Dew and Warwick Smith. 

He did this in return for a large sum of money in addition to his salary.  His wife wrote him a letter in 
2008 which made it clear that he was working very hard on the scheme and also that she was deeply 
concerned that it was a dishonest scheme and very worried about how, if ever, they could extricate 
themselves from the consequences of that.  That was a moving, perceptive and, I think, accurate 
assessment of the position.
--------
A decent young man who was corrupted by others and by the lure of very large amounts of money. 

His culpability is in the level B range of the relevant Guideline because he played a significant role 
but acted under direction.  It emerged in the evidence that although on the surface it appeared that 
he must have controlled the movement of the money through CPTL, in fact Warwick Smith was the 
key figure in doing that.  Nevertheless, he knew the key fact in the case which was the amount of 
money which appeared to have been spent on Research and Development and the actual amount 
which was made available to him for that purpose.  He had £16m out of an apparent sum of £269m, 
and he knew it. 

WAS THE FRAUD HONEST AT THE START? 

MITIGATION: COMMON POINTS 

No.  At the start it was hoped that a tax incentivised scheme could be devised which would not be a 
cheat on HMRC, but it would still be dishonest because the fact of common control was always going 
to be hidden.  That is why lies were told to Mr. Sayer and Mr. Thornhill and why the banks which 
were approached were not told who owned EGC.  If the common control were publicly known, no-
one would invest in the scheme without very thorough enquiry and it would be far harder for the 
conspirators to help themselves to the money provided by the investors.  If a bank had been 
persuaded to fund the scheme it would not have been a cheat on HMRC, but it would still have 
covertly benefited its orchestrators.  They are not to be sentenced for offences which this would 
have involved, but it would strain the language to describe this project as having ever been honest.  
This does not aggravate the position but it does mean that this mitigating factor is not available to 
Richards, Gold and Whiston-Dew.  Anwyl and Demetriou became complicit at a later time and can 
say that they joined what they thought was an honest scheme. 

DELAY 

The guideline allows that the lapse of time since apprehension where this does not arise from the 
conduct of the offender is a mitigating factor.  The time taken to investigate and charge these 
defendants was entirely due to the sophistication and complexity of the fraud which understandably 
took a very long time to unravel.  That was precisely why they used offshore companies, trusts and 
banks and they cannot complain about the consequences of that. 

Having been charged the proceedings then took about 7 years to come on for trial.  This was undue 
delay, as I have found in the context of an application for a restraint order in the cases of Richards 
and Whiston-Dew.  By “undue”, I meant that the proceedings have taken far longer than they should 
have done, even though it is well known that these cases all do take a long time and do involve 
delays.  This was at least in part because of submissions made to the previous trial judge about the 
disclosure process which the prosecution largely conceded and which he accepted.  They were both 
wrong to do so.  In my judgment the conduct of the defendants did materially contribute to this 
delay.  By that I do not mean that they did anything improper, merely that the way in which they 
chose to conduct the proceedings did result in a very long pre-trial period.  Despite this obvious 
truth, I consider nevertheless that their Convention right to trial within a reasonable period of time 
was infringed to an extent and the sentence should make a modest allowance to reflect that. 

The particular factor which leads me to this conclusion is that there is an element of mitigation to be 
derived from the fact that these proceedings were stayed by a High Court Judge in May 2015 and the 
defendants then believed that they were at an end.  It was not so long before they were resurrected
--------
by the Court of Appeal (December 2015) but I consider that this aspect of the delay does need to be 
reflected in sentence. 

In recent similar case the Court of Appeal Criminal Division on a reference by the Attorney General 
made deductions of about 20% for delay and other associated mitigation.  I shall adopt a similar 
approach.  This more than adequately addresses the individual adverse impacts which the delay has 
caused to individual defendants, which I have well in mind.  I also have in mind the impact on the 
innocent and vulnerable people whose lives have been shattered by the conduct of those they have 
trusted and loved: Gold’s children, Mrs. Demetriou, and Anwyl’s child and mother.  The discount 
includes a number of items of mitigation, some of which I deal with below, as it did in that earlier 
case. 

INDIVIDUAL MITIGATION 

All defendants are entitled to rely on their lack of previous convictions and on the evidence of good 
character adduced before the jury and since.  They are all entitled to the benefit of previous 
exemplary conduct.  This includes charitable work, as explained in the character evidence.  The 20% 
discount for delay and personal mitigation in the recent Court of Appeal case included this item of 
mitigation, but I am particularly impressed by the character evidence I have heard and read in this 
case and will give it some additional weight. 

Richards, Whiston-Dew and Demetriou have evidenced medical conditions which require long term 
treatment.  Whiston-Dew has type 2 diabetes and Demetriou is 78.  Both facts affect the length of 
time they have to live.  These facts are relevant within the Guideline, but are of modest weight in 
view of the modern approach to sentencing offenders who are much older than they are. 

The prison sentences which must follow will affect the Gold children, Anwyl’s child and his mother.  
Demetriou is the sole or primary carer for his wife who is elderly and very dependent on him.  I 
accept that he feels profoundly guilty about what he has done to her. 

I have already explained my approach to Anwyl as the least experienced and most naïve of the 
defendants who was ruthlessly used and has been ruined by his involvement.  None of the others 
has that mitigation.  They were worldly-wise men who knew exactly what they were doing and all 
had the capacity to make good livings without fraud.  They were just very greedy.  Life had given 
them opportunities denied to others and they used the reputation they had earned to con others 
and to perpetrate fraud. 

In the recent case in the Court of Appeal to which I have already referred the fraud involved £60m of 
tax at risk and was therefore a much smaller fraud.  There were no personal tax counts and the level 
of benefit to the conspirators is not clear from the report.  In those respects it was significantly less 
serious than the present case.  Nothing at all was ever done by way of work abroad whereas here an 
underfunded unskilled and unsuccessful effort was made to achieve something.  That factor is a 
slight distinction in favour of these defendants.  Overall, this is significantly worse case. 

SENTENCE 

In the case of Richards and Gold this is a category 1A case with a starting point based on £80m loss 
of 12 years.  The loss here is £107m of intended, not actual loss.  The starting point needs to be 
increased to reflect this, and also the other seriously aggravating features I have already identified.  I 
consider that a starting point in their cases of 14 years is appropriate.  I make reductions from that 
for the factors I have identified and the sentence on count 1 is 11 years. The personal tax counts are 
high culpability offences and the level of harm indicates different outcomes as between Richards
--------
and Gold.  There will be concurrent terms of 7 years in the case of Richards and 6 years in the case of 
Gold.  They will be disqualified from acting as a company director under the Company Directors 
(Disqualification) Act 1986 for 10 years because of the cynical manipulation of offshore limited 
liability companies. 

Rodney Whiston-Dew starting point is somewhat less for the reasons I have given at 13 years, taking 
into account my rather different approach to his personal tax count which includes money outwith 
the scope of count 1.   Applying a very similar discount in his case the sentence in his case is 10 years 
with a concurrent term of 7 years for count 4.  He will also be disqualified under the 1986 Act for a 
period of 10 years.  His role in the conspiracy directly involved the abuse of limited liability 
companies. 

Evdoros Demetriou is in a lower category of culpability but elevated within that category because of 
the amount of money he received and because of his perversion of the course of justice.  His starting 
point is 8½  years, and applying a discount for personal mitigation the sentence in his case is 6 years.  
I feel deeply sorry for his wife, but given that other arrangements for her care for a significant period 
of time will inevitably be required in any event, I cannot make more of an adjustment on her 
account than I have.  The discount for mitigation in his case is somewhat higher than in other cases 
because of her.  Given his role in the conspiracy he also will be disqualified under the 1986 Act for 10 
years. 

Jonathan Anwyl is also in the same category of culpability, category B.  For the reasons I have 
explained his offence is not aggravated in the same way as that of the other defendants.  His starting 
point is 7 years and the sentence in his case is 5½ years.  I consider that the risk of his re-offending is 
low and that there is no need for a disqualification order in his case. 

CONFISCATION AND ALL OTHER FINANCIAL ORDERS ADJOURNED.  TIMETABLE SET. 

THERE ARE NO QUALIFYING CURFEWS. 

THE AGE OF THE OFFENCE MEANS THAT NO VICTIM SURCHARGE APPLIES. 

IN THE ABSENCE OF THE DEFENDANTS 

On Wednesday of this week after I had discharged the jury, I thanked them on behalf of the court 
and the public for their service in this case.  I wish to repeat what I said in this rather fuller 
courtroom where the press are here to represent the public. 

This jury served from mid-January to mid-early November 2017.  They did so diligently, courteously 
and with very obvious attention to the long and complex evidence they were required to hear.  This 
was an enormous burden imposed on them by the luck of the ballot.  They did their duty without 
complaint and took it seriously. 

At the end, they retired on 16th October and returned verdicts this week after long and careful 
deliberations.  Some people think that juries cannot try complex fraud cases.  I wish those people 
had been here to see this jury at work.   

The observations I make are not comments on the verdicts: I would have said this whatever verdicts 
had been returned.  The job of taking important decisions about other people is not easy, and not 
always agreeable.  This jury did that job, and took those decisions.  I said to them on Wednesday 
that they should be proud of the way they have done their work, and that the public of this country 
should be, and are, very grateful to them.
--------
I discharged them from jury service in the future so that if they are ever summoned again, it will be 
their choice whether they serve or not. 

An event took place in this trial which is unprecedented in my experience.  A juror found early in the 
trial that she was pregnant and her child was born about 1 month early, while the jury was in 
retirement.  I discharged her from further service so that she could be with her child, and she 
expressed frustration (through her delight) that she could not see her job here through.  This 
attitude typified that of the whole jury.  Another was told that she could go on holiday on 6th 
November long ago when we thought it would be over by then, and she made arrangements 
accordingly.  She volunteered, without any request from me, to change that when it became clear 
that the jury would not be finished by that date. 

The trial itself has taken a very long time and there are multiple lessons to be learnt from it.  One 
thing I wish to say is that the use of iPads (or other tablet devices) was used in this trial very 
successfully.  Each juror had an iPad on which the whole of the evidence was available through 
chronological schedules of events which contained links.  They also had the legal directions, the 
Indictment, the admissions and everything else they required.  They could annotate these, highlight 
them and so on.  The support we received from the contractor was admirable. I am very grateful to 
the team for all that they have done.  The jury very quickly learned how to operate their iPads and 
were able to access them in retirement.  They had almost no paper at all. 

We also benefited from a Livenote instant transcript which was, again, also provided with great 
efficiency, courtesy and with a really constructive approach to the proceedings. 

I would like to thank all counsel and the other members of the legal teams for their assistance 
throughout the time when I have been associated with the case. 

I wish to commend formally Mr. Paul Maybury and the whole HMRC team which has supported the 
case during this trial and also Ms. Hilary Gladding whose civil enquiry set the ball rolling in 2005 
when she rightly suspected what was happening.  Events proved her right.  Although in some 
respects the history of this trial has not always reflected well on the way in which it was conducted, 
the individuals concerned have rendered real public service and deserve the commendation. 

Finally, I would like to thank all the staff here at this court, in particular Paul Carter, the court 
associate, Mark Hyde, the usher, Debbie Clarke who was the jury manager, and Sharon Bell who 
succeeded her during the trial.  Their expert management of the jury’s administrative needs 
contributed greatly to the fact that, but for the early arrival of Evie, we would have ended this case 
with a jury of 12 people.  This is highly unusual in a case as long as this and a great tribute to their 
work.",2017-11-10 00:00:00,UK Crown Court
6453909,Safe Work NSW v Ceerose Pty Ltd [2017] NSWDC 313,"sentence


	
	Ceerose Pty Ltd (the offender) has pleaded guilty to an offence that being a person who had a health and safety duty pursuant to section 19(2) Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (the Act), it failed to comply with that duty and thereby exposed Jennifer Lipperts to a risk of death or serious injury contrary to section 32 of the Act.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the offence is a fine of $1.5 million.
	


Facts


	
	The parties presented an Agreed Statement of Facts that can be summarised as follows.
	
	
	The offender operated a construction management business and was the principal contractor for construction work (the work) on a site situated on the corner of Barr Street and Pyrmont Bridge Road, Camperdown (Barr Street site). The offender was also contracted to undertake remediation work on a site situated at 19-25 Lyons Road Camperdown (Lyons Road site).
	
	
	In about August 2014 the offender took control of the Barr Street site and only had access to the Lyons road site for parking until it took full control of the Lyons Road site in late February 2015.
	
	
	The Lyons Road site had been used by previous tenants for parking and storage and was secured with an electric gate. This gate was manufactured in such a way that the left-hand section would slide back and forth along a rail; whilst the right-hand side would swing open and shut on a hinge. Each of the tenants accessed the site via remote control, opening and closing the sliding gate. The Lyons Road site sloped downwards slightly, leading to the sliding gate have to close on a slope.
	
	
	The dimensions of the sliding gate were approximately 5800mm in length, 2000mm in height and 50mm in thickness. The sliding gate was manufactured from thick tubular steel.
	
	
	The sliding gate was capable of being operated both electronically and manually. Power to the Lyons Road site was disconnected on 21 March 2015. It was a standard automatic sliding gate consisting of:
	



	
	A gate leaf made up of a frame and grill, a rack and wheels on the bottom frame and a guide rail attached to the top of the frame, running its length;
	
	
	A support post, positioned at the left-hand side of the Lyons Road site which supported the gate via a guide bracket attached to the support post that came into contact with the guide rail
	
	
	A guide rail, that was a 90 degree angled steel bar that was welded horizontally to the top frame of the sliding gate
	
	
	A metal stopper welded to the end of the guide rail
	
	
	A track under the bottom of the frame that the wheels would move along
	
	
	A rack at the base of the gate leaf which was a geared toothed track positioned upside down and horizontal
	
	
	An electric motor with a cog drive.
	



	
	The sliding gate was designed to operate with the wheels mounting the track and rolling back and forth. The rack along the length of the gate coupled with the electric powered cog which moved the gate along the track as it turned. The guide bracket connected the gate to the support post to keep it upright and stable. The guide bracket also kept the gate the appropriate distance from the support post. The metal stopper welded to the guide rail would collide with the support post when the gate was closed, preventing it from running off the track or past the support post.
	
	
	From about August 2014 the offender used the Lyon Street site as a car park and access point for delivery vehicles and truck washing. When not in use, the gates were closed and padlocked. A supervisor was usually required to open the gate for access and then lock it. Two supervisors had the key to the site, one being Mr Nakhoul. Other people, not related to the offender’s business also had access to the site up to 12 January 2015.
	
	
	At the time the offender took full control of the Lyons Road site in February 2015, the gate was still operated electronically. An identified risk of a brick wall collapsing onto a public footpath led to the offender disconnecting the power from the site on 21 March 2015. The gate had to be manually opened and closed after this time.
	
	
	TS Media Pty Ltd, trading as Labour King (Labour King) was contracted by the offender to provide personnel to undertake traffic control duties at both sites. Ms Lipperts was employed by Labour King. Ms Lipperts is a German national. At the time of the incident she was in Australia on a working visa. She had obtained qualifications in traffic management and the application traffic control plans from the Roads and Maritime Services on 10 and 11 November 2014.
	
	
	She worked as a traffic controller under the direction and control of the offender at both sites in February 2015. Ms Lipperts reported to Mr Nakhoul, project co-ordinator and Mr Walker, site manager with the offender. Roy Massoud was the site manager for the Barr Street site, but only attended that location on a weekly basis as he worked out of head office.
	
	
	At approximately 4:15pm on 14 May 2015 the victim was working as a traffic controller at the Lyons Road site. She had been given the key to the padlock earlier that day and was asked to lock the gate when the trucks left by an identified supervisor. The victim had done this previously during busy periods.
	
	
	Previously the victim had only been required to open and close the sliding gate only as the swing gate was already closed. When she first began working at the site, the gate was easy to open and close but after some time it became harder to move. At times, the victim would attempt to put her entire weight behind the gate to move it, with little success.
	
	
	On the date of the incident both gates were open. When the victim began to close the sliding gate it dislodged from the track and fell, landing on her. The victim sustained numerous fractures to her pelvis, fractures to her sacrum and a wedge compression fracture of the T11 vertebrae in her thoracic spine.
	
	
	The victim spent 3 months receiving treatment for her injuries in Australia before returning to Germany. Although improved somewhat, she continues to experience pain and discomfort from her injuries. She cannot lift heavy objects, has stopped physiotherapy treatment on advice from her doctors but continues to go to the gym.
	
	
	An inspection of the gate after the incident revealed the following:
	



	
	The slider block was missing
	
	
	The sliding gate could be moved from side-to-side between the support post and external fencing whilst engaged on the track
	
	
	When resting against the external fence post, the sliding gate was too far from the support post, rendering the stopper inactive if the gate was in the closed position
	
	
	There was damage to the mid-rail and top-rail of the gate
	
	
	As the slider block was missing, the gap between the gate and support post could extend past the length of the metal stopper, meaning that the stopper would not impact with the support post, enabling the gate to go beyond its intended position.
	



	
	Prior to the incident the gate was operated electronically, until the offender made the decision to disconnect the power to the site. The victim had not been properly instructed in the correct method of manually opening the gate. She had informed Mr Nakhoul at some time between February 2015 and the date of the incident that she was having increasing difficulty in opening the gate. No written complaint was made by either the victim or Mr Nakhoul to the offender regarding this issue.
	
	
	The offender did not conduct a proper risk assessment after the power was disconnected and the gate had to be operated manually. No records of inspection, either visually or otherwise were produced by the offender pertaining to the gates’ operation.
	
	
	Immediately after the incident the gate was locked and not used. Subsequently, the gate was removed and temporary cyclone fencing was installed at the site. The Lyons Road site remained empty until commencement of the intended remediation works.
	


The Offender’s Case on Sentence


	
	The offender relied on an affidavit of Roy Massoud, the Construction Manager the offender, sworn 23 October 2017. Mr Massoud was present in Court for the sentence hearing and was not required for cross-examination. Mr Massoud’s evidence can be summarised as follows.
	
	
	Mr Massoud commenced work for the offender on 11 October 2010. He was appointed the Construction Manager and a member of the senior management team in February 2015. He has a supervisory role for all of the offender’s construction work and projects. Mr Massoud holds tertiary qualifications in Construction Management and has had over 13 years’ experience in construction, project design, planning and management.
	
	
	The offender was the principal contractor for construction work at the site. It took control of the site in about August 2014 for the purpose of constructing an apartment complex.
	
	
	Mr Massoud deposed that the offender acknowledged its safety systems in relation to the gates were inadequate and failed to prevent the incident. The reasonably practicable measures had not been taken. The offender acknowledged the pain and suffering to Ms Lipperts and expressed remorse for her injury and ongoing disabilities.
	
	
	The Lyons Road site where Ms Lipperts was working was being remediated for use as a public park. Whilst the apartments were being constructed the site was being used for parking, washing trucks and storage of materials.
	
	
	In about late February 2015 the offender identified that a high brick wall on the Lyons Road site was at risk of collapsing. The offender engaged engineers who advised that the wall needed to be demolished. The power supply for the Lyons Road site ran through the wall so it was disconnected on 21 March 2015 prior to the demolition.
	
	
	The gate was thereafter only able to be opened manually. After the incident the gate was put back into place and secured so that it could not be used.
	
	
	Ms Lipperts was visited in hospital and contacted by a number of the offender’s staff. The offender paid Ms Lipperts the shortfall between her normal wages and her compensation payments.
	
	
	The offender had a comprehensive work health and safety (WHS) system in place at the time of the incident. In 2013 it had been audited by an external provider and the suggested amendments to it were implemented by the offender. On 27 April 2015 the offender had an external provider deliver a seminar to its staff relating to the incident.
	
	
	Since 2013 the offender’s sites have been controlled by a Site Manager and a Site Foreman, as well as other supervisory staff depending on the size of the project. The Site Manager is required to conduct at least weekly site inspections.
	
	
	Weekly toolbox talks involving all staff and contractors are held on site in busy periods of construction and fortnightly tool box talks are held at other times. Site supervisors hold a weekly meeting at which WHS issues can also be discussed. The wearing of personal protection equipment (PPE) on site is strictly enforced.
	
	
	At the time of the incident the offender had 7 experienced supervisors for the project. The offender had also engaged an external provider to conduct fortnightly inspections of the site.
	
	
	No risk assessment or inspection of the gate was ever conducted after the power was disconnected. Ms Lipperts was not instructed on the correct method of operation of the gate after the power was disconnected and there was no assessment made of her physical capacity to undertake that task.
	
	
	Ms Lipperts had otherwise been inducted and trained in accordance with the offender’s WHS plan for the site. The WHS system did not identify the risk posed by the gate.
	
	
	After the incident the offender has ensured stricter compliance with the WHS policies and sought to continually review and improve the procedures in place. The offender has employed a WHS Quality and Environmental Manager and engaged a new external provider to undertake safety audits.
	
	
	On 8 March 2016 the offenders WHS management system obtained Australian Standard compliance. In June 2016 the newly appointed WHS Quality and Environmental Manager reviewed and revised the WHS system to take into account that new role, including weekly site safety visits. WHS objectives are reviewed by management on a monthly basis taking into account the work in the past month and the work to be completed in the following month.
	
	
	Between 2014 and 2016 the offender spent $235,310 on worker safety and management systems. The offender spent $60,600 on external safety audit reports for the project.
	
	
	The offender is a member of various industry bodies. The offender has also contributed to community and charity organisations, contributing around $70,000 to those bodies since 2010.
	


Consideration


	
	I have had regard to the objects of the Act set out in section 3 and the purposes of sentencing set out in section 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	


Objective Seriousness


	
	The crush risk posed by the gate was obvious. The sliding gate was 5.8m long by 2m high and constructed to thick tubular steel. It closed on a downward slope. There was nothing to stop it sliding past the track provided for it and nothing to attach it to the post, so that when it was slid too far it was likely to fall. A cursory examination of the gate would have identified the issues. An inspection should have been undertaken at the time that the power was cut to determine if it was safe for Ms Lipperts to operate the gate manually. No inspection was undertaken after Ms Lipperts complained to Mr Nakhoul that the gate was becoming difficult to operate.
	
	
	The likelihood of the risk coming home were moderate to high. The gate was operated manually from 21 March 2015 and the incident occurred on 14 May 2015. The gate was opened and closed a number of times a day and had become more difficult to operate, requiring the application of additional force by Ms Lipperts.
	
	
	The steps that could have been taken were simple and inexpensive. All that was required was a visual inspection and the refitting of the slider block, which could have been done by the offender at little, if any cost.
	
	
	The risk was one of serious injury.
	
	
	The injuries sustained by Mr Lipperts were significant. She suffered 3 pelvic fractures, 2 of which were displaced, a complex fracture of her right sacrum and a wedge fracture at T11 in her thoracic spine. She was hospitalised for about 4 weeks. She suffered pain and complications including a bladder infection. She was required to undergo physiotherapy and hydrotherapy for a number of months. She is still experiencing pain 2.5 years later and she is understandably concerned about the impact her injuries may have on childbirth. She continues to have difficulties with mobility and getting comfortable, when sitting and lying down. She cannot carry anything heavy. She was very active young person before the accident and has been unable to return to many sporting and leisure activities. Ms Lipperts is presently 25 years of age.
	


Deterrence


	
	The penalty imposed in relation to this offence must provide for general deterrence. Employers must take the obligations imposed by the Act very seriously. The community is entitled to expect that both small and large employers will comply with safety requirements. General deterrence is a significant factor when safety obligations are breached: Bulga Underground Operations Pty Ltd v Nash [2016] NSWCCA 37 at [180].
	
	
	There is also a need for specific deterrence because the offender continues to operate in an industry that presents significant risks to the health and safety of its employees. The offender has 2 previous convictions for occupational health and safety breaches. In an incident in June 2008 a worker fell from height suffering severe leg injuries. On 13 April 2013 a worker was killed when a skylight fell from a crane at one of the offender’s sites. The penalty imposed for this offence needs to bring home to the offender that if it continues to breach its safety obligations that it will meet with condign punishment. I have taken into account that the offender has made further adjustments to its safety systems as a result of the incident.
	


Aggravating factors


	
	The offender has a record of previous convictions: 21A(2)(d) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Multiple convictions for offences of this type are rare for a PCBU. This offender has 2 previous matters, one resulting in serious injury and the other resulting in the death of a worker. Prior convictions are pertinent to deciding where, within the boundaries set by the objective circumstances are set, a sentence should lie: R v McNaughton (2006) 66 NSWLR 566 at [26]. Prior convictions should not be taken into account in such a way to punish the offender again for those earlier matters, but they do not assist the offender in affording to it any particular leniency.
	
	
	The injury harm and loss caused by the offence was substantial: section 21A(2)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. In order for the aggravating factor to be established I must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the harm was greater or more deleterious than may ordinarily be expected for the offence in question: R v Youkhana [2004] NSWCCA 412 at [26]. The Victim Impact Statement was not objected to or called into question and in my view it is proper to take it into account in consideration of the establishment of the aggravating factor: R v Tuala [2015] NSWCCA 8. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the injury harm and loss caused by the offence was substantial.
	


Mitigating factors


	
	The offender has demonstrated remorse: section 21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The offender expressed remorse through the affidavit Mr Massoud. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offender has accepted responsibility for its actions and demonstrated genuine remorse and contrition.
	
	
	The offender entered a plea of guilty: section 21A(3)(k) and section 22 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The offender is entitled to a discount on penalty that reflects the utilitarian value of that plea. The extent of the discount should generally be assessed in the range of 10-25%, but that is only a guide. The primary consideration in determining where in the range a particular case should fall is the timing of the plea, so that the earlier the plea the greater the discount: R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 and R v Borkowski (2009) 195 A Crim R 1 at [32]. The plea also indicates remorse: Borkowski at [32]. The appropriate discount is 25%.
	
	
	The offender co-operated with the Safe Work investigation: section 21A(3)(m) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	


Penalty


	
	The offender is convicted.
	
	
	I have considered the Victim Impact Statement of Ms Lipperts.
	
	
	The appropriate fine is one of $400,000 that will be discounted by 25% to take into account the plea of guilty.
	
	
	I impose a fine of $300,000.
	
	
	I order that pursuant to section 122(2) Fines Act 1996 that 50% of the fine is to be paid to the prosecutor.

6453924,R v Gibbons [2017] NSWDC 321,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: The decision of Veen v The Queen [No 2] (1988) 164 CLR 465  tells us that, as long as a sentence is not increased beyond that which is proportional to the objective gravity of an offender’s conduct, a judge is entitled to take into account that a particular offence represents a continuing attitude of disobedience towards the law.
	
	
	That attitude has been displayed by Mr Gibbons for a number of years now. He committed a serious offence whilst on parole. It is worth examining what he was on parole for. He had been sent to prison for reasonably lengthy periods for offences of armed robbery, and he committed those offences whilst he was on seven bonds.
	
	
	He received a sentence for the armed robbery matters which the Court of Criminal Appeal found to be lenient. The Crown appeal was allowed and in the course of their judgment, the Court of Criminal Appeal did note Mr Gibbons’ continuing attitude of disobedience towards the law.
	
	
	Unfortunately, that attitude has continued. Mr Gibbons had only been out of custody on parole for about four months when he committed the offence I will now describe.
	
	
	He appears to have taken a dislike to a particular person. He went to a shopping centre. He was wearing a black hooded jumper and gloves. His manner of dress attracted the attention of a member of the public because the temperature at the time was in the high 20’s, with no wind.
	
	
	Mr Gibbons hung around. He was near an ATM. The member of the public clearly suspected that Mr Gibbons was up to no good, and he called police.
	
	
	Police arrived, watched him for a while and then approached him. They searched him and discovered that he had a knife in his possession. They also discovered a black coloured face covering with a hole in it. He told them,
	


“Look, I’ve done nothing wrong. I’m waiting for a bloke who my missus is cheating with. I thought he’d be here. Yeah, I had a knife, but he had a baseball bat last time.”


	
	Accordingly, Mr Gibbons has pleaded guilty to an offence of being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely an assault, and he asks that when I sentence him for that matter, I take into account an offence of possessing means of disguising his face with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely assault.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the substantive offence is seven years, as is the maximum penalty for the offence on the Form 1.
	
	
	Mr Gibbons pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity, and so the sentence I impose upon him will be approximately 25% less than it would otherwise have been.
	
	
	Mr Gibbons has an unfortunate background and has spent a great deal of his adult life in gaol. Indeed, he is described as institutionalised in the psychological report tendered on his behalf today.
	
	
	His life started going awry when he was about 13 years of age. He had run away from his second stepfather, who was physically abusive towards him, and moved in with his first stepfather, his mother having passed away when Mr Gibbons was younger, at about nine years of age.
	
	
	Mr Gibbons’ first stepfather, the man he was living with when he was about 13, was a shift worker, and so Mr Gibbons was effectively unsupervised for large parts of his life. He told the psychologist, “I was allowed to do anything I wanted and had free rein.”
	
	
	It was at this time that he began using drugs. His home became a place for his delinquent friends to spend time, free of parental intervention, and this led to Mr Gibbons entering juvenile detention. Mr Gibbons says that if he had direction, things might have been different.
	
	
	From then on, Mr Gibbons has led a life measured out in prison sentences and court dates, until we reach today.
	
	
	The offence is no doubt a serious one. Mr Gibbons claims that he was not going to use the knife to assault the person he was waiting for, but it is not beyond the realms of possibility to think that in the heat of the moment he might have resorted to using that weapon.
	
	
	I am not surprised at all that Mr Gibbons is in some way thankful that the member of the public intervened to prevent him committing an offence which would clearly have put him in a much worse position than the position he is in today.
	
	
	Mr Gibbons is now 33 years of age, and as he recognises, getting a bit old for the life that he has been living.
	
	
	If one looks at his custodial history, one can see a number of institutional charges over the years, but none since he went into custody on 13 December 2016. There is a contrast between his behaviour in custody previously and his behaviour in custody on this occasion.
	
	
	He has done courses whilst in custody too, including courses which have enabled him to develop some empathy towards the victims of his crime.
	
	
	No-one would pretend that it is going to be easy for Mr Gibbons when he is ultimately released from gaol, but he clearly wishes to put the life that he has been leading behind him. He will need support to do so.
	
	
	Ms Fraser, who appears for Mr Gibbons today, asks me to make a finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	There are two clearly countervailing considerations here. One is, as I have just said, that Mr Gibbons does need substantial supervision whilst on parole because of the very fact that he has become institutionalised. His ability to cope with the stresses of everyday life after release from custody is severely affected by the circumstance that he has been living in custody for a great part of his adult life.
	
	
	On the other hand, his criminal history has demonstrated that he, at least in the past, has been the sort of person who commits offences despite being subject to conditional liberty. Thus, on one view, a finding of special circumstances would merely enable him to go out and commit an offence earlier than he would otherwise have done. It is a serious matter to show leniency to someone when they have in the past abused that leniency.
	
	
	Notwithstanding that consideration, without wishing to use the cliché of suggesting that Mr Gibbons is at a “crossroads”, I am prepared to give Mr Gibbons one last opportunity by making a finding of special circumstances in his favour.
	
	
	There was some discussion regarding the commencement date. Mr Gibbons was arrested on 13 December 2016 and has been serving his balance of parole for the armed robbery offences, as well as being bail refused on the offence for which I must sentence him shortly.
	
	
	It is important that I do not double count by both failing to give him credit by backdating this sentence and by also regarding the fact that he was on conditional liberty as a seriously aggravating factor.
	
	
	What I have chosen to do is to commence the sentence on 13 March 2017, which gives some partial accumulation to his time serving the balance of parole.
	
	
	I impose sentence as follows.
	
	
	I impose a non-parole period of two years to have commenced on 13 March 2017 and a head sentence of three and a half years. The non‑parole period will expire on 12 March 2019, on which day Mr Gibbons is eligible to be released to parole.

6453951,R v Baxter [2017] NSWDC 320,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: There are two particular features in the case of Jamie Baxter which point towards leniency being offered to him, but against that is the circumstance that he is being sentenced today for four very serious offences. The two particular factors suggesting leniency concern what led him to become seriously involved in drug use which then led to drug supply, are, first, the untimely death of two members of his family in short succession and secondly the fact that Mr Baxter is doing remarkably well in prison, being well respected and, apart from using a sleeping tablet on one occasion, not using any drugs.
	
	
	But he must, even despite those features, spend a significant time in custody because of what he did and what his behaviour demonstrated about his attitude towards the law. The events that I am about to describe occurred whilst Mr Baxter was on parole and, more specifically, on parole for a number of offences relating to firearms.
	
	
	The offender was part of a drug dealing network together with a man by the name of Brendan Hosking. Mr Hosking was supplying drugs to Mr Baxter who was then on-supplying the drugs to other customers. A number of telephone calls and messages were monitored by police in the relatively short period between 29 July 2016 and 9 August which revealed that the offender had received and sent a total of 4,447 SMS messages, a large number of which related to the supply of methylamphetamine and the collection of money owed for the supply of methylamphetamine. It is agreed between the parties that the offender supplied approximately 210 grams of that drug to numerous different customers in that period.
	
	
	Mr Baxter was deeply involved in the supply of drugs. In that short time he supplied a significant quantity of methylamphetamine and he must have had a significant number of customers. I should emphasise that an authority from the Court of Criminal Appeal Jadron v R [2015] NSWCCA 217 says, that I can, and the parties both ask me to, take into account all of the agreed facts when assessing the objective gravity of the offence I have just described, despite my concern that in doing so I would be breaching the rule in De Simoni v R  (1981) 147 CLR 383.
	
	
	The offender is to be sentenced for an offence of supplying an indictable quantity of methylamphetamine, carrying a maximum penalty of 15 years’ imprisonment for the offence I have just described.
	
	
	The next offence was also discovered through the use of Mr Baxter’s telephone calls and messages being intercepted. On 8 August he tried to sell a firearm to Mr Hosking. He said, “...I’m selling that bike plus I got real nice bang-bang if you want it too, bro...”. Discussions ensued between the offender and Mr Hosking - I interpose to note that one of those messages actually made reference to the fact that the offender was on parole at the time - until police detained and searched the offender and discovered a sawn-off 12-gauge shotgun. It is that firearm which the offender was attempting to supply.
	
	
	The offender has pleaded guilty to two offences arising out of that; attempting to supply a prohibited firearm, carrying a maximum penalty of 14 years, and possessing a prohibited firearm also carrying a maximum penalty of 14 years, but this carrying a standard non-parole period of four years. There is, substantial overlap between the two offences. It is the one firearm involved on each occasion.
	
	
	This is, of course, a particularly serious offence. A sawn-off 12-gauge shotgun has no legitimate purpose. Its only use is that such a weapon is useful in the course of criminal activity. I should mention at this stage that when I sentence the offender for the offence of possessing the unauthorised prohibited firearm he asks me to take into account two other offences on a Form 1. The first is that he did not keep that firearm safely and the second is that he possessed ammunition for that firearm without holding a licence or a permit.
	
	
	In assessing the objective gravity of the attempt supply prohibited firearm, I will take into account that it was an attempt and not a completed supply. Although the maximum penalty for an attempt is the same as the maximum penalty for a successful supply, clearly the latter is more objectively serious than the former.
	
	
	The final offence that I have to specifically sentence Mr Baxter for is another offence of supplying methylamphetamine. This related to the comparatively small, but nevertheless significant, amount of 22 gram of methylamphetamine which was found in the offender’s bedroom when they searched it. By his plea he admits that those drugs were in his possession for the purposes of supplying them.
	
	
	So we have an offender who was deeply involved in the supply of prohibited drugs and who, whilst on parole for firearms offences, committed another firearms offence. Indeed, this is the third set of offences committed by the offender involving firearms. At least at the time he committed these offences he was demonstrating a continuing attitude of disobedience towards the law.
	
	
	It is a seriously aggravating feature that the offender was on parole, as I have mentioned even referring to that in the course of an SMS message, at the time he committed this offence, but in order not to double count, I will commence the sentence that I will eventually announced on the offender from 9 August 2016 despite the fact that he has been serving the balance of parole of an earlier sentence at least for some part of the time since then.
	
	
	Although Mr Baxter’s parents separated when he was quite young, he was raised in an otherwise supportive environment. He has had regular contact with his birth father and he told a psychiatrist that his mother, step-father and birth father are the best of friends, with his birth father visiting him in prison twice a month.
	
	
	Although he was using drugs before his brother died, his drug use escalated dramatically after his brother died in 2011 and his sister died relatively shortly thereafter. It is commonplace to learn that a person who begins to use drugs begins associating with other criminals and that together they become involved in very serious offending. That is the case here.
	
	
	Mr Baxter recognises that he needs to, himself, do something about his life if he wants to avoid being the sort of person he must see in gaol on a regular basis, a person who has spent most of their adult lives in gaol. He has done things to better himself whilst in custody. He recognises that on his release from custody he has to avoid hanging around with the wrong crowd.
	
	
	He has prospects for his future upon his release from custody. Evidence suggests that he is working in prison and has been able to do that since his incarceration through his honesty and hard work ethic. It appears that he has gained the respect of both officers and inmates at Cessnock Gaol.
	
	
	He expressed his remorse while giving evidence today, saying that he deeply regretted all his actions. He has done other things as well to demonstrate remorse. I discussed those with Mr Hanlon, who appears for the offender, in the course of submissions.
	
	
	He is currently serving his sentence on protection as a result of receiving a threat of violence from another inmate. I will take into account that circumstance as well as the risk that he will serve the entirety of his sentence on protection and the associated risk that that will involve harsher conditions of custody than would otherwise have been the case.
	
	
	Consistent with his expressions of remorse, he pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and so the sentence I impose upon him will be approximately 25 per cent less than it would otherwise have been. I have taken into account the maximum penalties and, where appropriate, the standard non-parole period for these offences. My reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period on the possess prohibited firearm matter appear in these remarks on sentence.
	
	
	I note that he has family in support of him today including his partner, with whom he has a young child. That is another factor which suggests that there are prospects for the future and that there is hope, especially with some assistance, that Mr Baxter will no longer mix with the wrong crowd and will put his offending days behind him. If he is able to do that, he will have a happier life and if he is able to do that, he will not cause harm to members of the community in the future.
	
	
	For this reason I have decided to make a modest finding of special circumstances in the offender’s favour, not as a favour to him, but because I want to do as much as I can to ensure that he does not commit offences in the future. If he is able to change his life around, then the community benefits, not just Mr Baxter.
	
	
	I will impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment. Were I not to have done so, I would have imposed the following sentences. For the offence of supplying methylamphetamine, that relating to the approximately 210 grams of methylamphetamine, a sentence of six years’ imprisonment. For the offence of attempting to supply a prohibited firearm, a sentence of imprisonment of six years. For the offence of supplying methylamphetamine, that relating to the 22 grams, a sentence of imprisonment of two years. And for the offence of possessing the shortened 12-gauge shotgun, a sentence of imprisonment of five years with a non-parole period of two and a half years.
	
	
	Instead, I impose a sentence consisting of a non-parole period of six years to date from 9 August 2016 with a head sentence of nine and a half years. The non-parole period will expire on 8 August 2022 on which day Mr Baxter is eligible to be released to parole.

6453952,R v Lodge [2017] NSWDC 319,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: With what his barrister said was “refreshing honesty”, the offender Christopher Lodge told a psychologist that at the time he committed the offence for which he must ultimately be sentenced, he had a bit of a reputation as a “mad bluer” and that he had never lost a fight. It is apparent that at the time the offence occurred Mr Lodge was somewhat proud of his reputation as an aggressive and violent person. When he was arrested for the offence I will soon describe, the police officer said to him that if he kept going the way he was going, he was “heading for gaol”. The time for him to go to gaol may well have come earlier than the police officer realised.
	
	
	The offender was in a relationship with a woman named JG. That was a brief relationship. It only existed for a period of six weeks. It terminated in part because the offender was jealous that was Ms G was seeing other people. At the time of the offence Ms G was living with another woman by the name of KF and Ms F’s three-year-old son. The offender knew that these were the living arrangements. In particular, he knew that the three-year-old son was present at Ms G’s home when, on 21 July 2016, he decided to visit, despite being clearly unwanted. There was also at that time a man by the name of JH, a friend of Ms G’s, in the home watching television.
	
	
	The offender knocked at the door. When he was asked what he was doing there, he said, “I just want my stuff.” Ms G told him that she would drop his stuff off to him the next morning and that she was not opening the door. The offender was not to be deterred. He forced the leadlight panel out of the door, causing the glass to smash. He then entered. The offender was in company with another man who no-one recognised. Ms F said, “CJ, stop it, my son is in here.” Her son was screaming. The offender apparently thought nothing of this because he continued on, preferring to keep his reputation as a violent thug rather than by doing what any decent person would do, which is to turn around and leave once the three-year-old child began screaming.
	
	
	Although the offender said that he entered only to get his stuff, as soon as he saw Mr H he started punching him. Mr H, quite reasonably, said, “Stop. What are you doing? I’ve done nothing wrong”, but the offender continued to hit Mr H, assisted by the other unknown male who had entered the premises with Mr Lodge.
	
	
	The offender made his problems clear when he said to Mr H, “You fucked me missus.” This was not a case where he wanted to get his clothes back. This was a case where he was angry because he perceived that Ms G had been unfaithful to him after a relationship existing for a mere six weeks. Mr H pointed out to the offender that he had all his clothes on and said, “What are you talking about, mate?” But he still kept fighting Mr H. Sensibly, Mr H said, “I’ll get out. Just let me get my keys.”
	
	
	The offender left a short time later together with the other man there. Police had been called, of course, and they arrived soon afterwards. They saw damage to the front door, they saw damage to an interior timber door and they saw Mr H. He had a cut to the bridge of his nose, a swollen left eye and swelling and bruising to his forehead. He also sustained cuts and bruises to both his hands and he had a saw elbow.
	
	
	The following day the offender went to police. He was arrested and entered into custody. He participated in an interview in which he admitted doing what he had done. He told police, “They just started being smart arses”, and then said, “There was a bloke in the room and just - I don’t know, I just - just - I snapped, yeah.” He told police that he was aware that Ms F’s young son was in the house.
	
	
	He has now pleaded guilty at an early stage to an offence of aggravated break, enter and commit a serious indictable offence, the serious indictable offence being an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The circumstance of aggravation specified for the offence is that he knew there were people inside, but other circumstances of aggravation arise as well, in particular, that the offender was in company.
	
	
	To say this is a serious offence is an understatement. This happened in the presence of a child. It happened in Ms G’s home and, lest it be thought that I have double counted, not all break-enter offences involve a breaking and entry into someone’s home.
	
	
	Consistent with what the offender told police, he pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. The sentence I will ultimately impose upon him will be 25 per cent less to reflect that circumstance.
	
	
	The offender had a good upbringing, especially when compared with the upbringings of most offenders who appear in this Court. His parents still support him despite the troubles he has clearly caused them. He also has the support of his sister, with whom he has been living until recently. He is now 26 years of age. He says that he has changed his life. A reference from his employer was tendered today, although I do note it makes no mention of any knowledge on the part of the employer of the offender’s crimes, in particular, the crime for which he is appearing for sentence today.
	
	
	He says that he is no longer using drugs and does not drink as much as he used to. I should point out that although the offender said he had eight beers on the night that he committed this offence, this is not a matter of mitigation at all, particularly in view of the offender’s regular use of alcohol and engagement in violence in the period leading up to this offence.
	
	
	The offender has a criminal history as well, including an offence of break and enter. He actually received a prison sentence for that offence, but on appeal that was reduced to a section 9 bond. He has committed a domestic violence type offence in the past and, of course, the Crown accurately points out that there is a domestic violence flavour of this offence as well.
	
	
	Mr Fitzgerald, of course, impressed upon me that his client was a very different person to the man who committed the offence. That may or may not be true, but in any case it is a fundamental rule of sentencing that the sentence must reflect the objective gravity of an offender’s conduct. This offence carries with it a standard non-parole period of five years and the authorities tell sentencing judges that sentences of other than full-time custody for offences containing a standard non-parole period should be rare.
	
	
	If I were to sentence Mr Lodge today, I would send him to gaol without hesitation. I will, however, give him the opportunity of proving to me that he is in fact a very different person to the man who broke into the home and assaulted Mr H knowing that a three-year-old child was there. I will adjourn the matter under s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	There will be some conditions of bail which are designed to ensure that when the matter next comes back before me I will know as much as I can about Mr Lodge. It may still be the case that he goes to gaol, but at the very least his good behaviour in the remand period will reduce the time that he spends in custody. It may be, and I make no promises, that a form of sentence other than full-time custody is imposed. Much will depend on whether Mr Lodge does everything he can to prove that he is a reformed character.
	
	
	I will list the matter on 6 July 2018.
	
	
	In addition to his current bail conditions there are these conditions: he is to use no illegal drugs whatsoever; he is to be supervised by the Probation and Parole Service, (and I will order a pre-sentence report for the next occasion).
	
	
	In order to ensure that he is complying with the first condition, that is, that he not use any illegal drugs, he is to undergo regular urinalysis. If the Probation and Parole Service do not arrange at least fortnightly testing, he is to arrange such testing at his own expense. I emphasise at least fortnightly. The results of all urinalysis tests are to be provided to the Court on the next occasion. In the event that he has clean urinalysis reports for some time and the finds the cost and frequency of testing prohibitive, he may approach the Court to seek a relaxation of the frequency of testing.
	
	
	Now, Mr Lodge, I really would have no hesitation sending you to gaol today. I know you have heard me say that a few times, but your conduct was frankly disgraceful. It was particularly disgraceful because not only did you do it, but you continued with a screaming three-year-old child there. That says a lot about your character at the time and none of it good. What you have got to do is prove to me that you are a different person.
	
	
	Let me see if I can put it this way. So serious was your offending that if you want to have a hope of avoiding going to gaol, you are going to have to get what I will call an A-grade pass. That means you are going to have to do everything that you can in the next eight or nine months; keep your job, do not use any drugs, prove to me that you spend your leisure hours in a productive way. They are the sorts of things that Mr Fitzgerald will no doubt discuss with you. If you do not get an A-grade pass, next time I see you, you will be going to gaol. Do you understand that?
	
	
	OFFENDER: Yes.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Thank you. You can leave the dock now, Mr Lodge.
	
	
	ADJOURNED PART HEARD TO FRIDAY 6 JULY 2018 IN SYDNEY

		22 November 2017",2017-10-26 00:00:00,NSW District Court
6453970,"R v ELLIS, Craig Martin [2017] NSWDC 318","SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: My practice is to tell people in advance what sentence I propose to impose. In your case, Mr Ellis, I propose to impose a total sentence of one year and 10 months' imprisonment. I propose to sentence you to a term of imprisonment that will comprise a non-parole period on my calculation of 10 months. The balance of sentence will be 12 months. Therefore you will be required to spend a minimum of 10 months in prison in relation to the offences to which you have pleaded guilty.
	
	
	Sir Walter Scott in 1808 in a poem called Marmion wrote, ""Oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practise to deceive"". This matter involving the two offences to which the prisoner has pleaded guilty demonstrates the wisdom of Sir Walter Scott's observation. This is the case here. Craig Martin Ellis pleaded guilty in this court as I understand it in August 2017 to two charges on the indictment that was presented by the Crown. The first count alleged that he between the 13th day of October 2011 and the 9th day of May 2012 at Wyong in the State of New South Wales with intent to mislead the judicial tribunal, namely the Local Court, in a judicial proceeding, namely the prosecution of Bernard Nash suppressed or concealed closed circuit television footage knowing that it may be required as evidence in a judicial proceeding. This is an offence contrary to s317(a) Crimes Act 1900 and I am informed by the Crown carries a maximum penalty of 10 year
	
	
	imprisonment.
	
	
	The prisoner pleaded guilty to a second count alleging that he between the 16th day of September 2013 and the 18th day of October 2013 at Gosford in the State of New South Wales with the intent to mislead a judicial tribunal, namely a District Court in a judicial proceeding, namely a civil proceeding brought by Bernard Nash against the State of New South Wales suppressed or concealed closed circuit television footing and loyalty ledgers knowing that it (sic) may be required as evidence in a judicial proceeding. This is an offence contrary to the same provisions I earlier identified and has the same maximum penalty. At the time of pleading guilty to the two charges the prisoner had no prior criminal convictions. The prisoner had previously spent no time in custody.
	
	
	In respect of count one this count was a matter that in general terms was prosecuted in the District Court in a trial by jury where the jury was discharged after approximately five days and I have been provided with a transcript of the proceedings of 20 June 2017 which sets out the basis for the discharge of the jury in that matter. The prisoner in that trial, as I understand it, had been arraigned in respect of a charge contrary to s319 Crimes Act 1900, a charge that carries a maximum penalty of 14 years' imprisonment with the s317 charge pleaded as an alternative. In respect of that matter I propose to provide the prisoner with a discount of 5% upon the otherwise appropriate sentence to reflect the utilitarian benefit for the plea of guilty. There is some utilitarian benefit, although slight, bearing in mind the prisoner was committed for trial and there was in fact a trial conducted until the time the jury was discharged. That having been said of course he was prosecuted in respect of a more serious offence and an offence, in the alternative, to which he ultimately pleaded guilty. It should be observed of course that he had the opportunity to plead guilty to the alternative charge on arraignment even if the Crown was not prepared to accept that plea of guilty in discharge of the indictment.    In relation to count two, however, he was in fact committed for sentence in relation to that matter. But the matter committed for sentence was added to the ultimate indictment that was presented for administrative conformity. For that plea entered at the first reasonable opportunity the prisoner receives a discount of 25% upon the otherwise appropriate sentence to represent the utilitarian benefit of that plea of guilty in accordance with the guideline judgment of the Court of Criminal appeal of Thomson and Houlton.
	
	
	The prisoner was born on 26 April 1971. On my calculation that makes him now 46 years of age. As I understand it he was 40 years of age at the time of the commission of the first offence and 42 years at the time of the commission of the second offence. When the offences were committed he was the General Manager of the Shelley Beach Golf Club. The first count in the indictment is a count concerned with judicial proceedings involving a person called Bernard Nash that were ultimately heard on the 18 May 2012 at the Local Court. I am informed in the Agreed Statement of Facts that Mr Nash was being prosecuted on that date in respect of charges of driving under the influence and resisting an officer in the execution of his duty. He was acquitted in relation to those charges although the tampering of evidence of the prisoner apparently played no role in his acquittal, at least directly. Indirectly of course it did because by not providing the material that was sought by police affected the prosecution of the accused man Nash. The Court was denied evidence that it may have taken into account in order to determine beyond reasonable doubt at least the guilt of the offender in respect of the offence of driving under the influence of alcohol.
	
	
	Count two relates to judicial proceedings involving Mr Nash suing the State of New South Wales in respect of claims of wrongful arrest, assault, and malicious prosecution by the New South Wales Police Force arising from his arrest for the Local Court matters. Those proceedings were ultimately heard at the District Court at Gosford on the 10th and 12th November 2014 and Mr Nash received a verdict in his favour and a substantial sum of damages in 2015 which I will particularise later.
	
	
	This affair all started on 13 October 2011 when Senior Constable Michael Hicks, who gave evidence before me, and who at the time was attached to the Tuggerah Lakes Highway Patrol stopped Mr Nash or sought to stop Mr Nash after he was seen exiting the Shelley Beach Golf Club. Mr Hicks pursued Mr Nash's vehicle ""for the purpose of conducting a random breath test"". I am denied in the material tendered as to what precisely happened thereinafter except I am informed in the Agreed Statement of Facts that Mr Nash was ultimately issued a Court Attendance Notice to appear at Wyong Local Court for the offences for which he was ultimately prosecuted in the Local Court.
	
	
	As I understand it the Senior Constable attended on Shelley Beach Golf Club to try and obtain CCTV footage relating to Nash's presence in the club and the alcohol he had drunk. The club had an extensive CCTV camera system with nine cameras throughout the club. The Operations Manager, Sharyn Kennedy, said she would look for the footage and provide that to the police. Ms Kennedy then discussed the matter with the prisoner. The Statement of Facts indicates that on 21 October 2011 a woman called Katy Seaman sent an SMS message to the prisoner indicating that Mr Nash was on his way to see the prisoner. The message conveying what Mr Nash had said, which of course cannot be attributable to the state of mind of the prisoner, included the statement ""Said ud know whats its regarding (sic)""
	
	
	On 17 November 2011 Ms Kennedy emailed to the prisoner a link in which CCTV footage was included that had been saved which showed Mr Nash being given schooners of beer to drink at 3:53, 4:10pm, 4:27pm, 4:48pm, 5:12pm, 5:34pm and 6:03pm on the 13th October. When Mr Hicks returned to the Shelley Beach Golf Club to recover the CCTV footage that he had requested he was told that the footage had been provided to the prisoner and that the footage would not be released until a form of written request was made.
	
	
	I have an exhibit that was at the trial, signed by Mr Hicks, dated 24 November 2011 in the following terms:
	


“To the Licensee/Secretary Manager

I am officially placing a form of demand upon you as the Licensee/Secretary Manager to supply to me the following information.

This form of demand is in accordance with s110 of the Liquor Act 2007 - s58 of the Registered Clubs Act.

The information is required in the investigation of the following offence - permitted intoxicated person.

The required information/documents are:

Video footage from 5pm on 13 October 2011 to 7pm on the 13 October 2011 covering the location of: All areas of the interior of Tuggerah Lakes Golf Club around the bar area and the car park"".


	
	As I understand it this letter was somewhat of a ‘fiction’. It is clear on Mr Hicks' own evidence and the Statement of Facts that the material was being sought in relation to the prosecution of Mr Nash and frankly this material should have been sought by subpoena. Be that as it may the tone of the letter set in motion a course of events that ultimately led to the commission of the offence, but in circumstances that in my view are reflected in the evidence given by the prisoner.
	
	
	The prisoner on 21 December 2011 sent an email to Ms Kennedy indicating that if there was a request for individual files that it should be by subpoena or ""at least a formal written request"". Most importantly, he instructed Ms Kennedy to ""give them entry, exit, and first three purchases"". He must have known at the time of sending that email that there was in fact evidence of other purchases of alcohol by Mr Nash. The Statement of Agreed Facts stated the prisoner edited a version of the CCTV footage and ultimately Mr Hicks was, as I understand it, given that version that contained in this edited footage views of Mr Nash obtaining drinks at 3:53pm, 4:27pm and 5:34pm. The footage also showed Mr Nash entering and exiting the Shelley Beach Golf Club. At this point of course the prisoner must have known Mr Nash was being prosecuted in relation to offences or an offence relating to control of a motor vehicle committed on 13 October 2011.
	
	
	Subsequent investigations by the police at the scene through telephone intercepts and other means revealed conversations the prisoner had in 2015 making admissions about his knowledge of the matter and it reflects on the part of the prisoner some antipathy towards the police officer who was endeavouring to investigate this matter in accordance with his certain responsibilities. He said inter alia in one conversation ""I didn't give him what he needed for his conviction"". Senior Constable Hicks copied the USB stick and apparently provided that to lawyers representing Mr Nash. The matter was heard at the Wyong Local Court 18 May 2012. Mr Nash gave evidence on the basis that, on the video evidence, was clearly untrue and the charges were ultimately dismissed.
	
	
	It would seem based upon the evidence given by the Senior Constable before me that the USB stick was not produced in evidence. There was some dispute between the Senior Constable and apparently the Prosecutor as to what actually happened to it. But no fault can be attributed to the Senior Constable for that matter although I obviously cannot ascribe any fault to the Prosecutor at all in the circumstances of that dispute in these proceedings.
	
	
	Mr Nash wrote to the prisoner in a text message sent to the prisoner ""SBGC (Shelley Beach Golf Club) and Bern one. Lying fuckin' cop nil"". Thus the prisoner would have been aware of the outcome of proceedings. The USB stick that was handed to the Senior Constable has never been recovered. Again a telephone intercept of a conversation reveals the prisoner made an admission about deliberately not giving Senior Constable Hicks the material that was requested.
	
	
	Subsequently, after Mr Nash had commenced civil proceedings in the District Court to which I earlier made reference, the prisoner received a subpoena addressed to the ""Proper Officer"" of the Shelley Beach Golf Club, which I take to be the prisoner, from the legal representatives for the State of New South Wales calling for him to produce relevant CCTV footage of the club on the 13th October 2011 and any documents or information relating to a Bernard Nash which would include any registers kept of any benefits he received from the club on 13 October 2011. Mr Nash in fact on 17 October 2013, the subpoena having been issued on the 16 September 2013, sent an SMS message to the prisoner in these terms:
	


“Hi Craig. The date was 13 October 2011 U just want to make sure everything tallies. Thanks Bernie”


	
	Clearly that text message is alerting the prisoner to the date and the need for the prisoner to accord with what he had evidence previously done to commit Count one. The prisoner answered the subpoena produced by the State of New South Wales and took responsibility for what was produced however again he produced edited CCTV footage. It showed the man Nash obtaining alcohol, that is beer, at 3:15pm, 4:10pm, 4:27pm. Those times were at odd with the original footage provided to Senior Constable Hicks. The footage also showed Nash entering and exiting the Shelley Beach Golf Club. That exhibit became Exhibit H in the District Court proceedings. So in fact it was produced in the proceedings.
	
	
	He also produced written records relating to Nash's attendance at the club including what was called ""a membership Ledger Activity"" record relating to all of the consequent purchases. In respect of this matter the prisoner admitted or conceded knowingly a number of purchases that had been made on that date were excluded from the ledger. The police subsequently were able to obtain the full ledgers which showed the true number, or at least a larger number, of purchases of full strength beer by Nash on 13 October 2011.
	
	
	Her Honour Judge Gibson of our court on 10 June 2015 found in favour of the Plaintiff, Mr Nash, and ordered the State of New South Wales to pay him $124,958 in damages and also to pay Mr Nash's costs. Subsequent to that order of the court, again in November 2015, the prisoner's conversations with the Operations Manager, Ms Kennedy, were recorded. He expressed the fact that he was not disappointed that ""Bern"" did not get fined for drink driving because he ""knew"" (knew) he had a few beers"". He went on to say ""But I'm not disappointed that that didn't get through. I'm so disappointed that some magistrate decided it was appropriate to give him a big friggin payout"". That is common slang. What those comments mean were not fully explained by anybody. The Crown case in relation to count two is that the prisoner responded to the District Court subpoena with amended material intending that the Judicial Tribunal, that is the District Court, would be misled and he did so knowing there were civil proceedings on foot in the District Court.
	
	
	As I said Senior Constable Hicks gave oral evidence and some of the history of his involvement and much of that evidence duplicated what was in the agreed facts. The consequences of the actions of the prisoner, particularly a letter of complaint, he wrote apparently to the Local Area Commander or some senior officer on or about 6 February 2012. The Senior Constable was the subject of an internal investigation which was not appropriate given the true facts of the case. He had not been responsible for any serious wrong doing. The Senior Constable was not suspended nor should he have been.
	
	
	As I said it was unfortunate the way in which the request for the material that was made was in the form of what was in effect a ""fiction"". As I said that material should have been in due course the subject of subpoena and produced to the court controlled by the court and not just handed over to people in the manner in which it was. He confirmed in his evidence what I have earlier indicated that as far as he was aware the recording was not played in the Local Court proceeding and he had no control over that. I accept his evidence the footage was given to the Prosecutor but again what happened to it is of no moment here.
	
	
	The prisoner also gave evidence about the facts of the matter. I should point out in passing that I had regard to all the submissions, both written from the Crown and oral from the Crown and accused's counsel, concerning both the factual issues to be decided and other matters relevant for sentencing. I accept on the prisoner's evidence that whilst he must have met Mr Nash and must have known he was being prosecuted in relation to his management of a motor vehicle he does not have a clear memory of their meeting or their discussion.
	
	
	Although there seems to be some friendliness in the communications with Nash and the prisoner I accept his evidence that Mr Nash was not a personal friend of his. I would understand the General Manager or Secretary Manager or managers of such a club would need to be friendly with all members. He agreed that he had made up his mind not to hand over the full material that was being sought by the Senior Constable by late September 2011 although the actual provision of the edited footage was not provided until February because of the Christmas break and other delays.
	
	
	It is the case, I accept, that the prisoner's interest in the matter as a result of the letter written by Senior Constable Hicks on 24 November 2011 became one where he conflated Mr Nash's interests into the concern he had about the reputation of the club. The prisoner had nothing to gain directly by helping Mr Nash in the Local Court and there was no suggestion of him being paid any money to edit the material. He had nothing to gain in terms of the financial benefit or any other direct benefit, apart from his own self-protection in assisting the conduct of the District Court proceedings by Mr Nash.
	
	
	Although I accept that in relation to count one that his primary concern in respect of his actions was the protection of the reputation of the club thinking that the Nash incident might cause a ‘black mark’, as he described it, being made against the club this was substantially misguided and seriously wrong thinking on his part. I point out he had an obligation as the General Manager to co-operate with police on purported licence enquiries, particularly if they claimed to be conducting an investigation. Although I note he gave evidence about legal advice he had sought concerning the character of this investigation and as I understand his evidence the club had a spotless record which he was very anxious to protect.
	
	
	Misleading the investigation for the benefit of his employer it must be said is only marginally less serious than misleading a court, although it may not necessarily lead to a criminal charge. He must have known, however, in providing the footage to the Senior Constable in due course that the material was used or could be used for court purposes. He must have also known, one would have thought, that if it was favourable to Mr Nash it might end up not being used in the prosecution of Mr Nash. Although I do note in fairness to Senior Constable Hicks that he attended upon the officers of the solicitor of Mr Nash and apparently provided a copy of the material to the defence well before the hearing which is entirely proper. The Prosecution has a positive duty to provide all relevant information to the defence to ensure no miscarriages of justice occur and that is very much to his credit.
	
	
	As he was responsible for the stewardship of the club the prisoner would be judged on its performance so it is to be fairly said that he had something to gain indirectly by protecting the club's reputation. He was responsible for its reputation and if the Nash incident reflected mal-practice by the club to discharge its obligations then the prisoner was accountable for that. In making himself accountable to my mind he had an obligation to reveal the truth of the situation and apply the responsibility that he himself had in this regard. That having been noted I accept that he had worked very hard to build up a reputation at the club and he had been involved in providing ambitious plans for development of the club. I had actually been to the club on one occasion. I have a friend who lives nearby and is a member and it is to be fairly said, although I was there only a few years ago not long after the prisoner had left its employ, it appeared to be a fine club indeed.
	
	
	I accept his evidence that the criminality involved in count two, which is obviously more serious for reasons put by the Crown, arose from the fact that he was fearful that his earlier misconduct not be uncovered and was primarily seeking to protect himself. The reputation of the club no longer was an issue. It should be noted what makes his conduct in relation to the second count more serious as well was the fact that there were two acts involved in the criminality, both the editing of the CCTV footage and falsifying the ledger records of the club. He was trying on his own admission in relation to count two to protect himself and this attitude on his part compounds the totality of his criminality. As I said he knew by 2013 that the reputation of the club was not at stake, just his own. It was a serious failure of judgment and character to do what he did. I accept that despite the time over which this conduct occurred and separate criminality over a period of almost two years the conduct of the prisoner was entirely uncharacteristic.
	
	
	He may have seen himself, of course, in relation to count two of having what is described as ‘Hobson's Choice’, or ‘Sophie's Choice’, in a sense. But the truth is he chose badly and wrongly.
	
	
	I note in this regard as is relevant to this sentencing exercise and sequelae of the misconduct, and properly so, has been the termination of his employment. He obviously has had to leave his employment in disgrace. He was given a modest pay out in total of $5000. This, of course, would be damaging to any future opportunities he may have in the industry because of his reputation. There has been a substantial loss of reputation and, correctly, a loss of employment, financial benefits and cost accordingly.
	
	
	To turn to some aspects of the submissions in relation to the assessment of the seriousness of the offending the Crown referred me to some authorities. In Reid [2016] NSWCCA 151, that particular offender, if my memory serves me correctly a respondent in a Crown appeal, had been prosecuted pursuant to s319, a more serious offence than an offence under s 317 I note the observations of the court at [40-[44]. Apart from any matters of general principle in Reid about offences of this kind the Crown called in aid Reid in respect of comparative sentencing purposes. Although of course comparative sentencing for offenders where they are committing different offences is a problematic area.
	
	
	The Crown also referred me to the decision of Malicki [2015] NSWCCA 162, particularly at [60], which emphasised, although again concerned with different offending, the seriousness of offences involved with misleading courts. The court system depends upon the honesty of people, particularly practitioners, of course, but also litigants who come before it and those seeking to support litigants by either production of documents or evidence. In Malicki there was a reference to other judgments, Marinellis [2006] NSWCCA 307, I particularly note the observations at [8], and an earlier decision of Giang [2001] NSWCCA 276, where in that judgment, particularly at [27] it was adopted by the court the expression that in public justice offences of this type there was a need to impose a sentence in the appropriate case that ""hurt significantly"". Particularly in that case where an offender sought to benefit from his dishonest conduct which is not as much an issue in this case as it was in that case. I should also note in relation to Reid the issue of personal benefit was very much in the forefront.
	
	
	Another authority I was not referred to but a very important authority in this regard is a decision concerning Marcus Einfeld, (Einfeld [2010] NSWCCA 87). Of course the former Federal Court Judge was prosecuted in relation to offences of perjury and under s319 which are more serious offences than those with which I am concerned here. Although they are serious enough. I note the observations at [81]-[83] in Einfeld. In those observations the Court made the point that offences of this type are more serious where a person who has the full understanding of the law and the operation of the law and has obligations and responsibilities not only to uphold the law but to act honourably in the execution of any conduct in relation to activity is to be considered more serious misconduct. In relation to the matter of Einfeld I will come back to that, because there is some discussion in that judgment too about ""extra curial punishment"".
	
	
	I mentioned earlier the prisoner had no prior criminal convictions. I have a body of material that has been provided by the prisoner in addition to his evidence. I have a psychological report from Ms Fleur Taylor who works for a practice called LSC Psychology. That report is dated 18 September 2017. Ms Taylor is a registered psychologist, not a medical practitioner. But she is a member of a practice the principals of which, Dr Lenning and Dr Siedler, are well regarded by the courts as people of integrity. Much of the history provided in the report I accept. The prisoner gave evidence in relation to matters of personal history that were not challenged at all to any degree and much of his history is confirmed by the references that have been tendered and admitted without objection.
	
	
	I note the background of the prisoner of some family dislocation. The prisoner's natural father, it would appear, abandoned the family and had been responsible for mis-conduct towards members of his family which I need not state in open court. The prisoner had a very close attachment with his mother and it would appear also has a close attachment with his stepfather whose surname he adopted. He also has a close attachment to his full brother and sister and I have a number of references from his siblings and other people stating their support and speaking of his character.
	
	
	The prisoner has a settled family relationship. He has one child of his marriage who is aged 15 and he has two step-daughters aged 23 and 20. He has been in this relationship with his wife for 20 years and it is a positive relationship, a ‘pro-social relationship’ might be another way to describe it. His family continue to support him and he has strongly supported his family with his industry over the years. The report sets out his academic achievements. He completed a Science Degree at the University of Sydney. He then commenced a Masters of Environmental Law but became disenchanted with that and took up a traineeship in the club industry. He obtained a Masters in Business Administration during his traineeship and he also completed a Graduate Diploma in Applied Corporate Governance in 2014, after the commission of the offences with which I am concerned. He had a ""long term and stable employment history"" and as I understand it had worked at the relevant club over a period of eight years. He took his responsibilities ""seriously"" and had reported wrong doing on the part of staff to the authorities in the past. Generally speaking, he had ""high moral and ethical codes"" which completely abandoned him, or he abandoned them, in the commission of these offences. The report sets out the history of the development of the club which I have already referred to and also denotes the termination of his employment.
	
	
	Since the termination of his employment he has established a garden maintenance business and this apparently has worked well. I am sure his industry and his flair would assist him in developing that work although certainly it would not be as remunerative as working as a General Manager of a club. He has some history of past use of cannabis but does not have any drug addiction issues and is a moderate drinker of alcohol. He was apparently drinking heavily over the period of the offending behaviour but that is not really a matter of relevance in this offending. He has given some history of treatment for depressive symptoms in 2012 and was supplied with a prescription of antidepressants. He has had continuing symptoms since that period of time and some deterioration in his ""mental health"". He has had some past history as a child of treatment for cerebral meningitis and has had symptoms of anxiety since he was a child. He said to the psychologist that at the time of the offending he was under a great deal of pressure relating to his work and the responsibilities there led to some financial pressure that had arisen because he and his wife had gone into a collateral business venture that was unsuccessful. He has had some periods of depressive symptoms that have affected his enjoyment of life in various ways, as is not infrequently the case in people with heavy responsibilities.
	
	
	I have got details of his history in relation to his use of antidepressant medicine. The psychologist opined that ""considering his past and current symptomology it is (her) opinion that the prisoner is suffering from symptoms consistent with diagnoses of Generalised Anxiety Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder in accordance with the criteria of DSM 5 (The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder)”. I will come back to that assessment in a moment. There was some psychometric assessment made of his personality. Amongst other things it notes a decline in self-esteem which would follow his charging. He is a person who is somewhat self-critical and uncertain and sometimes indecisive. However his inter-personal style seems best characterised as being ""domineering and able to control"". He seemingly ""has a strong need to control others and expects respect and admiration"". The psychologist noted that it is the case that others probably view him as ""rather over bearing and dictatorial"", qualities probably well suited for a person trying to run licensed premises. It notes his positive relationships and makes comments upon his reasons for committing offences. I have already dealt with that aspect of the matter on the evidence the prisoner has given.
	
	
	The formulation of the matter is that the prisoner is a person who over the years has had various symptoms of anxiety and depression. He has sought to obtain help in relation to this matter it would seem not until 2012 and he has suffered some deterioration in his ""mental health"" because of his reaction to the circumstances in which he finds himself which are both financial and, of course, relate to the fact that he faces a term of imprisonment.
	
	
	The psychologist makes some recommendations in relation to his treatment, if given a custodial sentence. There would be a psychologist to assist him in the difficult adjustment to custody and to assist him in adapting to his new environment and beyond. He should have counselling on his release from custody.
	
	
	I have, as I have said, a number of references from siblings and/or people that are related to the prisoner by marriage and also a reference from a neighbour. The family members speak highly of his industry and his achievements, his positive qualities. As a member of the family he is a supportive brother to his siblings and a supportive child, particularly to his mother. His brother, whose name I have no need to put on the record, has advised me that he is a Commander in the Royal Australian Navy with 24 years of service and obviously is a man of considerable respect within the community. He has known the prisoner obviously all of his life and noted his passion for his family and his work and how hard work has driven him over many years.
	
	
	He said that he thought that the prisoner's ""reaction to the situation"" he found himself in was very much reflected in his deep investment in his workplace and his family. In part that may be correct in relation to count 1, but has little weight in relation to count 2. He says that the prisoner is contrite and accepts that he has done the wrong thing. The prisoner's stepfather has also provided a reference and speaks positively of his qualities and what a credit he has been to his family.
	
	
	His medical practitioner has been treating him for 16 years. He believes the offending that he has admitted is a ""paradox"" and has affected him severely from an ""emotional perspective"". He has been treated for both ""depression and anxiety"" during the past four years as well as organising his psychological support. This letter provides support for some of the history that has been provided to the psychologist.
	
	
	His brother-in-law has written a positive reference of the prisoner's qualities both as a family member and as a member of the community. As has a neighbour who speaks of the prisoner's contribution to the community in a range of ways, his support to the neighbour's family when their child was diagnosed with leukaemia and the way in which he has provided, for example, the facilities of the Shelly Beach Golf Club when he was the General Manager to assist in community matters and fundraising for his daughter's treatment. He identifies the prisoner, again as everyone else does, as industrious, driven, passionate and loyal.
	
	
	What emerges from all of this material is the prisoner is a person who is driven to success. Perhaps he may have in some aspects of his personality a ""take no prisoner's attitude"" and that to some extent is reflected in his communications with people in respect of his offending behaviour. Particularly in communications with his staff, to which I have referred. But it is to be fairly said that he has succeeded up until his fall from grace with discipline application and considerable industry.
	
	
	I have already noted that he has very strong family support and overcome a number of difficulties to rise to the position that he reached. It was, however, a position of trust that he had as General Manager of the club. It may be said that he allowed his personal investment in the club to distract his attention from the usual standards of honesty and probity, which earned him his reputation and career.
	
	
	It might be said in this context to be some element of a ""breach of trust"" that is the trust put in him by the Directors of the club and its members to conduct the club's affairs honourably. But ultimately I do not conclude that breach of trust is such as an ""aggravating factor"" arising under s 21A(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which I will hereafter refer to as ""the Act"".
	
	
	To come back to the psychologist's report the Crown took issue with the ""diagnosis"" to which I have referred. I do not see it as a ""diagnosis"". The report states a history of the symptoms consistent with particular conditions that fit the constellations of symptoms that would be identified in the manual ‘DSM-5’, which psychologists cite regularly in their report. I accept that the history provided by the prisoner, the short report from the medical practitioner, the prescription of antidepressant medication, stand consistent with the symptomatology identified by the psychologist.
	
	
	Of course, much of the subsequent symptomatology since his arrest in relation to the matter giving rise to count 1 would be seen as a reaction to his current legal difficulties which would, of course, be greatly troubling to a person who is by nature not lawless or antisocial. He has never had any conflict with the police or been in gaol. There is, in my view, no evidence of causal connection between his conduct in 2011 to 2012, which is the foundation of subsequent events, and any symptomatology reflected in the report or the histories provided by the prisoner.
	
	
	There was in fact no particular submission made that there was such a causal connection established. As I have said the history does not suggest any particular treatment until 2012. That is it would seem after the commission of count 1.
	
	
	The principles relating to the sentencing of a person who can be found on the evidence to be suffering some form of mentally disability, disorder or illness were summarised by the then McClellan CJ CL, in DPP (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194 at [177]-[178]. I do not propose to recite them. His Honour by surveying a number of authorities, including some authorities I will refer to in a moment, reflected on the existence of a mental condition or disability reducing, in the appropriate case, the person's moral culpability and may reduce the weight required for general deterrence, although where it is causally connected it may increase the weight to be given to personal deterrence.
	
	
	Assuming the development of the symptomatology, particularly from 2012, it would seem that anxiety depressive symptoms may have somewhat been contemporaneously connected to the events in count 2. But the prisoner in his account does not claim any direct connection, except of course the anxiety caused by fear of exposure of his earlier misconduct relating to count 1.
	
	
	Where there is evidence of a mental condition, which does have not have to be severe as McClellan CJ CL pointed out in De La Rosa , at [178], it still remains relevant to the sentencing process, even if it is one that has developed subsequent to the offending.
	
	
	In the decision of Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 particularly at [71] the then Gleeson CJ said that:
	


“Even if the condition was not causally connected to the offending it may still result in some reduction of sentence, all a matter of degree.""


	
	For example, in consideration of matters of rehabilitation or the need for treatment outside the prisoner system. There are a number of other decisions that discuss the presence of a mental disorder or the symptoms of a mental disorder that are not causally connected. There is the decision of Iskandar [2013] NSWCCA 235 particularly at [23], [27]-[30]. This was a particularly strong bench, President Beazley, RA Hulme J and Bellew J. That judgment, the sections that I have referred to, noted that even where a mental disorder or mental condition was not causally connected it may still be a matter relevant to the weight to be given to general deterrence, but depending upon the particular circumstances.
	
	
	Another decision is Phanekham [2015] NSWCCA 295, particularly at [4], which adopted the dicta in Iskandar.
	
	
	A more recent decision is that of Kearsley [2017] NSWCCA 28, particularly at [4]-[8]. That case cited the observations of Gleeson CJ and in the same case the observations of Allen J, as he then was. Justice Allen had noted, which the Court approved:
	


“Even in a case where an offender has a mental disability which is unrelated to the commission of the crime the sympathy which his condition must attract in the eyes of others in the community generally may be such that to sentence him with full weight given to general deterrence might have no impact at all upon others. Human sympathy would say: ‘Well, you would not expect him to get the same sentence as someone else’. (Engert at 72).""


	
	It should be pointed out in Kearsley, whilst adopting that observation, their Honours said in that particular case ordinary members of the community would not have been expected a person suffering from a depressive condition of the kind that Mr Kearsley suffered to receive a significantly lower sentence for the offences of the type in question, than would otherwise be the case. General deterrence remained of significance when re-sentencing Mr Kearsley.
	
	
	So is the case here, in my view. His mental state is a matter to be taken into account both in the consideration of his rehabilitation and in consideration of his offending relevant to count 2, but it is not a matter of great significance in terms of diminishing the weight to be given to general deterrence.
	
	
	In that regard I note the terms of s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the purposes of sentencing. I am required to ensure that the prisoner is adequately punished. I have got to prevent him and other from committing similar offences. I do not believe there is a need to protect the community from the offender and I am required to promote his rehabilitation, to make him accountable for his actions and to denounce his account.
	
	
	I must note in relation to this matter, particularly in respect to count 2, there was harm to the community in that the State was required to defend an action that was inappropriate and ultimately was ordered to make a payment of costs as well as damages to Mr Nash, which I assume will be taken away from him in due course. But through no thanks to the prisoner.
	
	
	So far as matters arising under s 5 of the Act are concerned obviously in this matter there is no other penalty that can be imposed other than a term of imprisonment his counsel conceded that. His counsel's submissions were that I should impose a term of imprisonment, but which in total would permit consideration of the suspension of the terms of imprisonment and/or a performance of an Intensive Correction Order.
	
	
	It would be clear from the sentence I foreshadowed to the prisoner that those options are available bearing in mind I have determined upon the total sentences which does not exceed two years. But, in my view, the imposition of a sentence other than imprisonment would not give full weight to the matters, particularly identified by the learned Crown Prosecutor, concerning the weight of general deterrence.
	
	
	So far as s 21A(2) of the Act is concerned I accept some submissions of the Crown. Although I anticipated the Crown's submissions, I believe. Because I discussed the matter with counsel for the prisoner before I had even read the Crown's submissions. The prisoner was a person of good character at the time of the offence reflected in count 1. The weight to be given to good character in relation to count 2, however, is diminished because of the time of the commission of count 2 the prisoner was an undetected offender in relation to count 1 and the commission of count 2 is very much connected to his conduct in respect of count 1.
	
	
	Whilst he was not of such good character at the time of commission for count 2 for the reasons more eloquently I believe set out in the Crown's written submissions, that does not mean, of course, that good character has no weight in relation to count 2. One has to look at the whole of a person's life. As I have earlier pointed out the conduct I am concerned with is uncharacteristic and there cannot be any suggestion of the prisoner being blameworthy in any particular respect before his involvement in these offences. Good character is still relevant in relation to count 2. But not of as much weight as in relation to count 1.
	
	
	The Crown submitted there was planning involved in the offences. However, as that expression is understood by the superior courts in relation to s 21A I concluded that the offences were not part of ""planned or organised criminal activity"". At the time of the commission of each offence he had no record of criminal convictions, as I have pointed out he was effectively un-convicted at that time in relation to count 1 when he committed the offence in count 2.
	
	
	I accept he is unlikely to re-offend. I believe this matter will be a salutary experience. I believe in all the circumstances he has excellent prospects of rehabilitation. He has demonstrated that by his past conduct up until the time of the commission of count 1; and also in his industry since he lost his employment.
	
	
	I can find no evidence of remorse in relation to count 1. Admittedly he was defending a more serious charge, in part, but his conduct in relation to count 1 has to be considered in light of his reaction almost two years later in 2013, thus giving rise to the criminality in count 2.
	
	
	Remorse or contrition of a person who runs over a child in the street, jumps out of the car, expresses immediate regret and seeks to provide aid, even though he or she may have committed a criminal offence, is truly evidence of remorse and contrition worthy of great weight. While in this matter whilst the prisoner has expressed regret for his conduct in count 1 the Crown, very fairly, acknowledges that is the case. But it is not a matter where one could conclude that a mitigating factor is established of remorse in respect to count 1 pursuant to s 21A(3)(i) of the Act.
	
	
	However, I am prepared to accept that he is relevantly remorseful, that is he has taken for full responsibility for his conduct in relation to the matters giving rise to count 2. I find that as a mitigating factor in respect of that count alone, his pleas of guilty are themselves mitigating factors.
	
	
	There are two offences I am required to sentence the prisoner on the totality of the criminality. The High Court Australia in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610, particularly in the majority judgment at [45], reflected upon the need for transparency in sentencing and thus in sentencing for more than one offence an appropriate sentence for each offence and thus turn to the issue of occurrence and/or accumulation, or partial accumulation, to reflect the totality of the offending.
	
	
	What was decided in Pearce has been reflected upon by the Court of Criminal Appeal in quite a number of decisions, one leading judgment in this regard is one of some age of Simpson J in the 2000 decision of Hammoud, but there are many authorities that deal with the requirement of a Judge to give full effect of the totality of criminality. I have endeavoured to do that by making the sentence in relation to count 2 partially accumulative upon the sentence in relation to count 1.
	
	
	By definition from what I have said, even allowing for fact that there are some mitigating factors in relation to count 1 that do not apply in relation to count 2 and vice versa, the criminality involved in count 2 is more serious than the criminality involved in count 1. Because there is no standard non-parole period I am not required to be trying to fit some matter within the rubric of the ""middle range of objective seriousness"". In the scheme of conduct, however, that s 317 contemplates, having regard to the personal circumstances of the prisoner, that is the lack of direct personal benefit and the various matters I have taken into account as objective facts I would regard the criminality in relation to count 1 as not at the lowest end but at a level, to come back to the standard non-parole period argot, of well below the middle range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	In relation to count 2 that is more serious conduct, perhaps by reference to that ‘argot’, at the cusp of the lower level of the middle range of objective seriousness. I again make the point that if this sort of conduct was performed by a solicitor or a barrister one would expect - to use the Crown's words - ""condign punishment"". The most severe punishment to be imposed upon that person. Likewise a police officer who tampered with evidence in procuring a conviction of somebody for a crime that they did not commit, with respect, would be ""condign punishment"" to which the Crown referred in his written submissions.
	
	
	There is some element of extra-curial punishment to be considered. I am mindful of what of what was discussed in Einfeld, particularly at [87]‑[97]. The Court at [88] reflected upon the judgment of Whealy JA in sentencing René Rivkin [2003] NSWSC 447, which is cited at [88]. It was noted in Einfeld that the statements of Whealy JA were not the subject of adverse comment on the appeal of Rivkin (see Rivkin [2004] NSWCCA 7 particularly at [411]-[412].)
	
	
	I am mindful, of course, that where reputations are lost and considerations of extra-curial punishment arise that there is an element of ""double counting"" that might arise. Their Honours said it thus:
	


“Loss of good standing in the community may readily give rise to an element of double-counting if the offender is also given favourable consideration for his or her prior good character taking into account of the economic consequences (including loss of employment) which inevitably follows from imprisonment may mean that those previously in employment will serve shorter sentences than those who are unemployed.”


	
	Their Honours noted that, however, in the context of what had been said by Whealy JA, the loss of opportunity arising from one's conduct in the future and an economic loss that would follow from that would be seen as a category which had ""extra-curial punishment"". I appreciate of course their Honours discussed the fact that ""extra-curial punishment"" had taken on a wider meaning since, for example, the decision in Daetz [2003] NSWCCA 216.
	
	
	If my memory serves me correctly in relation to Mr Daetz he was alleged to have assaulted a man's daughter as he was leaving the police station. The man came in and broke his jaw to revenge himself on the alleged misconduct towards the daughter. Be that as it may that is a very clear example of extra-curial punishment, as was the conduct towards Mr Allpass, a famous Crown appeal in respect of a man convicted of indecent assault of a child in the District Court, which was considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in 1993 (Allpass (1993) A Crim A 561).
	
	
	The ‘extra-curial punishment’ here is limited. It is not a highly significant matter, but it is a matter of some relevance to the assessment of the appropriate sentences to be imposed.
	
	
	I have determined that there are ‘special circumstances’ pursuant to s 44 of the Act. In this matter partial accumulation of a sentence is itself a special circumstance that has been long held since the introduction of the Sentencing Act back in the late 1990s. There is also, in my view, a requirement for an extended period of supervision to assist the prisoner to adjust to the community. He will need, in my view, some assistance in relation to some of the aspects of psychological distress, if I could call it that, which has been evidenced particularly over the last four or five years.
	
	
	I believe that I have taken into account all the relevant matters raised with me either directly or in the submissions of the parties.
	
	
	Could you please stand up, Mr Ellis?
	
	
	In relation to matters to which you pleaded guilty in respect to count 1 you are convicted. You are sentenced to a 9 months 2 weeks imprisonment. The starting point is 10 months. The discount of 5% is one-twentieth, which accords you a discount of approximately 2 weeks. To commence on 19 October 2017 and, as I personally calculated it, it expires on 2 August 2018. The sentence corrector will no doubt tell me if it should be 1 or 3 August.
	
	
	In relation to count 2 you are also convicted. You will be sentenced to 6 months imprisonment by way of non-parole period to commence on 19 February 2018. That will expire on 18 August 2018.
	
	
	In respect of that sentence I fix a balance of sentence of 12 months imprisonment that will expire on 18 August 2019.
	
	
	You can take a seat. Any other matters, Mr Crown?
	
	
	BARRETT: No.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Any other matters, Mr Watts?
	
	
	WATTS: That date which you have commenced the sentence from?
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Yes, 19 October. It will have to be 20 October, expiring thus on 3 August 2018; and thus the sentence in relation to count 2 to commence on 20 February 2018 expiring on 19 August 2018. The balance of sentence expiring on 19 August 2019. My apologies.
	
	
	I direct that you be released to parole at the expiry of the non-parole period and be subject to the conditions of the supervision fixed for you by the Parole Authority.
	
	
	You will have to go with the Corrective Services officers, who are here now.

		13 November 2017",2017-10-19 00:00:00,NSW District Court
6453986,"R v MOK, Hin Lok [2017] NSWDC 314","SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Hin Lok Mok today appears for sentence in relation to an offence to which he pleaded guilty at the Local Court, which is an offence of knowingly take part in an attempt to manufacture or produce a prohibited drug. Specifically it alleges that the offender between 18 January 2016 and 25 January 2016 at Campsie did knowingly attempt to take part in the manufacture of an amount of a prohibited drug to wit 88.5 kilograms of methylamphetamine, which was not less than the large commercial quantity applicable to that prohibited drug.
	
	
	This is an offence contrary to section 24(2) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, a provision that is to be considered with section 33 of the same Act. The maximum penalty for which there has been some discussion, shortly before I commenced my remarks on sentence is life imprisonment and/or a fine of 5,000 penalty units. The standard non-parole period for this offence is 15 years imprisonment, according to the Table annexed to section 54D Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	The offender has been in custody since the date of his arrest 25 January 2016 and I will backdate his sentence to that date to take into account all the time spent in custody referable to this offence.
	
	
	The offender pleaded guilty at the Local Court on 7 February 2017. True it is that he pleaded guilty at the Local Court in excess of a year after he was arrested but as he was committed for sentence I am prepared to conclude that he entered his plea of guilty at the first reasonable opportunity. There is a “co-offender” called Hok Man Tsang. I am informed that he had a trial listed for 19 August 2017 but I understand he has not been sentenced yet.
	
	
	The co-accused Ng to whom Mr Coyne refers in his submissions is not referred to in your cover sheet, has that person been dealt with in the courts or not?
	
	
	SWEENEY: No she hasn’t your Honour, that matter is listed for trial your Honour in February next year.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: February next year, I may have been told that but I don’t have a transcript of the previous proceedings. Thank you for that. I understood that I would have been told if any of the co-accused had been dealt with.
	
	
	The co-accused Ng who was arrested at the same time as the offender is listed for trial in February next year. If I have not already said it, bearing in mind I just interrupted my remarks the offender will receive a discount of 25% upon the otherwise appropriate sentence to recognise the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty in accordance with the guideline judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in relation to these matter of Thomson & Houlton from 1999.
	
	
	The facts of the matter I will summarise although they are extensive and helpful. Police in late 2015 in an investigation obviously arising from previous inquiries located very large quantities of methylamphetamine that had been imported into Australia and lodged into a number of self-storage facilities that had been rented by Mr Tsang (to whom I earlier referred). The facts available to me reveal that relevant storage units that contain methylamphetamine when searched by police on 24 and 30 December 2015 were located at Miranda, Padstow, Hurstville and Rockdale. When searched just before Christmas 2015, at Miranda 3,332 bottles were found containing 333 litres of methylamphetamine, at Padstow 2,000 bottles were found which contained 200 litres of methylamphetamine.
	
	
	On 30 December 2015 search warrants were executed in respect of storage units at Hurstville and Rockdale to which I referred. At the Hurstville location were found bottles containing 200 litres of methylamphetamine and at the Rockdale location was found equipment available for the purpose of manufacture of either methylamphetamine or the crystalline version of methylamphetamine and also was found two kilograms of methylamphetamine that was in the process of being converted from liquid to crystalline form.
	
	
	Mr Tsang was it would seem under police surveillance at the relevant time. He was a gentleman who had travelled apparently to Australia on a number of occasions prior to late 2015. The offender travelled to Australia landing in Brisbane in company with a person called Sou Ping Ng. The offender arrived in Australia on 2 January 2016 and as I understand the matter was travelling from Brisbane with some type of tour group, presumably to make his arrival in Australia as anonymous as possible. The offender arrived in Sydney on 9 January 2016 with Ng in the tour group.
	
	
	The police in the course of their searches of the storage units had substituted for the methylamphetamine various inert substances that were later, it would seem, provided to the offender by Tsang in the belief that he was providing him with the raw materials for the conversion of the liquid methylamphetamine into crystalline form.
	
	
	On 16 January 2016 Tsang went to Rockdale and removed a number of items which he took to premises at Hurstville. It is said in the facts that, “on the Crown case this was manufacturing equipment”. The statement of facts has extracts from telephone intercepts presumably involving conversations in the Chinese language in which either Mr Tsang or the offender over a period of time between 17 January 2016 and 25 January 2016 discussed matters relating to the manufacture of methylamphetamine with an unknown person who was a man contacted in China.
	
	
	The first such extract available in the facts is a translated version of a conversation between Tsang and the ‘Chinese connection’ which is clearly not a reference to the offender, where Tsang advised on 17 January that “Chang Mo was moving ‘there’ the next day”. Chang Mo is the offender Mok and the reference is to the fact that on the following day 18 January 2016 Mr Mok entered into a lease for the occupation of premises at unit 19/45 South Parade, Campsie which I will herein after refer to as the ‘Campsie premises’.
	
	
	The statement of facts has a record of discussions that occurred on 18 January and 22 January 2016 between Tsang and the person in China that clearly were concerned with the forthcoming process of “manufacture” which the offender attempted in the period of time pleaded in the Court attendance notice. The statement of facts refers to Tsang removing items particularly from the Rockdale premises that were items presumably concerned to assist in the manufacture of a relevant prohibited drug and also attendance by Tsang to the storage unit at Hurstville in which he took five Kennard’s storage boxes which the police had examined on 30 December 2015, which contained 200/100 millilitre bottles, which as I mentioned earlier contained a total of 200 litres of methylamphetamine.
	
	
	The man Tsang on the same date 23 January 2016 took various items to the premises at Campsie Tsang and the offender Mok were observed removing bags and boxes from Tsang’s car and taking them to the unit. Five of the boxes were taken into the unit and five boxes were returned to Hurstville.
	
	
	The facts state that that evening the offender removed and cooked liquid in the unit at Campsie in an attempt to convert the liquid to a crystalline substance and Ng was present throughout the evening. Mok the offender spoke on 24 January 2017 to an unknown man who called from China and the offender indicated, in the extract of the conversation set out in the facts, that he was having difficulty in the manufacturing process. Clearly this was so because what he was trying to convert into crystalline methylamphetamine was not capable of doing that.
	
	
	The man in China apparently rang Tsang shortly afterwards to discuss the difficulties. In fact he spoke to him twice that evening and after those conversations the offender was rung by the “unknown man” from China and he was questioned about the circumstances in which the process did not work.
	
	
	Tsang was spoken to after that conversation and then minutes later, all these conversations occurring on the evening of 24 January, the offender was again rung by the man from China and further questions were asked of the offender about the process which had been clearly unsuccessful and known to be so by the offender. In fact the following day 25 January 2016 the offender himself called the “unknown man” in China and had further discussions about the process of manufacture. Later that same afternoon approximately an hour after the conversation between the offender and the man in China police executed a search warrant at the Campsie premises and both Ng and the offender were arrested. Inside a bedroom in the unit police located a large quantity of liquid that Mr Mok believed to be methylamphetamine, this was in fact the inert substance that had been earlier substituted, a large amount of equipment that is used in converting methylamphetamine to crystalline form was located in the bedroom. The bulk of the substituted material was located in small 100 millilitre bottles stored in two suitcases and a soft bag. The bags were visible on the floor and when the soft bag was unzipped there were 100 millilitre bottles clearly visible.
	
	
	On a shelf in the bedroom wardrobe was a glass jar containing a quantity of inert liquid. In a plastic box in the lounge room just outside the door to Ms Ng’s bedroom were a large number of opened 100 millilitre empty bottles and a pair of plastic gloves. In the kitchen there was a quantity of crystalline powder, on the kitchen bench-top, this was also an inert substance.
	
	
	Mr Tsang was arrested the same evening, a search warrant was executed at his premises at Hurstville and he was found in possession of a sum of cash amounting to $12,500 in a satchel and $4,000 in a suitcase and a small amount of crystalline methylamphetamine was located weighing 200 grams.
	
	
	The offender has admitted in the context of what was found at his premises to attempting to manufacture the quantity of methylamphetamine as it is described in the Court attendance notice of 88.5 kilograms. I am not assisted by how that calculation was made.
	
	
	The offender has no prior criminal convictions in New South Wales or apparently overseas. He was born on 28 December 1978. Thus, on my calculation, will turn 40 at the end of next year. He would have been on my calculation 37 at the time of the commission of the offence with which I am concerned. He gave an interview to police which is electronically recorded. He made some partial admissions but made no real admissions of guilt and certainly sought to, if not mislead the police, deflect suspicion upon himself. In my view the account he gave of not knowing particular people with whom he had been in contact was untruthful as the facts make clear.
	
	
	It is clear that he must have known who Mr Tsang was. He must have known his name and the fact that he was not only contacted by somebody from China but was able to contact that person himself, reflects that he must have had knowledge of who that person was and I would have thought, where that person was. Although he did make some admissions about his possession of various items that were relevant to the manufacture in the circumstances of his arrival in Australia. It really would not have mattered very much in proof of his guilt because the proof of his guilt in the context of the telephone intercepts and the evidence found through police investigations was completely overwhelming.
	
	
	The offender did not give evidence before me but produced through his counsel a psychological report. I note the Crown has not had the opportunity to test the history given by the offender. So far as the history given by the offender about his personal circumstances, there is nothing particularly controversial about it as it relates to this sentencing procedure because there is nothing in the report to reflect upon an existing health condition, either mental or physical that would warrant a diminution to be given to the weight for general deterrence, personal deterrence and the like that ordinarily would be required and will be required in this sentencing exercise.
	
	
	As I understand his history the offender grew up in Hong Kong where he was born. He apparently had an unhappy childhood in a range of ways and he left school when he was 15. He did a traineeship in air-conditioning installation and has had various labouring jobs. So in the context of the offender not being tested in relation to his history it is a matter where one would have to approach some of the history with some circumspection. But as I said there is little in the way of significance in the report.
	
	
	Of course in the history it should be noted, even in its own terms, there is absolutely nothing said by the offender in relation to what is self-evident from the facts, that the offender must have had some skills in relation to the manufacture of crystal-methylamphetamine. This is because on the facts available to this Court it is clear and established beyond reasonable doubt that the offender had come to Australia, notwithstanding he initially joined a tour group, for the purpose of the manufacture of crystal-methylamphetamine. He had been “specially imported” for that task.
	
	
	Mr Tsang was the organiser in Australia, as the facts make clear at least so far as the facts presented in this case, and Mr Tsang had set up the arrangements whereby pure methylamphetamine or at least liquid methylamphetamine of a percentage purity I am not sure, would be available to enable the process of crystal-methylamphetamine production to occur on Australian soil.
	
	
	Whether the offender however was to involve himself in a process of manufacture beyond the one that was interrupted by the police, or was unsuccessful before the police arrested the offender, clearly I am unable to say. Whether there was some other process of manufacturing going on in Mr Tsang’s apartment or in some other location I am unable to say although I do note, although it is not evidence particularly relevant to this offender, but as the facts reveal Mr Tsang had control of a rental storage area at Rockdale which had two kilograms of methylamphetamine that was in the process of being converted to crystalline form.
	
	
	It may well have been that Mr Tsang himself had some skills in relation to this process of manufacture. Clearly the evidence from the telephone intercepts suggest that he had knowledge of the matters of which Mr Mok spoke and of which the man from China spoke when discussing the failure of the process of manufacture that had occurred up until 24 January.
	
	
	Coming back to the psychologist’s report the psychologist suggests that the offender was, from the viewpoint of the psychologist “in hindsight” suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder at the time after he had left school as a result of his family experiences which made him vulnerable to bullying at school about which he complains. There is some information provided to the Court in relation to the stress created by bullying at school and the stress upon the people and consequences for people suffering some form of post-traumatic stress disorder. The relevance of this condition to matters germane to the offender’s circumstances is that the offender told the psychologist that it was, as a consequence of his early life experiences, that he turned to drug use to make himself feel better. That he incurred debts in relation to his drug use and that ultimately the debts in relation to his drug use:
	


“became too large for him to pay off and he was offered the opportunity to come to Australia to set up a drug operation and this would wipe the debt”.


	
	The report says that he was:
	


“anxious about doing this but could see no way out of his predicament with the likely scenario of his demise or his family being hurt if he did not pay the debt.”


	
	If that aspect of the history, referring to what is sometimes described in sentenced “non-exculpatory duress”, that is duress that is relevant to the sentencing exercise not relevant to the issue of criminal liability, then it is an account that I cannot rely upon nor regard as truthful. It is a matter that is insufficient in the form in which it is presented to the Court to provide a basis for concluding that a relevant mitigating factor was that the offender acted “non-exculpatory duress”. The account is entirely unexaminable.
	
	
	I do not need to go into the particular judgment in chapter and verse, but the judgment of Johnson J, in a case of Ticknius, discussed in some detail the relevant considerations that arise when the issue of non-exculpatory duress is sought to be relied upon. It must be said in the discussion that I had with learned counsel for the offender it was not pressed that it was a matter that I could find in favour of the offender in this particular sentencing exercise in any event. But Johnson J noted amongst other things that such claims often made must be approached with considerable circumspection, bearing in mind that they are made about events that usually are alleged to have occurred overseas with no capacity for the prosecution, for example, to undertake any independent checking. Usually, as is the case here, there is no independent evidence to support the claim. Furthermore what history the offender has given the psychologist about the matter that he was offered the opportunity to come to Australia to “set up a drug operation” is not in accordance with the facts. The drug manufacture operation was actually set up, as I would understand it, by Mr Tsang by what I would regard as well planned means. That is by getting the offender and Ms Ng to join a tour group the offender entered in Australia to avoid suspicion in order to assist the drug manufacture process in a particular respect, that is by bringing his expertise to bear to convert liquid methylamphetamine to crystal-methylamphetamine.
	
	
	Now of course I am no expert on the manufacture of methylamphetamine, but I certainly have done enough trials relating to such matters to understand that there is a degree of expertise and knowledge required in order to successfully convert raw pre-cursors into methylamphetamine and also to convert methylamphetamine into crystalline form I bear in mind as the facts reveal the offender spoke knowingly to Tsang and to the man in China about the fact that the process that he had undertaken had not been successful and there was, it would seem to me, equal discussion between the offender and the man in China, particularly about what might be done to rectify the situation or why the situation had arisen. He gives no explanation for his acquisition of skill in this area.
	
	
	The fact that the offender asserts that he was a user of drugs is something that I do not discount. It may well be that he, because he is a user of a drug, that he is capable of “manufacturing” it at least to the extent that he was involved in this particular process. But that would seem to be little qualification by itself. I note in relation to the offender’s childhood experiences that the psychologist on two occasions refers to the conclusion he reaches about the existence of post-traumatic stress disorder as being “concluded in hindsight”. He states in the report that there is no evidence of the offender receiving any treatment in relation to drug usage or dependency. There is no evidence of any treatment of the offender in the past in respect of any mental health issues.
	
	
	The psychologist’s opinion so far as it goes reflecting upon the offender’s mental state at the relevant time is very much dependent, it would seem to me, upon the truthfulness of the account given by the offender. Not just as to the circumstances of his childhood but the relationship of that history to the offender’s use of drugs and then the circumstances in which the offender found himself, he claimed, in debt.
	
	
	Of course I could not be satisfied on balance that that account in its entirety is true. There are suggestions made for the offender’s assistance on his return to the community, including suggestions of a need for cognitive behaviour therapy, psycho-education in relation to negative thinking and mindfulness techniques, matters all addressed as I would understand it to the issue of his drug usage and the effects of the claim of trauma to which reference is made. But I cannot on the basis of all the material available to me and the circumstances in which it arises, conclude that there is material within the report that would warrant a diminution of weight to be given to general deterrence or any relevant weight to be given to personal deterrence.
	
	
	His counsel produced some statistics which show a range of penalties imposed in respect of 19 cases brought pursuant to section 24(2), where the quantity of the “amphetamines” was not less than the large commercial quantity. Of course there has been much criticism of the use to be had of those statistics, the decision of the High Court in Hili v R (2010) 244 CLR 520 and in Pham (2015) 256 CLR 550 reflected upon the limitations of the utility of statistics. In fact the Judicial Commission of New South Wales, in a recent ‘Bulletin’ prepared for the benefit of Judicial Officers, has noted that an additional enhancement of the sentencing statistics held by the Commission is being made to try and address some of the matters that have been referred to in the High Court.
	
	
	But that having been said the Court of Criminal Appeal on a number of occasions has noted the limitations of statistics. In 1998 Spigelman CJ, who was then new to the position, reflected upon the limitations of statistics in dealing with matters on appeal in the decision of Bloomfield. More recently decisions such as Knight v R [2015] NSWCCA 222, reflected upon the limitations of this utility. It seems to me based upon the statistics provided in this case they provide some indication of the range of penalties that have been imposed. But, of course, there are many variables that arise. Particularly issues relating to the role of the offender, the benefit to be received by the offender, the position the offender had in any particular hierarchy that can be identified and of course, most importantly the quantity of the drug in question.
	
	
	The quantity of the drug attempted to be manufactured in this particular matter is 88.5 kilograms which is very substantially greater than the minimum quantity that is required to be manufactured in order to commit an offence involving the manufacture or attempted manufacture of a large commercial quantity of the drug methylamphetamine.
	
	
	With regard to the matter I had helpful oral submissions from the parties and written submissions from the offender’s learned counsel. In relation to the written submissions of the defence provided to me I note the observation that Mr Mok’s role was a relevant matter for determining the objective seriousness of the offending. He was not the principal in this operation, which I accept. He was not involved in sourcing the precursors. Such was the “sophistication” of the operation that obviously the methylamphetamine had been imported into Australia without detection, at least as far as I am aware, or if it was detected it was permitted to be stored so Mr Tsang could have access to it. Mr Tsang was the person who had obviously organised the equipment for manufacture and any relevant other precursors for the manufacturing process. He also provided the equipment for the manufacture of the drugs. I accept the particular submission that the offender had been recruited as the methylamphetamine “cook”. Although clearly as the “cook” the offender had a vital role in the proposed process of manufacture.
	
	
	It is said that the offender did not know about any intended quantity to be manufactured. Clearly I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of an intention on his part to be involved in a process of manufacture of a quantity greater than that particularised in the indictment, I can only deal with the matter on the basis of the facts available to me. Clearly the police had interrupted the operation. But the extent to which the offender was to remain in Australia I do not know and certainly the offender did not assist me with the interview that he gave to the police in which he sought to mislead the police in respect of his involvement in this matter.
	
	
	The offender is described by his counsel as a “unsophisticated person”, a matter about which I can make no conclusion whatsoever either on the balance of probabilities in his favour, if it be a favourable matter, or beyond reasonable doubt if it be a matter that is required to be proven by the Crown that he is a “sophisticated person”. That being said, he certainly was familiar with the process of manufacture, being left by himself with Ms Ng to undertake it. Reference is made that he was a drug user. It is submitted in relation to the matter that he possess “no special skills” which were “not possessed by others involved in this manufacture”. The facts are largely ignorant in this regard and it would be a matter of speculation to conclude that he was the only person who had skills. I can only deal with the matter on the basis of what is proven against him beyond reasonable doubt as the facts made clear.
	
	
	The offender’s involvement in the manufacture is said to have deflected the risk of detection to himself as opposed to others. Well clearly on the basis of the facts available to me Mr Mok’s detection was already foreshadowed of course by the fact that Mr Tsang was under investigation. There is no suggestion of the material available to me that Mr Mok was held out by anybody else as a sort of sacrificial pigeon. It is not like a courier who is intercepted when police are well aware of a particular importing operation. The courier is clearly exposed. I would expect on the facts available to me that Mr Tsang and Mr Mok and Ms Ng, to the extent that she was involved in this matter, were completely unaware of the fact that they were subject of investigation at the relevant time. He was said to be “lowest in the hierarchy” and “always took instructions from those higher in the hierarchy”. I am prepared, on the basis of the evidence available to me, to conclude that he was to be seen at a lower level than Mr Tsang. Quite clearly and obviously people in China who might be regarded as the architects of this criminal enterprise. With the sentencing of offenders involved in drug importation matters, I am required to sentence him for what he did, rather than speculate about where he stood in the hierarchy which is largely unknown to me, I am prepared to accept that he was taking instruction from Mr Tsang and a man in China but it is also worthwhile to mention that insofar as the process of manufacture was concerned, and that is the principal matter with which I am concerned rather than the organisation that funded this affair, the offender was able to discuss matters, it seems, on equal footing with those that had an interest in the matter.
	
	
	His counsel submitted in the context of consideration of the standard non-parole period that I should find this offence as below the mid-range. This turns me to the submissions of the Crown in relation to this aspect of the matter because it is a very important matter in any sentencing exercise as to what is the particular role of the offender.
	
	
	The Crown’s submissions to me were that I should regard the role of the offender as being above the mid-range, or middle range, of objective seriousness, having regard to the quantity of the drug involved and the role of the offender, the importance of the offender in the actual process of manufacture. I have come to the conclusion in the context of accepting that the middle range of objective seriousness is not necessarily a “narrow band” that the offender’s objective criminality assessed by reference to section 54A of the Act, can be seen as at the lower level of the middle range of objective seriousness. But slightly above the cusp of that band as it has been sometimes described. The factors that I determine relevant to assessing this matter are as follows:
	
	
	Firstly the offender was, it would be apparent from the facts, employed as “the cook” not of the methylamphetamine itself because that was already in existence when the police seized it as a prohibited drug, but for the purpose of converting the imported methylamphetamine to that of crystalline-methylamphetamine. He had come from Hong Kong to supervise and undertake the process but at the direction of a “local manager” Mr Tsang with the input of those in China with whom he had contact. He consulted with and took direction from a person in China who clearly had a supervisory role over the offender and Mr Tsang.
	
	
	The offender did not finance the operation. The offender was to be regarded on the facts available to me as an “employee”. He did not set up the manufacturing process insofar as gathering and bringing materials to the apartment at Campsie. Although when the materials were brought to him, given what I would take to be his expertise in respect that he was involved he would have been required to put the relevant components together at the Campsie flat to enable the process to begin. He had independence in performing this task but was clearly answerable to Tsang and the Chinese person to whom I referred.
	
	
	I cannot conclude beyond reasonable doubt that he was to profit directly from the operation, but clearly he was to receive some sort of financial benefit, the extent of which I am unable to conclude.
	
	
	He had a colleague with him Ms Ng who was available to assist. Whether she was on equal footing with the offender or subject to his direction I am unable to say, I note the facts reveal that when the man from China rang at one point she passed the mobile phone to Mr Mok for him to conduct the relevant conversation about the process of manufacture. But it would appear that her presence in the apartment was for a purpose not entirely explained in the facts.
	
	
	Ultimately the prisoner’s role was that of an employee. But with a significant or vital role in a particular aspect of the process of manufacture. The quantity to be manufactured was a very substantial quantity by reference to what constitutes the minimum quantity to establish a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. I note in terms of the quantity that it was substantially greater than many of the comparative cases to which I was referred and it was potentially very valuable.
	
	
	I note the process was unsuccessful not from any lack of endeavour on the part of the prisoner but because of the police investigation. This is an aspect of the case that was the subject of particular submission by both the Crown and the defence and I will refer to some legal decisions that deal with this matter in a moment.
	
	
	Quantity of course is a very important consideration in determining where a particular offence fits within the range of objective seriousness. The quantity attempted to be manufactured whilst very, very substantial and considerably greater than the minimum quantity, is not the greatest quantity that could be manufactured in a particular individual process of manufacture. I also note that other matters important in determining the objective seriousness of offending of this type is the particular role of the offender where the person’s position stood in relation to other people who can be identified by reference to any particular “organisation” or “hierarchy”.
	
	
	Another relevant factor is what can be established as far as offender’s “financial benefit”. Whether the person was substantially to profit or was to benefit by a payment of “wages”, which if itself must be regarded as some profit. But there are other features of manufacture of prohibited drugs that are relevant to the assessment of the objective seriousness which do not arise here.
	
	
	People can be involved in the process of manufacture who themselves are going to be involved in the distribution of the drugs. There is no evidence that the offender had any role in that regard. Whether Mr Tsang was to be involved in that or whether some other person was waiting in the wings to take over that role to disseminate the drugs to the community, I do not know.
	
	
	I bear in mind by reference to section 21A(2) that it must be said that the Crown has established beyond reasonable doubt in all the circumstances that the offender was involved in an organised criminal activity. Obviously it was well-planned. But planning would be an inherent quality of any manufacturing of prohibited drugs of this type and in any event much the planning of the matter would have fallen to others not to the offender himself.
	
	
	It is in these circumstances weighing up all those matters that I have assessed where the offence sits in the context of the assessment of the matter by reference to section 54A(2) of the Act. The standard non-parole period represents the non-parole period for an offence on the Table of the Act taking into account only the objective factors affecting the relative seriousness of the offence that render the offence “in the middle of the range of seriousness”, section 54B(2) of the Act provides that the standard non-parole period for an offence is a matter to be taken into account by a Court in determining the appropriate sentence for an offender without limiting the matters that are otherwise required or permitted to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence of an offender. This now existing statutory provision reflects ultimately the findings made in the decision of Muldrock v R (2011) 244 CLR 120, particular at [19] - [30].
	
	
	As has been said in another context the standard non-parole period in all the circumstances provides “a guidepost”. It is clear, following upon Muldrock and the terms of the sections to which I referred, that these matters are to be taken into account as required from the decision of the High Court of Markarian [2005] HCA 25, particular for example the observations of McHugh J at [51] of judgment.
	
	
	Returning if I may to the matters that arise out of the submissions of counsel for the offender and the matters that are identified by Counsel for the Crown, reference is made to some decisions as “comparative” cases to which I might have regard. Those cases include S (2000)111 A Crim R 225, Pedavoli  (2002) 128 A Crim R 137, by the defence. There is a short summary provided in relation to the facts of those matters and I did have regard to them. I note in relation to those two matters referred to in the written submissions of the offender that they are sentences that pre-date the creation of a standard non-parole period in respect of the particular offence.
	
	
	With regard to other judgments that were brought to my attention I particularly note the decision of DW [2012] NSWCCA 66 and the decision of AB [2013] NSWCCA 273. In the decision of DW, Baston JA, in his judgment referred to one seemingly comparable case, that is the decision of El-Azzi [2004] NSWCCA 455. The judgment of R S Hulme J in that matter contains much more extensive reference to a number of supposedly “comparative cases” in respect of the issue of manufacture of prohibited drugs or attempted manufacture of prohibited drugs at [119] - [128].
	
	
	I do not propose to detail all the cases that his Honour referred to, but some of those include Thompson from 1999 and Spaliviero 1993. All judgments of course that pre-date standard non-parole periods. Then more latterly the decision of OPA [2004]NSWCCA 464, the decision of S, to which I believe I was referred by counsel for the offender and the decision of AD (2008) 191 A Crim R 409 which post-dates the introduction of standard non-parole periods.
	
	
	Comparative cases of course provide some assistance to a Court in giving indication of the range of penalties appropriate for particular offences. But again, as was mentioned in the High Court decision of Hili to which I referred, one must be cautious in using comparative cases. The facts objectively and subjectively will vary considerably, notwithstanding people have been sentenced in relation to the same provision.
	
	
	The decision of AB was a matter involving appeals against sentences imposed in relation to two groups of offences. I need not cite the exact facts but the particulars of the sentences and the offending as set out in that judgment at [3]-[40] I note in relation to AB that the relevant offence if I might call it that bearing in mind AB was sentence for a range of offences, was an offence concerned with the manufacture or the process of manufacture of MDA, a slightly different drug, had ascribed to it a discount of 50% for assistance and the plea of guilty. I also note AB whose appeal was dismissed I hasten to say, committed that offence whilst on bail in relation to earlier offences that involved, amongst other things, an explosion that caused him to be seriously injured. A relevant matter to that sentencing process. The offender committed the offence of involvement in the process of manufacture whilst on bail in relation to that earlier offending, but having said that as I understand it there was no finding that AB was involved in any organised crime network. Particularly AB had not come to Australia to commit a crime against our community.
	
	
	One matter that was specifically raised in the course of submissions through the parties was the fact that the police operation led to the fact that any drugs that were sought to be manufactured could not be disseminated. The process of manufacture was incapable of production of the relevant prohibited drug and the methylamphetamine that had apparently been imported into Australia had been seized by the police. R S Hulme J in DW discusses these matters at [107] - [117] Hulme J came to the conclusion on considering the various authorities that, from [117]:
	


“I have no difficulty in accepting that absent circumstances where criminality has been exacerbated by or at the instigation of authorities, the circumstance that the authorities have been complicit in offending or have prevented drugs from being disseminated in the community in no way mitigates the subject criminality of the offender. However if the involvement of the authorities prevents the transaction from resulting in harm it is illogical not to afford that fact appropriate weight, just as in the converse situation one would take into account of any damage that was a consequence of the offending. Insofar as the authorities to which I have referred suggest the contrary, or that the significance of the absence of dissemination of the community is slight or “very minor” they are in my view wrong.”


	
	Earlier in his judgment he referred to a number of authorities where various senior Judges particularly Latham J, Rothman J and Johnson J in a number of authorities referred to the view to be taken of the fact that by reason of police intervention the relevant prohibited drug either in the context of supply or in the process of manufacture had not been disseminated.
	
	
	Latham J held, for example, in the decision of Gao, [2007] NSWCCA 343, that in the context of the supply being interrupted by an undercover operative and thus not finding their way into the community, the “objective gravity of the offences was diminished accordingly, albeit slightly”.
	
	
	In the same judgment Rothman J said, at [47] - [48], where there is an undercover operation that is beneficial to the community in that the drugs are not able to be used, the benefit is as a result of the actions of law enforcement agencies not the result of any intention or action of the person charged. There are no victims to such dissemination and that may be a factor like others, that a sentencing Judge takes into account. But for his own part his Honour thought “I would not generally regard it as ‘significant’”.
	
	
	Johnson J’s view in the judgment of Hristovski [2010] NSWCCA 129, particularly at [41], was that the fact the drugs would not be disseminated into the community because of police activity “does not materially assist the applicant”.
	
	
	The applicant in that matter “intended that the drugs would be disseminated into the community and it was no act that the applicant stood in the way of such dissemination”.
	
	
	There appears to be three positions identified at least in that judgment of DW. I would take the view expressed by Latham J and Rothman J, expressed in different ways of course, that in this particular matter there is some diminution of the objective gravity of the offending by reason of the fact that there has been no harm caused, albeit by the work of the police, not through any intention of the prisoner and that matter is not to be regarded as “significant”. Thus the matter operates slightly in favour of the offender but not significantly.
	
	
	I should in fairness to the learned Crown’s position in assessing the objective gravity of the offender note that apart from submitting the offending was above the mid-range, particular by reference to the quantity, the Crown noted that it was a well organised criminal enterprise which I accept, although not organised by Mr Mok.
	
	
	The Crown accepted that the offender was acting as a “cook” but that he operated with some independence and I accept that that is so, as I have already outlined. The Crown’s particular submission was that the fact that the drugs were not manufactured and thus were not capable of causing harm to the community did not reduce the objective seriousness of the offending. As I said the matter is not “significant matter”. The Crown also made submissions about non-exculpatory duress to which I have earlier made reference.
	
	
	Turning to the subjective matters that arise in this case, noting what has been put by his learned Counsel. Firstly, if the offender be a drug user it is not a matter of mitigation in this particular matter and of course drug use usually is not a matter of mitigation although it is relevant usually in sentencing in a range of ways, for example as described by Wood J in the guideline judgment of Henry from 1998, particularly at [273] of that judgment. I accept however by reference to section 21A(3) of the Act that the offender did not have any record of previous convictions. Whilst he obviously had some experience as a methylamphetamine cook before he arrived in Australia, by reason of the fact that he had no prior convictions and had some history of industry I am prepared to accept that he was to a limited extent a person of “good character”.
	
	
	I am unable to conclude whether he is likely to reoffend because I really do not know enough about his future in Hong Kong and the extent to which he is imbued with the qualities required of people who are members of organised criminal activity or enterprises.
	
	
	So far as his prospects of rehabilitation I am not prepared to conclude that he has good prospects of rehabilitation. Again I do not know enough about his circumstances to be able to make a prediction about that, although I do accept that this being his first term of imprisonment will be a salutary experience for him.
	
	
	The offender has pleaded guilty which is a fact to be acknowledged as a mitigating factor, although he receives a discrete discount for that. He has expressed remorse through the psychologist’s report. He has not given evidence, I can understand a man in his position being reluctant to give evidence, there are matters of course, well-known to the Court that would constrain somebody in the offender’s position from coming to the witness box, a fear of having to disclose matters within his knowledge, may operate to prevent him taking that course.
	
	
	I am prepared, although the evidence might on one view of it be seen as tenuous, to conclude that there is remorse reflected in the plea and his acknowledgement of remorse through the psychologist which is I accept limited.
	
	
	Of course in sentencing any offender pursuant to this particular provision with a life sentence maximum penalty, by reference to the purposes of sentencing under section 3A as I have mentioned, particular weight is required to be given to general and personal deterrence. The offender is to be adequately punished, he is to be made accountable for his conduct, he is to be denounced for his conduct as the section requires. I am also required under the section to promote his rehabilitation, although his rehabilitation of course will occur offshore. I am required to fix a sentence that involves consideration of a non-parole period as if, bearing in mind it turns out to be a fiction, he was a person who would be subject to parole supervision in New South Wales, which of course will not occur.
	
	
	I have concluded in the context of him serving a term of imprisonment for the first time, requiring in my view some professional assistance to adjust to community living and to assist him in relation to his drug usage, that there are ‘special circumstances’ pursuant to s.44 of the Act and there should be some adjustment of the relationship of the non-parole period to the balance of sentence to reflect those special circumstances.
	
	
	I have taken into account and I accept that because of his limited English language his isolation from his family, the fact that he is a foreign national, that there will be aspects of his custody which will make his time in prison in Australia more difficult than they may be for people who have family connections in Australia or greater support than the offender has.
	
	
	Whether the offender is receiving any support from family members or friends in Hong Kong is not known to me. But I do accept that the offender has language difficulties. He is not conversant in the English language particularly and will find his time in custody difficult. Particularly in the context of being separated from persons who, if they lived locally would be able to visit him of course. I accept the fact that by the time he finishes his sentence in Australia, his skills in English will be much improved through his incarceration.
	
	
	The sentencing of the offender requires the Court to ensure that he is prevented from committing further offences. It is highly unlikely that the offender will be committing further offences in Australia and of course the fact that he has been arrested and convicted in Australia will make it quite difficult for him to travel from his native Hong Kong in the future.
	
	
	There is one aspect of his prior good character that needs to be taken into account, or at least the absence of convictions, and that is that it was the absence of convictions that would have permitted him to come into Australia in the first place, to be available to involve himself in the process of manufacture, that aspect of the matter has not been lost to me.
	
	
	Thus, in all the circumstances of the matter taking into account all the evidence and having regard to the submissions of the parties I have concluded that the starting point of any sentence I impose should be that of 12 years with a discount for the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty. The sentence to be imposed in respect of this matter should be nine years imprisonment. Given the finding of special circumstances I fix a non-parole period of six years.
	
	
	Could you stand up please Mr Mok.
	
	
	In relation to the matter to which you pleaded guilty you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of six years imprisonment to be served by way of a non-parole period, that will commence on 25 January 2016 and expire on 24 January 2022. In respect of that sentence I fix a balance of sentence of three years, that will expire on 24 January 2025.
	
	
	You can take a seat thank you. Yes madam Crown are there matters.
	
	
	SWEENEY: Nothing your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Mr Coyle?
	
	
	COYLE: Nothing your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Thank you, madam interpreter can you ask the prisoner if he understands the sentence I have imposed?
	
	
	INTERPRETER: Yes.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: You will be eligible for release to parole as I told you at the beginning on 24 January 2022, whether you are released to parole will depend upon the decision of the parole authority, your behaviour in custody and other matters. Ultimately you will be deported back to Hong Kong.
	
	
	Thank you madam interpreter for your assistance, you are excused thank you. You are excused Mr Mok. Thank you gentlemen very much I wish you both a very good weekend.

		13 November 2017",2017-10-12 00:00:00,NSW District Court
6454000,"R v JERKIC, Ricky [2017] NSWDC 317","SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: The prisoner, Ricky Jerkic, appears today for sentence in relation to a number of offences. The first offences in time being committed on 29 May 2016 or thereabouts. The principal offence is an offence of breaking, entering and stealing property contrary to s 112(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900, which carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. There is no standard non‑parole period.
	
	
	There are two matters on a Form 1 attaching to that principal offence committed on 29 May 2016. Taking and driving a conveyance without the consent of the owner, which ordinarily if dealt with on indictment would carry a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment, and a second offence of dishonestly obtaining property by deception which, if dealt with on indictment, would carry a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment. Although I would imagine these two matters on a Form 1 would have ordinarily in the course of matters, but for the principal offence, be dealt with in the Local Court.
	
	
	The second group of offences were committed on 1 June 2016. They comprise two breaking, entering and stealings, one offence involving stealing property greater than a value of $60,000 and a second breaking, entering and stealing involving the stealing of property valued less than $60,000. These are offences with the same maximum penalty arising out of the same provision as I earlier outlined, that is 14 years imprisonment with no standard non‑parole period.
	
	
	There is a further offence of resisting an officer in the execution of his duty contrary to s 58 of the Crimes Act 1900 that carries, when dealt with on indictment, a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment.
	
	
	Attaching to the principal offence, which is the breaking, entering and stealing offence where property greater than $60,000 was taken, I am required to take into account two matters on a Form 1. An offence of larceny. That offence, it must be said, committed on 18 May 2016, and another offence of breaking, entering and stealing committed on 26 May 2016 according to the cover sheet.
	
	
	The details of the specific offences I will come to in a moment. The breaking, entering and steal matter on a Form 1 of course, when dealt with on indictment or dealt with by committal for sentence, would carry a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment.
	
	
	The prisoner was committed for sentence from the Local Court in February 2017 and thus in relation to each offence for sentence I propose to accord the offender a discount of 25% to represent the utilitarian benefit of the pleas of guilty in accordance with the guideline judgment from 1999/2000 of Thomson and Houlton. There appears no dispute about that.
	
	
	I should point out the prisoner was born on 17 November 1988 and thus at the time of the commission of the offences with which I am concerned, as I would calculate his age, he was 27 years of age. He is a Queensland resident normally. In fact he had lived in Queensland up until, it would seem, around about 2014 when, after release from prison, he came to New South Wales and committed the offences with which I am concerned and other offences that are reflected in his criminal history.
	
	
	The offender was on parole in New South Wales at the time of the offending with which I am concerned. But it seems as though from the pre‑sentence report and other information the offender’s parole had been revoked. Not for the offences with which I am concerned, but because for reasons I will deal with in dealing with subjective circumstances. He failed to report to the parole authorities and failed to comply with their lawful directions, thus a breach report was filed when he was unable to be contacted and when he came into custody in relation to the current matters parole was revoked.
	
	
	He was arrested on 1 June 2016 shortly after the commission of the offences that are described in the Crown cover sheet as the “second offences”; that is the two breaking and enterings and stealings of 1 June and the resisting the police officer in the execution of his duty. However, he was required to serve a balance of parole which required him to be in custody, as I understand it, in respect of that revocation of parole for one month and 21 days. If the balance of parole that he was required to serve had been a lengthier period of time I would have approached the matter somewhat differently.
	
	
	I am mindful of the 2006 Court of Criminal Appeal decision of Callaghan, particularly the decision of Simpson J. This is a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal where her Honour surveyed the authorities that dealt with the situation where there was an extensive balance of parole to be served upon revocation of parole and where particular offences for sentence involved a breach of that parole which was revoked. She, by reference to the authorities, cautioned against the “double-dipping” that is involved when finding as an aggravating factor in relation to the offending pursuant to s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, that the offences were offences committed in breach of conditional liberty, but then seeking to accumulate any sentences imposed upon the balance of parole served.
	
	
	In other words as an aggravating factor breach of conditional liberty requires consideration of increasing the appropriate sentence the offender is also penalised by the order accumulating upon the balance of parole in its entirety. The discretion is wide, of course, in this regard. But ordinarily where the balance of parole is an extensive period of time one would commence any further sentences sometime into the balance of parole, recognising, as her Honour pointed out, the fact that if a person was on parole and their parole was revoked, they would still be eligible to be released to parole during the course of the balance of the sentence at the discretion of the Parole Authority.
	
	
	But here the parole served was one month and 21 days and I believe I can reflect the effect of the accumulation in the fixing of the non‑parole period by a finding of ‘special circumstances’ pursuant to s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. On that topic, perhaps getting ahead of myself in terms of the material I have to cover, I have concluded that I should make a finding of ‘special circumstances’ in the fixing of the non‑parole period. Putting aside the issue of accumulation upon the balance of parole that has already been served, there will be some partial accumulation within the sentences that I impose and that partial accumulation of itself is a “special circumstance”.
	
	
	If the offender were released to parole in New South Wales having regard to the report of the Community Correction Service, I believe he requires an extension of the balance of the sentence to provide proper support for his integration into the community and to receive appropriate direction and counselling in relation to the underlying issue to his offending, and that is his long entrenched drug dependency.
	
	
	However, on that matter there is a complication. The complication is that the offender’s parole in Queensland has been revoked and the offender anticipates that on his release from custody in New South Wales he will be extradited to Queensland to serve the balance of the parole. In this particular matter the learned Crown Prosecutor has endeavoured to assist me with his understanding of the Queensland provisions. Unlike in New South Wales where parole is revoked, when a person is returned to custody they have to serve the full balance of parole at the time of the revocation. My understanding of the system in New South Wales is that does not necessarily arise.
	
	
	But he also understands that if parole is revoked a person may be further released to parole during the course of what we in New South Wales would call the “balance of the sentence”. As I am expecting, from what I have been told, the offender will be required to go back to Queensland and serve a further time in custody to my mind that is a relevant matter to take into account, albeit marginally, in consideration of fixing of a non‑parole period which ordinarily would anticipate his release to the community.
	
	
	It is possible that when he is released to parole in New South Wales, assuming that he is released on the non‑parole period expiry date that I fix, he may end up serving another 11 months and some days in Queensland which would only leave slightly more than a year of the balance of sentence that I fix to be served under parole conditions. I would expect the New South Wales authorities would request the Queensland authorities to enforce the parole conditions that will be required.
	
	
	Turning, however, to the facts of the matters with which I am concerned, I have a very detailed fact sheet and it is not necessary for me to repeat all of it. The first tranche of matters all arose on 29 May 2016; the facts presented to me are in error in that regard. The offender made an incursion in the early hours of the morning at premises at Burraneer in the Sutherland Shire. The premises were the subject of a renovation at the time. It was the early hours of the morning. The prisoner was wearing some sort of hooded jacket and shorts. He used a screwdriver to force open a kitchen window and stole a quantity of property inside the premises, a Gucci bag valued at $2,700, inside which there was a MasterCard debit card, American Express credit card and a Visa credit card in her name. He also took earrings and a Christian Dior watch valued at $5,000 and an iPad that was not password protected and two sets of keys.
	
	
	I pause for a moment to point out that in the written submissions of the Crown it is said at para 13, “In the first break and enter property valued over $7,000 was taken.” I would be very appreciative from now on if representatives of the Crown could get the relevant information as to the total value of property stolen in such a case put into the facts, rather than leaving it for the judge to speculate as to the total value of property that has been taken or to have to do the arithmetic him or herself. I am prepared to accept the figure from the Crown’s submissions. But it should, as I say, be in the facts so that it is there for all to see.
	
	
	While in the house the prisoner took a set of keys for a blue Honda Civic motor vehicle and a set of keys for another vehicle. He used the keys for the blue Honda Civic motor vehicle to drive that car away from the property. Later on that morning he used the American Express credit card to buy a cheap meal at McDonald’s, and then the cards that he stole were used between 6am and 7.26am to make online purchases and transfer cash to a total value of $5,058, of which $3,363 and a few odd cents was apparently refunded by the relevant financial institutions.
	
	
	The motor vehicle was eventually located after the prisoner, I assume, had been arrested in early June at a place where he had “hidden it”. A drink container found inside the vehicle was tested and the DNA profile of the prisoner was identified from a swab taken from the drink container. They are the offences in the first group of offences with which I am concerned.
	
	
	The second group of offences, the three offences committed on 1 June, involved the prisoner being in the vicinity of properties in Church Point at the other end of Sydney up near Pittwater. The first break and enter involved the prisoner entering the premises of a Ms Greneger in the morning at about 10.30am. She had recently returned from her mother’s funeral and was obviously in a distressed state. She became aware that somebody was in the property in which she resided, her dogs were barking and the like, and she at the time I believe had a relative staying with her. A dog was barking.
	
	
	She discovered that her house had been “violated” and she eventually, after getting a glimpse of someone fleeing the premises, found that her bedroom had been ransacked, her handbag and wallet opened, drawers and other items strewn around the room. The missing items were a number of designer watches totalling $40,900 in value, which apparently were later recovered, credit cards in her name, two bags with a total value of $4,650, jewellery to a value of $5,800, a pair of sunglasses worth $200, a rare coin collection valued at between $25,000 and $30,000, and a set of keys for a Range Rover motor vehicle. Ms Greneger was affected “quite seriously” by the incident, and certainly it compromised her sense of security.
	
	
	I am told by the Crown that the designer watches were recovered, the offender being arrested a short time after the offence. But the other property was not recovered. Where it is I do not know. The prisoner certainly does not have it unless he has hidden it somewhere for when he is finally released from custody. Certainly the Range Rover keys would be no good to him. The matters of true value, one would have thought, were the bags, the jewellery and the coin collection. In any event I am told they were not recovered, for reasons I do not know.
	
	
	Later that same day the offender had broken and entered a property nearby that belonged to another family. He went into one of the bedrooms and there took a watch valued at $5,500, some after shave, a number of coins, a Mastercard in the name of Williams Reeves(?) and two credit cards in the same name. He moved some guitars that were in the premises and he put an old Nokia phone belonging to Mr Reeves on a charger for some reason. I assume he must have been disturbed in some way. Obviously he was going to probably use the mobile phone at a later time. He put some of Mr Reeves’ clothing in a backpack and left those items at the corner of the Reeves’ verandah. The property was returned to the victims.
	
	
	The prisoner left the Reeves’ property, but by this stage the police were called and he was chased by police. Initially the prisoner feigned exhaustion, telling the officer who had come across him that he was “stuffed”. As the officer who found him was about to put him into handcuffs, the offender pushed past him and began to run down the road again, causing the officer to drop the handcuffs, fall over and graze the palms of both his hands. He chased after the offender and eventually the prisoner was subdued and handcuffed. The police officer attended hospital for treatment of the grazes. Various items were found in his property, including the car key belonging to Ms Greneger.
	
	
	An ambulance was called when the prisoner complained of chest pains. He had provided at that stage a number of different false names. An item was found in his possession with the name Ricky Jerkic, and a check of that name revealed the parole revocation warrant outstanding in New South Wales. When questioned in hospital about what he had done earlier that day, the prisoner stated,
	


“I checked and no-one was home. I saw about 50 Louis Vuitton handbags so I thought ‘Why not’. I didn’t hurt anyone. It was stupid, I know”.


	
	Later that afternoon in a separate incident the prisoner, who they thought might have had a urinary tract infection, was taken to a toilet. He started to run away again when he was released from handcuffs, but was quickly subdued and taken to Manly Police Station.
	
	
	In relation to the offences on the Form 1, the matter of larceny was an offence committed on 18 May 2016 when the prisoner broke into a person’s car and stole a smart phone valued at $500. His blood was found and the DNA profile from that blood was matched with that of the prisoner. The prisoner was spoken to about this offence on 13 June 2016. It turned out that the victim of that offence had some connection with the prisoner.
	
	
	The other break, enter and steal matter on the Form 1 that is attached to the principal offence of breaking into Ms Greneger’s property was an offence committed at Kingsgrove during the day, it would appear, of 26 May 2016. CCTV footage from within the premises depicted the prisoner entering the property through a rear sliding door. He stole a phone valued at about $100 and it turned out that that person was the prisoner. By comparison with the other break, enter and steal matters it was a very minor matter, but still a violation of the privacy of the victims. That is from the statement of facts, an outline of the offending of the prisoner.
	
	
	The Crown has produced a criminal history of the prisoner and it is a very melancholy document to read. The offender comes from Queensland and has an extensive history in Queensland going back many years to 2003 when he would have been approximately 14 or 15 years of age. Apart from appearances in the Children’s Court involving offences of burglary and entering premises, theft and the like, he has convictions in the Townsville Magistrate’s Court for assault occasioning actual bodily harm, he has convictions in the Townsville District Court in March 2008 for entering a dwelling with intent by breaking in at night, burglary and committing indictable offences, 12 charges in all, six charges of stealing, attempted unlawful use of a motor vehicle, et cetera, et cetera. The offences for which he was dealt with on that occasion I have not totalled, but they occupy almost two columns of the Queensland record. In respect of all the principal charges he was imprisoned for four years and six months and had various other terms of imprisonment, disqualifications and the like imposed. He was fixed to be eligible for parole on 31 July 2009. He came back after being released from custody to be convicted at the Southport District Court in 2012 for robbery whilst armed, or pretending to be armed, with an offensive weapon and was sentenced to two years and six months imprisonment.
	
	
	He was also convicted and sentenced in relation to a large number of other offences including burglary and commit indictable offence on a number of occasions, unlawful entry of a motor vehicle, receiving stolen property, fraud, dishonestly obtaining property from another and a large number of charges of dishonesty which either attracted terms of imprisonment or, I understand, to run concurrently with the two years six months imposed for the robbery matter. He was deemed to be eligible for release to parole on 28 March 2014. The other convictions in Queensland I need not dilate upon, but he does have other findings of guilt in Queensland.
	
	
	This brings us to his New South Wales history. It would appear that he was charged in August 2014 in Tweed Heads with taking and driving a motor vehicle without consent on two occasions, and breaking, entering and stealing on two occasions on 1 May 2011. These were obviously offences for which warrants awaited him in New South Wales. He was convicted and sentenced to a total of 15 months imprisonment to date from 3 April 2014 with a non-parole period of nine months commencing on that date.
	
	
	Trying to marry up the dates between the Queensland history and the New South Wales history is something of a challenge. But as I would best understand it he was eligible for release to parole on 28 March 2014 and was arrested in relation to these matters a few days later. It is possible that he was extradited to New South Wales for those matters. They certainly were matters committed before he was sentenced in Queensland for the robbery matter and the related charges.
	
	
	He was released to parole, as inevitably he would have been with that term of imprisonment, on 2 January 2015, but he was charged on 17 January 2015, that is within a few weeks of release, in respect of an offence committed on 7 January 2015 of driving whilst disqualified. He was also convicted of breaking, entering and stealing, entering a dwelling with intent to steal, dishonestly obtaining property by deception on two occasions, taking and driving a motor vehicle without consent, dishonestly obtaining financial advantage by deception. As I understand the matter he was sentenced to a total sentence of 18 months imprisonment to date from 17 January 2015 with a non-parole period of 12 months concluding 16 January 2016. Some of the sentences imposed ran concurrently with that effective sentence.
	
	
	I should also say his record reveals that when he was dealt with in Tweed Heads there were other offences committed in 2011 relating to a police pursuit, assaulting police, using an offensive weapon to prevent lawful apprehension and other matters for which sentences of imprisonment were imposed.
	
	
	The last sentence of imprisonment imposed in New South Wales before today meant that he was eligible for release to parole on 16 January 2016. In this regard I now turn to the Community Corrections record which was tendered today and which I ordered on the last occasion. That report sets out the fact that his first contact with Community Corrections in New South Wales was entirely unsuccessful. He failed to report for interviews, he failed to reside in any approved address, he re-offended, and he was back in custody within two weeks of his release.
	
	
	On his release to parole supervision in January 2016 he was somewhat more successful. He firstly completed a residential rehabilitation program, or at least one phase of it, and was moved to a “programs exit house” which I take to be ‘Glebe House’. Today his counsel has produced an affidavit annexing a body of material taken from Corrections’ case notes. These case notes confirm the history the prisoner has given to a psychologist and confirm what is said in the pre-sentence report. His initial response was satisfactory, he seemed to be making progress, he seemed to be proud of his progress and there was family interest supporting his progress. However when he became aware that there was an outstanding warrant in Queensland, he went back to the use of prohibited drugs and it was in this context that he committed the offences over a period of 12 days or so that I have outlined.
	
	
	I pause for a moment to point out that the prisoner must have known that eventually he would be required to go back to Queensland in respect of the parole that he was in breach of given the events in New South Wales.
	
	
	In respect of his time in custody since June 2016 he has been the subject of a number of internal misconduct charges. Some of these matters are not matters of great moment to my mind. Internal conduct charges do not have the status of criminal convictions. But he does have a finding against him in relation to refusing to give a sample for drug testing. The Crown has brought me up to date with his Corrections record which is now part of the Crown bundle which shows a finding against him in mid-September for possessing a drug. Whether it is the same matter referred to in the pre-sentence report or not I do not know. Certainly the pre-sentence report is dated 28 September 2017. It could be the same matter.
	
	
	The Community Corrections report gives some family history, some dysfunction in the family of which the offender speaks in the psychologist’s report, his mother’s difficulties with alcohol. He has had little employment since he was 18 years of age. Most of the time since his 18th birthday has been spent in custody, either in Queensland or New South Wales. He, when at large, is usually in receipt of unemployment benefits. He had a dislocated or disrupted educated, claiming to have attended ten primary schools and three high schools. He barely completed year 8 at high school.
	
	
	He has been a user of illicit drugs since he was 13 and particularly in recent times he has been heavily dependent upon amphetamine type drugs. He was using crystal methylamphetamine in May 2016 and he claimed to be under the influence of that drug at the time of the commission of each of the offences. He had been abstinent during his residential rehabilitation program but had lapsed in the circumstances I have outlined of the news that he may be required to return to custody in Queensland. It seems to my mind a rather strange situation where someone goes back to drug use because of that news with the inevitable consequence that they will commit more offences which will lead to further periods of incarceration.
	
	
	He is said to have taken responsibility for his offending and made acknowledgements of the incursion on the privacy of the victims and expressed interest to seek assistance on his release. He is considered to be of medium to high risk of re-offending. He has a number of what are called criminogenic needs, including attention to education and employment, his financial circumstances, proper use of his leisure time, alcohol and drug issues, and his general attitude and orientation.
	
	
	The report states that he still has the support of his family and that he wished to engage in treatment in due course. Everyone I have ever seen that comes to court here who has committed offences when affected by drugs or when dependent upon drugs, makes the claim that they are anxious to engage in treatment on their release. So one must approach such claims with considerable circumspection.
	
	
	In relation to the parole situation in Queensland, there is attached to the Community Corrections Service a record of his performance in Queensland which is to be fairly said according to this document very desultory and uninspiring.
	
	
	The prisoner’s legal representatives prepared for the Court, through Anna Robilliard, a well-respected forensic psychologist, a psychological report. The prisoner’s personal background I need not dwell upon. There was family dislocation, separation between his parents when he was five, disruption to his education. It would seem that his father was the more stable of the two parents, but they both continue to support him. He has little in the way of employment history according to information available to the psychologist. He did some work with his father for about eight months when he was 15 years of age and that has been his longest period of employment.
	
	
	He has been Hepatitis C positive for about eight years and is required to address that matter at some point. He has no history of mental health issues. He has a long history of use of drugs as I have pointed out. He was impressed with the rehabilitation program he entered in early 2016 and the history gives the psychologist, who is in accord with other evidence available to me, that he progressed well for probably the first time in his life whilst subject to parole or probation until such time that the fact he was wanted in Queensland had been communicated to him.
	
	
	In relation to his psychological testing he is of average IQ. He has a composite IQ between 88 and 102, so his score in that regard would be equal to or better than 32% of the general population. The Risk Assessment and Management section of the report notes that with the application of the actuarial tool available to the psychologist he is assessed at a ‘high risk’ of reoffending. He has achieved significant scores on measures of anti‑social personality problems; historical problems of disturbed childhood behaviour which is a strong indicator of longer criminogenic risk, which is reflected in his criminal history.
	
	
	In the summary that was provided by the psychologist, the psychologist is unable to identify what triggered the prisoner’s early attraction to substance misuse. There was some evidence of peer influence; one can see the seeds of his addiction in family disruption and dislocation, interruption to his education and the like. The psychologist reflects upon the character of addiction. The psychologist noted in the interview that he presented with frustration and distress at the circumstances of his life and the addiction that he had been subject to up until recently.
	
	
	The prisoner advised her that he realised that he needed to go back to a process of rehabilitation and recovery. Again, I understand him making those noises, but the truth of the matter is his capacity to address these issues will be really dependent upon his attitude when he is released from custody. Not his attitude when he comes forward for sentencing, trying to present the best of himself to the Court.
	
	
	He has had no face-to-face contact with his family for a number of years. He is highly motivated to return to Queensland and highly motivated to re‑establish himself with his family. The psychologist believed that he had some insight into his offending style and had some understanding of the need to address the underlying problems; but all in all, even allowing for the fact it is a psychologist’s report, there is nothing really significant in the character of psychiatric and psychological illness, disability, or disorder which reflects upon his offending.
	
	
	The prisoner also produced a letter of apology to the Court, which I have read. This letter is expressed in terms where the prisoner apologises to his victims, tries to explain the circumstances of his offending, and the reason for his failure to stay away from methylamphetamine before he began offending again. It is understood that these reasons are proffered and are probably true, but it does little to assist the prisoner to be identifying the fact that he is subject to lawful intervention has caused him to go back to drug use. He notes his very “quote lengthy and appalling criminal history” but he would wish both his victims and the community to know that he is remorseful.
	
	
	As far as his father is concerned, he wrote a short letter to the Court. He understands the difficulty that his son is in; he indicates that he would wish to assist him. He says that he has noticed “a big change in his attitude” over the last 12 or so months, and that he would support him on his release to the community.
	
	
	That constitutes the evidence available to me. It is a situation that is not uncommon in these courts. People that are drug addicted and drug dependent committing crimes it is claimed for the purpose of supporting their drug dependency. The facts of the matter are, as the Crown’s written submissions make clear, that violations of the private homes of people are matters of which the Courts are rightly concerned to ensure that matters of general and personal deterrence are given appropriate weight.
	
	
	The Crown’s written submissions identify old authority from 1984 in the judgment of Lee J that the “invasion of people’s homes” and the “plundering” of their property is a social evil which the community looks for protection from law enforcement officers and the criminal courts. So said the Court of Criminal Appeal in the 1984 decision of Hayes. Heavy sentences are required in respect of offences committed on domestic premises by repeat offenders, and this offender from his Queensland and New South Wales history is clearly a repeat offender.
	
	
	On the other hand, the very decision the Crown cites of Harris, along with the decision of Huyn and the like, noted of course that breaking, entering and committing a serious indictable offence is concerned with a range of offending, not just stealing. Amongst serious indictable offences, stealing is not the most serious indictable offence that the section contemplates.
	
	
	The defence submissions in fact - if I might just pass to them in the context of assessing the criminality of the offender - noted a number of features that were discussed in the “guideline” judgment of Ponfield [1999] NSWCCA 422, where Grove J very eloquently identified features of this offending which by and large found their way into the subsequently amended s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I accept from her submissions that the offences were not professionally planned, organised, or even executed; very little in the way of disguise, if any, certainly little in the way of protecting himself from identification.
	
	
	The offences were not committed at premises of the elderly, sick or disabled. In fact the prisoner had no knowledge of the people involved at the various properties; there were not accompanied by significant vandalism or significant property damage. There was one window frame that was damaged, but that is not significant property damage. There were no repeat incursions into the same premises. There were significant monetary and/or sentimental valued items that were taken, particularly at the premises of Ms Greneger, and it is to be fairly said that the offence at her place involved property that, on face value at least, was in excess of $80,000. A good part of that was recovered. But it is of little consolation to the victim to have that property taken from her.
	
	
	It is pointed out that one of the other offences was committed when the premises were “occupied”, but the prisoner has not been charged with any circumstance of aggravation that might otherwise be brought if it were established that he knew that people were inside the premises. There was no use of force or threat against any individual. These are matters identified in Ponfield and, as I said, there is the character of the serious indictable offence that is pleaded in respect of each offence contrary to s 112(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	With regard to the issue of the prisoner’s motivation, there is the excuse given by the prisoner of his drug dependency. In the guideline judgment of R v Henry & Ors (1999) 46 NSWLR 346, the Court held that drug dependency or addiction in armed robbery matters - and it is held also in relation to other offending - is not a mitigating matter (at [273]). It may have some relevance in other respects, though, as to the impulsivity of the offending and the extent of planning, the existence or non-existence of some circumstances of aggravation, the state of mind or the capacity of the offender to exercise judgment being amongst the matters relevant to the assessment of the objective facts.
	
	
	I do not regard these offences as “impulsive”. The offender was wandering in parts of Sydney that were not areas where he lived, and it would seem to me that he was wandering in areas of Sydney where he would take the opportunity, if it was available, to break into premises. That having been said, I would categorise his offending as “opportunistic” and certainly not “planned”. One offence was committed between 4am and 5am in the morning; clearly under cover of darkness he would expect to get away with that particular offence.
	
	
	As for his capacity to exercise judgment, whilst he claims to have been under the influence of drugs at the time and he may have been, he still had the presence of mind to choose property that was valuable, to take car keys, for example, in relation to the first principal offence, and to take the motor vehicle, drive it to McDonalds and then in the early hours of the morning, some time after 6.30, transfer a substantial sum of money for his own benefit from cards that he had access to. Likewise in relation to the offending on 1 June he was able to take property, store it in bags with a view to being able to carry it away, and he certainly had the presence of mind to feign exhaustion so that it would give him an opportunity to again get away from the grip of the police officer in the circumstances I have outlined.
	
	
	Wood J in Henry, parts of whose judgment I have already cited in the current context, went on to point out that drug dependency or addition may be relevant in relation to the subjective circumstances, the prospects of recidivism or rehabilitation, the circumstances in which the person came into drug dependency, where offenders were at the crossroads receiving special consideration and the like.
	
	
	So far as those matters are concerned that I have spoken about in Henry at [273], obviously, as his counsel concedes in her written submissions, the prospects of rehabilitation of this offender must be very guarded. A man who has been in and out of custody almost continuously since the age of 18, now 28 years of age, must be seen as at real risk of further offending. I have taken into account his expressions of wishing to turn a corner. For his sake and the community’s sake one would wish that to be so. But one could not accept such claims at face value; the proof of the matter will depend upon his performance when he is released from custody in due course.
	
	
	If I could just return to the Crown’s submissions if I may, I acknowledge the relevance of the maximum penalty in the context of the recognition of the maximum penalty as a yardstick of the seriousness of the offending.
	
	
	With regard to the issue of the degree of planning as it is identified by the Crown, I have indicated that I could not conclude that these were planned offences. They were clearly, in my view, opportunistic and I have taken into account the loss of property and the like.
	
	
	The Crown correctly identifies that all the offences were committed whilst the prisoner was on conditional liberty as an aggravating factor, and I have discussed that matter earlier.
	
	
	So far as his criminal history is concerned, I do not find that to be an “aggravating” factor, although he is getting very close to a finding being made in that regard. But his criminal history certainly does not entitle him to any particular leniency or any substantial leniency. His criminal history is indicative of his risk of reoffending.
	
	
	So far as the offending being aggravated as it was committed in the home of the victims, I would have thought, with respect to that submission, that it was at least implicitly or inherently an element of the offence that the offences were committed at the home of people. Breaking into dwelling houses, by definition, involves breaking into premises that are occupied by people, and I could not find that as an “aggravating factor” as the Crown submitted. It would be a case of “double dipping”.
	
	
	With regard to mitigating factors arising under s 21A(2), the Crown reflects upon his plea of guilty. The Crown correctly indicates that he is not entitled to a favourable finding so far as good character, his criminal history and the like. I could not conclude on balance that he has “good prospects of rehabilitation” at this point. I am prepared to find that the offending was not part of “planned or organised criminal activity”.
	
	
	Whilst I note his expression of regret and the like, I could not conclude ultimately that there is a finding or remorse available pursuant to s 21A(3)(i) of the Act such as to make that a mitigating factor. Although I acknowledge those matters are adverted to in his apology and in statements he made to the psychologist and the Community Corrections officer.
	
	
	I accept the submission of the defence in relation to the resist officer, that he is to be sentenced for that and not a more serious offence of causing actual bodily harm to the officer in accordance with s 60(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. I have taken into account the matters adverted to in the defence submissions from the judgment of Wood J in Henry.
	
	
	With regard to the issue of matters on a Form 1, which the Crown refers to as being part of the matrix of matters I am required to consider, I note what was said by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the guideline judgment in relation to matters on a Form 1 from 2002. In Attorney General’s Application (No 1) of 2002, (2002) 56 NSWLR 147, the Court held that the fact that there are matters to be taken into account on a Form 1, and here I have two Forms 1 in relation to two separate principal offences, means that greater weight should be given to the need for personal deterrence and the community’s entitlement to extract retribution.
	
	
	The Court held in that matter that “the entire point of the process” is to impose a longer sentence or perhaps to alter the nature of the sentence that would have been imposed if the principal offence was a sentence that stood alone. Sometimes the additional penalty may be small, sometimes it will be substantial, however the Court cautioned that the whole point of the process was to fix an appropriate sentence for the principal offence, bearing in mind that deterrence and retribution are entitled to be given greater weight than they might otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence alone.
	
	
	Of course I am required only to have regard to the maximum penalty for the primary offence as the yardstick for the sentence for the principal offence and it would be rarely appropriate for a sentencing judge to attempt to quantify the affect upon that sentence when taking into account Form 1 matters. Those various observations of the Court in that judgment may be found at [18]-[44].
	
	
	With regard to some of the submissions of the defence, I have taken into account, as is evident from what I have said earlier, the attempt of the prisoner on his second release to parole in New South Wales to come to grips with his drug dependency. It is of little comfort to the Court that he should relapse on the basis of information, that he must have expected to come from Queensland, that he was still wanted up there.
	
	
	The written submissions of his learned counsel today, Ms Williams, set out matters that I have already taken into account; the significance of his drug dependency, the continuing support of his family despite their dislocation, his lack of opportunity as a child, the absence of any mental health issue relevant to his offending. I have taken into account his capacity for rehabilitation, although his prospects of rehabilitation cannot be classified as a mitigating factor. There is a capacity there that will need to be tapped into and will need to be evidenced by the prisoner if his parole is to continue when he is released. I have taken into account the fact that he does need an extended period of supervision in the community, if it is possible for that to be given to him, in light of his situation in Queensland.
	
	
	I have determined, as I have earlier said, that there are ‘special circumstances’ in the matter pursuant to s.44 of the Act. I have tried to give regard as best I can to the impending return to Queensland.
	
	
	Reference was made in the submissions to the High Court judgment of Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59. In that judgment the High Court of Australia adopted what had been said by the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in the decision of Todd concerning the affect upon sentencing in New South Wales for stale offences of the fact that an offender had in the intervening period since the earlier offending spent time in another jurisdiction’s gaol. The matters adverted to in Todd and discussed in Mill at pp.65 to 66 of the judgment do not arise here. The situation in Queensland is one that awaits the prisoner. But as I have earlier acknowledged the fact that he will be required to return to Queensland will have an effect upon the practicality of the non‑parole period that I fix.
	
	
	There is one other matter that arises out of Mill that is relevant to this sentencing exercise and it touches upon a matter raised in the submissions of the Crown. This is the issue of totality of sentencing which was discussed by the High Court in Mill at 62-64 of that judgment. In 1998 the High Court, by majority, in the decision of Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610, particularly at [45], held, and it has since been common and proper sentencing practice, that in sentencing for multiple offences a Court is required to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence calling for sentence and then turn one’s attention to the issue of totality, which includes determining the extent of concurrency an accumulation or partial accumulation as the case may be.
	
	
	This issue has received a great deal of attention from the Court of Criminal Appeal since then. In 2000 Simpson J in the decision of Hammoud discussed the issue of fixing appropriate sentences for multiple offences, even if the offences are not committed at the same time. There have been a number of other authoritative discussions on this matter. I need not cite those judgments.
	
	
	I have come to the conclusion to reflect the totality of criminality that there should be some partial accumulation of one set of sentences upon another. I have considered the issue of whether within the second set of offences, that is 1 June offences, there should be some further accumulation. To my mind in light of the extent of accumulation that I am proposing further accumulation is unnecessary to reflect the totality of the criminality, although I accept that it would be within my discretion to approach the matter that way and it is in those circumstances that I came to the conclusion, as I did ultimately, the total sentence to be imposed upon the prisoner should be one of five years, and with the finding of special circumstances the appropriate non‑parole period effectively should be two years and nine months.
	
	
	The prisoner will not be automatically eligible to be released to parole and of course there is the uncertainty as to what may happen to him in Queensland. Whilst I accept very much the great assistance of the learned Crown Prosecutor, both he and I are not in a position, nor is the defence, to effectively assist me as to what may happen in that regard with any particular precision.
	
	
	In sentencing the prisoner I have had regard to s 3A of the Act. Obviously in this matter there is a need to ensure adequate punishment, to give weight to general and personal deterrence, to protect the community from the offender to the extent that the offending requires such protection, to denounce his conduct, to recognise the harm done to the victims and to make him accountable for his actions. There is still a need, notwithstanding the fact that he is now 28, not a child anymore, to promote his rehabilitation. I do accept what his counsel said about the issue of “institutionalisation”. It seems to me with regret that process has already occurred or commenced, and ultimately it will be entirely a matter for the prisoner to make the decision whether he wants to continue going back into prison or not. One of the things that he should do in order to avoid going back into prison is to avoid use of prohibited drugs. It is for that purpose I have determined, amongst other things, that there should be a finding of ‘special circumstances’.
	
	
	In relation to the offence committed on 29 May 2016, taking into account the matters on the Form 1, you are convicted and you are sentenced to two years, six months imprisonment. That sentence is to commence on 22 July 2016 and expire on my calculation on 21 January 2019.
	
	
	In relation to the offence of 1 June 2016, taking into account the matters on the Form 1, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of one year and six months by way of a non‑parole period to commence on 22 September 2017, in other words accumulated upon the other sentence by one year and three months. That non‑parole period will expire on my calculation on 21 March 2019. I fix a balance of sentence in relation to that sentence of two years and three months, imprisonment expiring on 21 June 2021. But for the Queensland situation I would have made that non‑parole period one year and nine months, and the balance of sentence two years.
	
	
	In relation to resisting the police officer in the execution of his duty you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of nine months’ imprisonment to commence on 22 July 2017, expiring on 21 April 20118.
	
	
	In relation to the further offence of breaking, entering and stealing you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of non‑parole period of 18 months to commence on 22 September 2017, expiring on 21 March 2019, and in respect of that I fix a balance of sentence of one year, six months to expire on 21 September 2020. The balance of sentence for the sentence of three years and nine months expires on 21 June 2021.
	
	
	Yes, Mr Crown, are there any matters from you?
	
	
	SIT: No outstanding matters from the Crown.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Thank you. Ma’am, is there anything from you?
	
	
	WILLIAMS: Nothing further, thank you.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: The total sentence I have imposed on my calculation, Mr Jerkic, is five years imprisonment. That’s to date from the date that your balance of parole expired, 22 July 2016. You are eligible for release to parole on 21 March 2019. The balance of sentence is two years and three months, but whether you are released to parole on that date and what happens to you after that date I cannot say. Thank you, you’re excused. Thank you very much, Mr Crown, thank you very much for your assistance, Ms Williams, sorry to keep you back. I’m sorry, Mr Crown, Ms Williams, I’m just making sure all the orders have been typed up as I intended them to be. I mean I could have stood Mr Jerkic’s matter over to another date but I thought it best, in light of the history of the matter, to try and resolve it as quickly as I could.
	
	
	WILLIAMS: I’m grateful for your Honour for sitting on this afternoon.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I went back to get Mill v The Queen, amongst other things.

6454033,"R v CHAK, Yuk Nan; R v MAN, Michael Angelo; R v YEUNG, Shan Chiu [2017] NSWDC 315","SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: There are three men for sentence today. Their names are Yuk Nan Chak, Michael Angelo Man and Shan Chiu Yeung. The three men were effectively in a manner I will describe shortly, involved in a criminal enterprise or a series of criminal enterprises which occurred between 8 June 2016 and 20 June 2016 when they were each arrested. Their roles in relation to the enterprise or enterprises were different and it is quite clear on the facts that the totality of the criminality of Mr Chak is greater than that of Mr Man and Mr Yeung.
	
	
	As I will point out the evidence satisfies me that the three men had a connection with each other, that if it did not commence before they came to Australia, although it is the case that Mr Man and Mr Chak travelled to Australia together, it was a relationship set in place by others before they arrived in Australia.
	
	
	Mr Chak is for sentence in relation to seven offences of dealing with property reasonably suspected of being the proceeds of crime in that period between 8 June 2016 and 20 June 2016.
	
	
	These are offences contrary to section 400.9(1) Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). Each of the offences carries a maximum penalty of three years imprisonment and/or a fine of $32,400. The prisoner is as I understand it a citizen of Hong Kong and will, I would assume, be deported on the expiration of his sentence for the crimes that he has pleaded guilty to.
	
	
	In respect of the seven offences to which he has pleaded guilty the first offence in time occurring between 8 June 2016 and 13 June 2016 involved him dealing with $1,500,000. He committed an offence on or about 14 June 2016 in which he dealt with $800,000. He committed another offence on 15 June 2016 in which he dealt with $300,000. He committed an offence on 16 June 2016 in which he dealt with $500,000. He committed another offence on 17 June in which he dealt with $800,000. He committed another offence between 17 June 2016 and 18 June 2016 where he dealt with $300,000 and on 20 June 2016 he dealt with $500,000. All those sums of money “reasonably suspected of being proceeds of crime”.
	
	
	Mr Man has what could be called “common” charges to the accused for example sequence 1, an offence of reasonably suspecting that he was dealing with proceeds of crime committed on or about 9 June which involved $500,000 of the $1,500,000 that relates to Mr Chak’s first offence in time. Each of Mr Man’s offences are charged under the same provisions that relate to Mr Chak. Likewise I hasten to say Mr Yeung’s charges. Although one charge of the two that he has is an offence of aiding and abetting, counselling or procuring Mr Chak to deal with five hundred thousand reasonably suspected of being proceeds of crime.
	
	
	In any event Mr Man committed his four offences on 9 June 2016 as I pointed out the second offence in time was on or about 14 June 2016 in which he dealt with $500,000 in the manner charged. On 16 June 2016 he dealt with $500,000 and on 20 June 2016 he dealt with 500,000.
	
	
	The offences relating to Mr Yeung include an offence of aiding and abetting on 17 June 2016 Mr Chak to deal with $500,000 reasonably suspected of being the proceeds of crime and on 20 June 2016 dealing with $600,110 reasonably suspected of being the proceeds of crime.
	
	
	There are two other offenders who are connected to this matter who I have stood over to next Friday, Ms Engelina and Mr Hermawam who were arrested on or about 17 June 2016 in circumstances I need not detail at this particular point of time.
	
	
	Each of these offenders were arrested on 20 June as I said and have been in custody since that date. Their period of time in custody will be obviously taken into account and I have structured the sentences accordingly.
	
	
	In relation to Mr Chak it is said that he dealt with a total of $4,700,000. In relation to Mr Man he dealt with $2,000,000. In relation to Mr Yeung he dealt with $1,100,110. The sums involving Man and Yeung are sums that relate to the sums in the possession of Mr Chak or dealt with by Mr Chak at various times by and large. There is something of an anomaly in the sum of $600,110 that was dealt with by Mr Yeung on 20 June, which I will deal with when I come back to detail of the facts.
	
	
	In relation to each of the offenders I have accorded them a discount of 25% to represent the facilitation of the course of justice by their pleas of guilty.
	
	
	The facts of the matter are, if I could illustrate it by reference to Mr Chak, that only a very small amount of the $4,700,000 which he admits dealing with has been seized by police. The police operation leading to the charges was very much driven by telephone intercept material and surveillance. Although there were various statements made and references within those telephone intercepts which permit a reasonable contention to be drawn as to the sums of money Mr Chak was talking about and what was going to happen to those sums of money, his pleas of guilty have greatly aided the prosecution in this matter. The prosecution may have had difficulties establishing his guilt in relation to some or many of the charges brought against him without the plea of guilty. The same can be said by and large in relation to of Mr Man and Mr Yeung and as I understand it the three men pleaded at the Local Court I am prepared to accept they pleaded guilty at the first reasonable opportunity and thus they will be accorded that discount.
	
	
	In considering this matter I point out from the outset that I was invited to read a number of authorities for comparative sentencing purposes and for considering the principles to be applied in an offence of this type. The particular authority which was probably of the greatest assistance was the decision of Shi v R [2014] NSWCCA 276, particularly in the judgment for the Court of Justice Bellew which I will quote at an appropriate time.
	
	
	The facts of the matter as was discussed earlier were initially presented to me in an “Executive Statement” of facts and a “Detailed Statement of Facts” which left me somewhat confused as to precisely what was alleged against each of the accused. In fact to make sense of the Detailed Statement of Facts given that the “Executive Summary” was not a “full” executive summary. I had to in reality, consider the way in which the matter had been put to me by the learned Crown Prosecutor in his treatment of the evidence in his written submissions. I am now favoured with an Amended Statement of Facts or particularly, “Executive Summary” from I which I will now quote:
	


“Mr Yeung came to Australia on 10 May 2016. Mr Chak with Mr Man” (I have seen a photograph of the two of them going through the immigration control area of the Sydney Airport on that date) came together from Hong Kong on 26 May. Each of the three accused indicated that they were travelling to Australia for a holiday and they were provided with visitor visas for a three months duration. Their activities apparently came to the attention of an investigating authority attached to the AFP and the three men were the subject of close surveillance and telephone intercepts which led to their arrest on 20 June.”


	
	The other two accused as I mentioned were arrested on 17 June 2016 after Mr Chak had handed over to one of them at least $500,000. The woman Ms Engelina was actually in possession of a further $40,000 which gives rise to another allegation which will be later dealt with on a Form.
	
	
	To quote from the statement of facts:
	


“A notable feature of the offending was the use of “token” system to facilitate the exchange of money. By this system a note of currency is given by the party that collects the unlawfully obtained money for it to be laundered to the party that is handling handing that money over. The money is only exchanged once the serial number on the note has been sighted, once sighted the collector hands the token to the other party handing the money over. The token is retained by that party as a receipt to verify that the transaction had taken place and to prevent further disputes.”


	
	Various activities concerned with the various charges reflect the use of this token system.
	
	
	In relation to a common charge in one sense between Mr Chak and Mr Man, the first charge each of them is to be sentenced for, on the night of 8 June 2016 and in the morning of 9 June 2016 Mr Chak had a number of telephone conversations using a telephone service that was subscribed to Mr Yeung. I should point out in the other version of the detailed facts I was aware of the fact that Mr Yeung, after his arrival in Australia, apart from obtaining a local mobile phone service, purchased at least two cars paying modest sums of money for them. The offender had a conversation with a person or persons that are described throughout the statement of facts I have as ‘UM’ or ‘unidentified male’ and the two people spoke in code. Based on the evidence from the telephone intercepts reference in that conversation, where Mr Chak was told to pick up fifty at ten o’clock, was a reference to picking up $500,000. These code meanings were confirmed by later seizures of money, for example on 17 June when Mr Hermawam and Ms Engelina were arrested and also police activities on 20 June.
	
	
	On 9 June at about 8.55am Mr Chak contacted an unidentified male and confirmed a drop of “fifty sets of newspapers at ten o’clock”, which was a reference as I understand it to $500,000. On 9 June Mr Man went to a person who was a money remittance operator in Liverpool Street. That person apparently has been charged but still awaits trial. Man was carrying a white spotted shopping bag which contained $500,000. The Crown case is that Mr Chak either organised or permitted Man to have the money to deliver it. Mr Chak called an unidentified male and told him that Mr Man was looking for the money remitter and the transaction was confirmed. The money was apparently remitted by the money remitter to “unknown person or persons”. Connected to the first charge relating to Mr Chak is a further sum of $1,000,000 which is identified by reference to the codes that were used by Mr Chak.
	
	
	At about 2.07pm and again at 4.10pm Mr Chak called an unidentified male and made arrangements with him, speaking in a form of code, with advice to the accused as to a person that he was to meet. Mr Chak later rang back to advise that the money had been handed over. This money was not intercepted by police and what happened to it is unknown. The sum of money is said to be $1,000,000 as I said. During the same day 9 June 2016 discussions were had about the handing over of what is said to be $300,000 Australian, the following day and that gives rise to a later charge.
	
	
	The facts refer to an event on 14 June 2016 in which Mr Chak dealt with $800,000 and Mr Man dealt with $500,000. On 14 June at 8.49 Mr Chak contacted again an unidentified male and arranged for the handover of $500,000 in the usual code at the office of the money remitter at about “11pm” (I think that should be 11am, but be that as it may), and a hand over of a further “thirty”, being $300,000 at mid-day, or it could be midnight, at a location near Haymarket. The facts state that:
	


“At 11.01am on 14 June Mr Man went to the money remitter and delivered an amount of half a million dollars and Mr Chak had either organised or permitted Mr Man to have the money to deliver it. This money was never seized by police. Later that same day Mr Chak again contacted an unidentified man and said that it was all done, meaning that the earlier arranged exchange of money at “12pm” had been completed.”


	
	This is the occasion that it is said $300,000 was dealt with. This money was not seized by police and what happened to it is not known.
	
	
	At 12.03pm on 14 June 2016 in a call to an unidentified man by Mr Chak, Mr Chak indicated that he had “forty”, this was taken to be a reference to $400,000. The next day on 15 June 2016 at 10am Mr Chak using the service he had previously used confirmed with the unidentified man that a meeting would occur with a particular person and he would call the unidentified man when that was done. At 12.10pm on this day Mr Chak contacted an unidentified man and told him the handover was done and that Mr Chak confirmed that he had only “ten left”, being a reference to $100,000. The inference is to be drawn in the context of it being said that there was $300,000 handed over, that Mr Chak himself personally handed over the money.
	
	
	This is the sequence 3 offence relating to Mr Chak.
	
	
	The sequence 4 offence relating to Mr Chak and the third offence relating to Mr Man occurred on 16 June 2016 where the two offenders were concerned with dealing with the same $500,000.
	
	
	On 16 June in the morning Mr Chak rang the unidentified man and the unidentified man confirmed with Mr Chak that a drop of $500,000 was to take place at 11.30am. Mr Chak confirmed with this unknown person that he had “the receipt” ready and that he would go to the “office” just before 11am.
	
	
	The reference to fifty in this conversation was a reference to $500,000. Mr Man delivered this sum of money to the money remitter just before 11am and later that day in the early afternoon Mr Chak confirmed the delivery with the unidentified man, the money was not seized by police, it is believed the money was remitted to an unknown person or persons.
	
	
	The sequence 5 offence relating to Mr Chak of which he is solely charged concerns the offender dealing with $300,000, this was a matter where the offender Chak discussed with the unidentified man or an unidentified man the handing over of $300,000 and the offender the following day confirming the money had been handed over, this money was not seized.
	
	
	On 17 June 2016 the offender Chak dealt with $500,000 and Mr Yeung aided and abetted him. This was the $500,000 as I understand it that was found in the possession of Mr Hermawam and with which Ms Engelina has a connection. The man Chak spoke to an unidentified man and Chak confirmed with that person that $500,000 would be handed over by him at Mascot Station that day. Mr Chak arrived at that station being driven by Mr Yeung. His aiding and abetting is the assistance provided to Mr Chak to deliver the money to Mr Hermawam and Ms Engelina. This was an occasion where the token system was used which I earlier identified. He handed over the money in a box and Mr Hermawam placed this money in the boot of a Subaru which Ms Engelina was driving. This exchange was observed by police and shortly afterwards police arrested Mr Hermawam and Ms Engelina and found, not only the $500,000 that had been handed over by Mr Chak but a further $40,000 in a bag belonging to Ms Engelina.
	
	
	With regard to the matter sequence 6 in relation to Mr Chak this is an offence of dealing with $300,000 on 18 June, the same modus operandi was in place. Mr Chak contacted an unidentified man and confirmed the delivery by him, that is Mr Chak at 3pm of $300,000 apparently Mr Chak had been provided with a “token” for the purposes of the exchange, that is the serial number of a banknote.
	
	
	Under police surveillance Mr Chak was seen to be driven in a car by Mr Man, Mr Chak left the car at the intersection of Ashfield and later confirmed by telephone that he had exchanged the money. The money was never seized by police and what happened to it is subsequently unknown.
	
	
	On 20 June 2016 Mr Chak and Mr Man together further dealt with the sum of $500,000 in the context of Mr Chak organising for Mr Man to deliver to the money remitter the sum of $500,000 on 19 June 2016. Mr Chak confirmed these arrangements with the unidentified man as occurring the following day. Mr Yeung was observed by police in North Bexley receiving a bag from another person in a street. This bag was later seized by police and found to contain $600,110 thus the particulars in relation to the deal with a sum of money suspected of being proceeds of a crime.
	
	
	Mr Yeung was arrested at 10.45am, the offender Man was observed by police carrying a blue bag, going to the money remitter. He was arrested there. The bag contained a further $500,000. The Crown case alleges that Mr Chak organised or permitted Man to have the money which was carried to the money remitter.
	
	
	Mr Chak was arrested as well and the three men were interviewed. In relation to the interviews these three men gave, that is Mr Chak, Mr Man and Mr Yeung, for reasons which I will outline in a moment very little of what they said was true. For example Mr Chak stated that he was not involved in money laundering, that he had come from Hong Kong with Mr Man to travel, he said he was a carpenter by trade, he claimed he was travelling on the day of his arrest with Mr Man to get a discounted airfare to Thailand, he was not keeping watch for police or anything like that, just watching out for parking inspectors. He claimed that he did not notice that Mr Man was carrying the blue cooler bag that he had in his possession when arrested or had carried to the money remitter carrying $500,000. He claimed that he did not know Mr Yeung very well. He was a friend of a friend and he could not remember what he was doing on previous days and had nothing to do with handing Mr Hermawam anything. He also denied dropping off $300,000 on 18 June. This summary of his interview reflects a number of things that are clearly untrue by reference to his plea, the statement of facts and some other representations he has made out of Court to others.
	
	
	Mr Man was reluctant to provide information. He claimed he was here on holidays, he said he was sightseeing and running short of money and claimed that he was more or less recruited here in Australia. He claimed that he was paid $500 to move the bag he was carrying on 20 June 2016 because he needed some money. He claimed that he had only done one other delivery, claimed that he had never been to the money remitter before 20 June 2016 and so it goes on. All these representations in his interview are untrue. He understated the number of times that he had visited the money remitter, he claimed that he did not think there was anything illegal in the bag.
	
	
	Mr Yeung also claimed to be here in Australia and was in Sydney “having fun”. He claimed that he had self-funded his trip to Australia. That he only intended to stay here for a month. He claimed that he bought a car for $6,000 at a second-hand car dealership. He said largely in Sydney he was just having a good time, going to the beach and other things. He claimed no memory of events on 17 June 2016 and claimed that he did not know Mr Man.
	
	
	In relation to the two offenders Mr Chak and Mr Man they have no prior criminal convictions as far as I am aware, Mr Yeung had two convictions, one I was advised of at the sentence proceedings on the last occasion, the other I was advised of earlier this afternoon.
	
	
	Mr Yeung was convicted in 2006 of importing a thing into Australia with the intention of dishonestly obtaining or dealing in personal financial information contrary to section 480.6 of the Criminal Code, of the Commonwealth. He was sentenced in the Local Court to a term of 12 months imprisonment to be released after serving six months upon entering into a recognisance to be of good behaviour for six months on his release. I am now informed today that he has a further conviction in the District Court of New South Wales. This is recorded as occurring on 27 March 2009. He appeared before Judge Berman SC and he was convicted of “possess property reasonably suspected of being proceeds of crime”. He was convicted. He was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment pursuant to section 20 (1)(b) Crimes Act (Cth) 1914. He was ordered to be released after serving 12 months on entering a recognisance to be of good behaviour for a period of six months. I will need to further digest that conviction to be able to pronounce a sentence for him.
	
	
	Each of the offenders did not give evidence before me. Each of the offenders produced a bundle of material that was not objected to by the Crown. Learned Senior Counsel appearing for Mr Chak at one point of his oral submissions made the claim that the material within the defence bundle was “unchallenged”. Well with respect to that proposition, even though the Crown did not object to the material, it does not necessarily mean that the material is “unchallenged”. In any event it is a matter where the court is required to make factual determinations in due course, taking into account the attitude of the parties. If something is asserted that is not the subject the test of cross-examination it can be seen as hearsay evidence, unable to be verified by independent sources, then one is required to approach the evidence with care. The offender has written a letter to the Court expressing an apology and stating that he has a wife and daughter, that he is a carpenter by trade but that he had to pay for an operation on his mother’s eyes to remove cataracts in 2015 and another operation in 2016. He asserts:
	


“A person who knew of my financial troubles told me there was an opportunity to do some work that might help solve part of my financial problems and this would involve me going to Australia to do some work for no more than three months. I was not told precisely what I had to do. I saw it as a chance which would help to repay my medical expenses debt as soon as possible.”


	
	He went on to say:
	


“After arrival in Australia I realised that I needed to listen to instructions given to me over the phone and then to collect sums of cash and deliver them to remittance companies or persons as directed, although no one ever told me about it, I now suspect the money might be evading tax.”


	
	There is very little of that that could be accepted so far as the claim that he was unaware prior to coming to Australia of the reason for his presence in Australia. I do not accept it and I will explain why later on. It stands at odds with respect with the reality of the situation that on his own account he came to Australia in financial difficulty. Not, as he claimed in his interviews to police, that he was here as a tourist. He says in his statement to me that he did not tell the police the truth when he was arrested and he reflected upon the difficulties of being in custody and the difficulties of being separated from his wife and daughter and the hardships that they undergo whilst he is in custody here. He also speaks about the suffering of his mother.
	
	
	I have some documents from a hospital in Hong Kong which confirms in part the treatment provided to his mother. But I note in relation to the detail of that that his mother’s admission to hospital occurs after he was arrested here in Australia. I have a document from his wife asking for leniency for her husband and she speaks of his diligence at work, the way in which he was community minded, providing support for the “Save the Children Fund” and also donating to “Doctors without Frontiers” I take that to be the French organisation, ‘Medicine Sans Frontieres’. She speaks of the strain upon her whilst he is away and makes comments about the circumstances of his offending which I cannot really place much weight upon. With regard to the circumstances of his mother she confirms the financial difficulties relating to her treatment and she speaks about the fact that he has expressed remorse to her.
	
	
	I have a reference from the gaol indicating that he is a positive person in custody and he has been employed at the gaol for some period of time since July 2016 I was provided with some very limited statistics which are not of a great deal of assistance because of their limited information about the character of the matters that are dealt with the very small number of cases that are reflected in the statistics and the like.
	
	
	I have a report from David Green psychologist, that report tells me that the offender has no mental illness or mental disability which is causally connected to his offending. So far as his circumstances in custody the offender is reported having difficulty coping with his incarceration. It is said that he “described symptoms of clinical depression”, stating that he felt “very unhappy” which one could understand, but there is nothing in the report which reflects any mental condition relevant to the sentencing exercise.
	
	
	The psychologist’s report is more of a pre-sentence report and much of it is dependant of course upon the truthfulness of the offender. He notes that the offender made “unprompted statements of regret” when being interviewed. He notes the offender who is now, as I understand it 47 years of age, is a native of Hong Kong with a close relationship with his mother. He notes that his work as a carpenter has been on the basis of the information provided to him by the offender affected by economic forces beyond his control and the fact as he explained it in the history that he borrowed money to pay for his mother’s surgery, he was unable to fully repay the loan and accepted a job offer in Sydney. It is quite clear with respect to that claim that I could not conclude that it was a job offer for him to come here to do carpentry work. There is no evidence that he was in any way concerned with such matters from the time of his arrival in Australia and his prompt, that is within a week of his arrival in Australia, involvement in this money laundering scheme speaks very loudly of the circumstances of the reason for his coming to Australia.
	
	
	In relation to his background, relying upon the history given to the psychologist, I note that the offender is a member of a large family, seven children. Why the offender has been left with the financial obligation of paying for his mother’s operation to the exclusion of other members of his family, I do not know. He has had an uneventful life in Hong Kong on his account, leaving school at 15 and undertaking an apprenticeship in carpentry before becoming a master carpenter.
	
	
	There is nothing in the history of the offender that gives any indication as to the circumstance in which he would be involved, obviously with an organisation that is concerned with money laundering in Australia. I am prepared to accept at face value that he is a skilled tradesman and he has done work in that regard. But I do not believe in the history that he has provided to the psychologist, or in his letter to the Court, that the full story of his involvement in this affair has been revealed to the Court.
	
	
	With regard to Mr Man, he likewise has written a letter of apology. He is a younger man, he is now aged 27 years. He has no siblings, he does not have a wife or children and he is a lorry driver in Hong Kong. He says that his mother is unaware that he is in custody in Australia. He has not told her because he did not want her to worry. He has been in contact with his “girlfriend” whilst in custody. He intends to marry when he is released from custody and return obviously to Hong Kong. He, as with the offender Chak, states that at the beginning of 2016 he was in financial difficulty. He needed money to pay for medical bills and he could not find anyone to borrow the money but he ended up borrowing the money from a financial institution and was unable to meet payments even though he was working very hard and that he was advised by the company to come to work in Australia, “so I could meet the repayments and pay the loan back”. He claims that he was “threatened that something bad might happen if I didn’t take this advice”. There is a scintilla of a suggestion of non-exculpatory duress in this letter but in the context of it being unsworn, in the context of no other evidence from the offender in relation to the matter and in the way in which the case was conducted, bearing in mind there was no serious submission made that I could take non-exculpatory duress into account, it is not a relevant issue.
	
	
	Having regard to Justice Johnston’s remarks in the decision of Tiknius it would appear to me that the offender has not established on balance that non-exculpatory duress has any role to play in this particular matter. It seems as though on the facts available to me, in fact it is clearly established from those facts, that the offender was a willing associate of Mr Chak and willingly was able to do his bidding when requested. He speaks in his reference or letter to the Court of the reflection he has had whilst in custody and the effect upon him of being in custody. He had no skills in English when he arrived in Australia. But he now can undertake basic conversations. He has produced some material. One reference confirms employment as a delivery worker for a year between April 2015 and May 2016. He likewise has been industrious within the Corrective Services environment. I have a letter from his girlfriend confirming their relationship and the fact that his mother who suffers some ill health misses him and that he is sorry for his involvement in this offence.
	
	
	I have in his case the most detailed psychology report of all the reports that have been tendered. With regard to that psychology report I have taken into account the history. He told the psychologist that the debt that he had in relation to surgery that was required in a private hospital was thirty thousand dollars Hong Kong. My memory is that it is approximately five or so Hong Kong dollars to the Australia dollar. He gave a history of borrowing money but they could not, that is he and his partner, pay back the money that was borrowed and thus he borrowed the money from a “loan shark syndicate”. The money they borrowed was for the girlfriend to have surgery but they were unable to make repayments. He was approached by “the criminal syndicate” and given two options, either to make the repayments or do a job in Sydney for a month which involved delivering bags between places. He again reasserts the claim “for each delivery he would be offered $500”. Given his debt and his interest payment as he claims in this history it sounds very unlikely to me that he would only be paid $500 Australia for each delivery. He was involved in four such deliveries. That would barely meet the interest that was being demanded of him from the money that was borrowed. It may have been of course if he did fall into the hands of loan sharks he was told that his entire debt would be forgiven. In which case the benefit for coming to Australia for working as he did would be far greater than $500 per delivery.
	
	
	It is to be borne in mind in relation to this matter of course as it is to be borne in mind in relation to Mr Chak and Mr Yeung that in the various ways in which they claim financial difficulty, they were able to fly to Australia and they were able to sustain themselves in Australia with accommodation, with cars, access to mobile phones and presumably living expenses during this period of time.
	
	
	The suggestion that one or two of them makes that they were required to finance themselves in Australia defies any common sense and certainly is quite at odds with the severe financial difficulties that they complain about as causing them to be recruited the way they were. In fact Mr Man is the man who claims that he had to organise his own accommodation and car hire. I cannot see how he could afford to pay for accommodation and car hire and living expenses, given what he claimed to be his financial circumstances.
	
	
	He has an interesting background of Chinese and Pilipino origin, although he was born in Hong Kong and he is a Hong Kong national. He says that in Hong Kong he has not been involved in any criminal activities. His father died in 2008, his father and mother had no criminal history. I have had regard to the detail of the psychological assessment, there is no evidence of any history of psychiatric disability or disorder or psychological disability or disorder. He has never been to see mental health professionals in the past and the various tests that were undertaken by the psychologist which appear to be extensive failed to reveal any particular condition which is abnormal or severe or chronic. With regard to the testing of him, it was thought that he was not malingering. He has some high degree of ‘self-deception enhancement’ as it is described, which might mean promoting his own cause beyond reality.
	
	
	So far as what I would regard as significant or relevant matters, symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress were within normal range. There is no evidence of any post-traumatic stress disorder. There is no evidence of alcohol problems, drug problems or the like. He is considered at low risk of reoffending. There is little evidence it is said of ‘criminal tendencies’ of ‘antisocial personality’ problems or ‘conduct disorders’.
	
	
	The conclusion of the psychologist was that the offender had experienced a mild level of depression since his arrest, his incarceration potentially impacts on his mother’s health, he claims pressures upon him both in respect of his girlfriend’s financial difficulties or his financial difficulties arising from her medical problems and his “fear of harm” which caused him to engage in the current offence. The risk of recidivism is said to be ‘low’.
	
	
	Turning to Mr Yeung if I may, bearing in mind I am dealing with all three offenders at the present time, he writes a letter of apology, he states simply that he was hard up for money in Hong Kong and that he was asked by a friend if “I want to earn some money in Australia”. He claims:
	


“I asked him the work type and he said it’s easy only collecting and delivering money. I didn’t know it may cause this serious problem. Now I feel regretful for my behaviour.”


	
	He misses his daughter and his mother and he hopes to be reunited with them soon. I have a reference from his brother that reflects upon the fact that their mother is disabled. She has had a stroke and suffers hypotension and serious diabetes and their mother is greatly affected by him being in custody. He said that the offender had a business that failed after the birth of his daughter and then struggled with financial problems. He was “a problem gambler”. His failed business and gambling caused the offender’s wife to want a divorce and they had not lived together for many years. His daughter who is apparently 14 years of age misses her father.
	
	
	This offender was born in 1967 thus on my calculation he is now 50 years of age. I have a psychologist’s report for him which is not particularly long from Dr Zhang. She reflected scores on some psychological testing of mild symptoms of depression, moderate symptoms of anxiety and mild symptoms of stress. The report contains some of the history I have already outlined noting that he has worked as a truck-driver. He has never been previously treated for any mental illness or mental disability there is no evidence of any disability or mental illness causally connected to the offending or impacting upon his judgment. The same with the other offenders. He reported that his detention did not have a significant impact on his mental health. Now that I know he has been in gaol twice before in Australia, he would be quite familiar with the system here, unlike his co-accused.
	
	
	However his detention has had a significant on his family. I pause for a moment to reflect upon the fact that having previously been gaoled in Australia in 2006, 2009, his family thus would not be ignorant of the consequences of him being detained here in Australia. He is said to meet the “criteria” for a clinical diagnosis of ‘gambling disorder’, he has a “strong and persistent preoccupation with gambling” which is “to the detriment to his function in social, financial and legal domains” and he relies on others to provide money to pay debts incurred by gambling. He requires some ongoing psychological treatment to treat this gambling disorder, if it exists and I am prepared to accept that it is a matter that has impacted upon him over time, he obviously needs professional assistance.
	
	
	In relation to this matter of his gambling and his explanation for involvement it somewhat seems strange, given the fact that one might have thought that the same people recruited all three accused, that one person claims that he fell into the hands of loan sharks who threatened him in some way to come to Australia to commit the crime and Mr Yeung claims that he was introduced to this scheme by some friend without any threats of harm to collect and deliver money. The accounts of the respective offenders just do not in any way appear consistent and as I said these accounts are entirely inconsistent with the version they gave to the police on the first opportunity they had to explain themselves.
	
	
	In relation to this matter, as is always the case with the Crown representing the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, I have very extensive written submissions which are most helpful. There are particular matters I will refer to that I obviously will need to take into account, for example I am required to sentence each of the offenders in accordance with Part 1B of the Commonwealth Crimes Act and that requires on the part of the Court the Court to have regard to the terms of section 16A(1) that is imposing a sentence for each offence that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence. I am required in addition to take into account a range of other matters set out in s.16A(2) including the nature and circumstances of the offence, (just picking out relevant matters I hasten to say, not every matter under the sub-section), if the offence forms part of a course of conduct consisting of a series of criminal acts of same or similar character, the degree to which relevant offender has shown contrition for the offence, the fact that each of the offenders has pleaded guilty, the degree to which the person has cooperated with law enforcement agencies, the deterrent effect of any sentence may have on the offender and the deterrent affect that any sentence may have on other people, the need to ensure the offender is adequately punished, the character, antecedents, age, means and physical and mental conditions of the respective offenders, the prospects of rehabilitation, the probably effect that any sentence or order under consideration would have on any of the family or dependents, amongst perhaps other matters.
	
	
	In relation to that last matter, although each of the offenders has family who are ill or have health problems, there has not been demonstrated anything of the character of exceptional circumstances or high levels of dependency which would warrant considering the interests of third parties as a mitigating factor in this sentencing exercise.
	
	
	To return to one of the most important matters upon which the Crown’s submissions have dwelt, the nature and circumstances of the offending, I have set out the facts in relation to the matter. My conclusions in relation to the role of the various parties are as follows:
	
	
	Firstly, in relation to Mr Chak, it is clear that in respect to the offences with which I am concerned, he was directing operations in Australia or in Sydney under the direction and in consultation with an unknown person either in Australia or overseas. He was liaising with this unknown person to put into effect both the receipt and then the distribution of sums of money. He directed on occasions other people, such as Mr Man and Mr Yeung, or alternatively liaised with them. He was obviously entrusted at all levels to receive and distribute the money and give direction as to what was to be done with it. I accept the money, the subject of these charges was not his, nor was it Mr Man’s or Mr Yeung’s. They were effectively “employees” with different roles to play and it must be said that Mr Chak’s role was more significant than that of Mr Man and Mr Yeung.
	
	
	Mr Chak was subject to direction but he was also involved in consultation. There was obviously a system in place, but he well knew the system and he well knew how the money was to be “laundered”. This does not mean of course that he necessarily knew the source of the money, but he knew what the sums were and he knew the scale of the operation in which he himself was involved. As I pointed out before he handled or directed the handling of $4,700,000. He obviously in the context of the common charges of the men worked closely with Mr Yeung and Mr Man. He must have known before coming to Australia about what he was required to do to have the express and implicit trust that was reposed in him to do the tasks involving substantial sums of money, or else have the assurance that Mr Man and Mr Yeung themselves were trustworthy.
	
	
	As far as Mr Man and Mr Yeung were concerned they were delivery men but they were entrusted delivery men. They knew what they were delivering contrary to their false statements to police. They had provided to them by Mr Chak the trust to be able to act on his direction without supervision. They were also consulting with Mr Chak, although largely they took direction from him. Each of the offenders sought to portray themselves, as I said earlier, as being here in Australia for some other purpose, tourism and the like and being caught up in this affair without much knowledge of what was to happen. I do not accept that that can be possibly true and I accept beyond reasonable doubt that they had come here for the purpose for which they were arrested.
	
	
	I note that amongst other things, apart from what I have already found, Mr Chak and Mr Man came here together on 26 May and had common involvement with a course of criminal conduct within a fortnight of their arrival. Although Mr Yeung came earlier he bought on the Crown case at least two cars within a week although bought them relatively cheaply. A number of phone calls made by Mr Chak were made on a mobile service that had been subscribed to Mr Yeung. That is a local mobile service showing the fact that Mr Yeung was making some arrangements to assist Mr Chak in his endeavours.
	
	
	The short period of time in which all the men became involved in substantial cash transactions, perhaps Mr Yeung a little later and certainly after Man and Chak shows, given the trust placed in them, the familiarity they must have had with the people that were directing these operations. As I have earlier pointed out each man produced material in their subjective case, referring to financial difficulties arising from the circumstances I have outlined. Their versions of recruitment are apparently inconsistent with one another. I have already dealt with the issue of non-exculpatory duress.
	
	
	Their living circumstances and their debts and financial obligations in Hong Kong as claimed in the various reports that I have quoted, and in their apologies to the Court in some respect, very much puts to lie the claims they made in their electronic interviews of simply being tourists that were in some way caught up in something about which they knew nothing.
	
	
	The facts of the matter are as I have pointed out, on their own account, they could not afford to come here as tourists, or stay here paying for their own expenses for the period of time that that occurred. It is entirely inconsistent with their family and financial circumstances that they should come here for any sort of holiday. The enterprise itself obviously required a degree of planning Mr Man points to himself organised crime syndicate, recruiting him and it is clear that each man to differing degrees perhaps obviously had to be intimately familiar with the way in which the relevant syndicate operated in order to participate. As I pointed out, they needed money to survive in Australia which on their account they did not have. It had to be provided to them by others.
	
	
	I have already made the finding that I do not accept their versions of what they claim that they were “paid”. On the other hand I cannot speculate as to what financial benefit they would receive, except that they were to receive some financial benefit.
	
	
	In the context of dealing with the nature and circumstances of the offending the Crown went to great lengths in his very helpful submissions to persuade me that I should reach a conclusion that in the context of the decision in Shi and the decision of Jiao [2015] NSWCCA 95, that in the circumstances of the particular offending I should make some conclusion that would not offend ‘De Simoni’ principles that each of the accused had a subjective state of mind concerning the source of the money that was available. Reference is made to a West Australian decision which I need not cite, that a person can engage in conduct prescribed by the relevant section with which these men are charged “while subjectively holding the relevant suspicion” which would include some knowledge that the money was of a particular character as proceeds of crime. In that regard I note, as I mentioned earlier, the observations of Justice Bellew. He pointed out by reference to the structure of Division 400 of the Code that an offence brought under section 400.9(1) falls at the lowest of the scale. The offence does not require proof of any subjective criminality at all. One of the errors made by the sentencing Judge in Shi was to ascribe to the offender a state of mind that would have required the offender to be charged with a more serious offence and was in contradiction of what accorded with De Simoni ((1981) 147 CLR 383) principles that are set out at 389 of that judgment.
	
	
	In relation to this aspect of the matter Justice Bellew noted in the sentencing of Mr Shi that the Judge in effect found that the applicant had exhibited subjective criminality which was not an element of the offence with which she was charged. When read as a whole the learned sentencing Judge at first instance had regard to the applicant’s knowledge as a factor which aggravated her offending which ought to have been reflected in a more serious charge being brought. If the applicant in fact knew or believed that the money was the proceeds of crime then she would have been liable for prosecution for an offence contrary to perhaps section 400.3 of the Code a substantially more serious offence. His Honour went on to say that consistent with De Simoni principle it was the case that it was fundamental and important that no person should be punished for an offence for which he or she has not been convicted.    Thus, in this matter I am not prepared to make the finding that the Crown has invited me to make about some subjective belief of the offender beyond that which is pleaded. In any event on the facts of this matter although obviously one would be highly suspicious of Mr Chak, Mr Man and Mr Yeung for various reasons, particularly Mr Chak’s close connection with those that were directing him, I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the matters sought to be litigated by the Crown in its arguments in the written submissions.
	
	
	With regard to the Crown’s written submissions if I could just briefly touch upon some matters that I have not already touched upon I believe I have effectively summarised precisely what the offenders did. The Crown submits that the offenders were to varying degrees of course, Mr Chak more so than Mr Yeung and Mr Man, involved in a course of conduct and that the plea of guilty is a fact to be taken into account. I have already dealt with the issue of discount. I have had regard to the expressions of regret of the offenders I am prepared to accept them on face value, although the issue of contrition is not a matter of great substance in this particular sentencing exercise. So far as their cooperation with law enforcement agencies are concerned their cooperation in terms of what they said in the course of their interviews was not great. No particular benefit flowed to law enforcement from the circumstances of their interviews.
	
	
	Obviously there is a need for adequate punishment, personal deterrence, particularly more so in the case of Mr Yeung, given his criminal history and weight to be given to general deterrence although these matters are to be seen in the context of the available maximum penalty, having regard of course to the scheme of Division 400 of the Act, which the Crown kindly provided to me on the last occasion. Examination of the various offences that arise reflects the degrees of criminality that are reflected within the Division. For an offence under 400.3 the maximum penalty is 25 years imprisonment or 1,500 penalty units. As was pointed out the offences with which these offenders are charged with the exception of an offence under section 400.0(1A) are the least serious offences which can be charged in a range of offences.
	
	
	With regard to the issue of duress and motivation for committing the offences I have already dealt with those matters in the course of dealing with the evidence. It should be fairly said that each of the offenders quite clearly were involved in these offences for financial reward. This was a matter I must say that Mr Ramage QC dealt with at some length in his written submissions. His submission seems to be directed towards the provisions of section 21A Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which has no relevance in this sentencing exercise being concerned with alleged breaches of State law. He is to be sentenced within, if I could call it, the confines of a sentencing exercise concerned with a maximum penalty of three years imprisonment for each of the offences to which the prisoner has pleaded guilty. It is to be borne in mind that as Mr Ramage has submitted, in his submissions to me on the issue of financial reward, one would expect came automatically or naturally with involvement in offending of this type. One would not have thought that anybody would be going around town taking half a million dollars to money remitters that he did not own or did not genuinely have a legal claim to without receiving some financial reward.
	
	
	In respect of the submissions that were made by Mr Ramage QC for Mr Chak I have dealt with the issue of his role. It was submitted that Mr Chak’s role was “no higher than Man and Yeung”. I cannot accept that. It is quite clear on the facts that Mr Chak not only committed more offences but had a leading role in directing or consulting with Man and Yeung and the various references in the detailed statement of facts to the various conversations he had with an unnamed man or unnamed men, reflects upon the significance of his role. Again I do not believe that the money was his and certainly he was acting on instruction or with details being provided to him by others but he had a very trusted and significant position in the transactions with which I am concerned.
	
	
	I take into account his limited English and the impact upon him of being in custody. A foreign national with no English language skills and no support in this country will find his sentence harsher than other prisoners and various authorities are referred to including, the decision of De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194 and the decision of Nguyen [2009] NSWCCA 181. Also I note the effect upon his family of his presence here in Australia. Of course this is a necessary incident of his arrest and charging that he should be separated from his family.    
	
	
	There is no doubt that he, Mr Man and Mr Yeung were serving some form of organised crime “syndicate” but the character of the “syndicate” is not known to this Court nor the source of the money I cannot make any conclusion adverse to the three offenders that might be seen as a circumstance of “aggravation” touching upon or connected to the source of the money which was dealt with by each of the offenders.
	
	
	In any event the scale of the sums of money reflects the degree of organisation that was involved.
	
	
	Each of Mr Chak and Mr Man I am prepared to find have good prospects of rehabilitation. Again I am denied real evidence as to the character of their associations in Hong Kong. Mr Man has relative youth on his side. Each of these men have no prior convictions. For a man of Mr Chak’s age that is a very substantial issue and I accept that Mr Chak has qualifications that may provide him with opportunities of employment, given his qualification as a master carpenter.
	
	
	I have taken into account the statistics that have been provided, they provide limited assistance, Mr Ramage also supplied a summary from a Commonwealth Sentencing Data Base of sentences imposed upon pleas of not guilty for offences of this type, including multiple account but there are no details in that information to assist me as to the circumstances of the offenders, the sums of money and the like. In relation to that aspect of the matter I come back to the judgment of Shi. This case of course involved a woman from Shanghai dealing with, on my calculations something in the order of 35.9 million dollars. She appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal and had her sentence reduced from over five years to something in the order of four years, nine months with an adjustment of a non-parole period on the basis that the learned sentencing Judge had failed to give her credit for her cooperation which does not apply here. So she had an extra 5% discount accorded to her and she also had the benefit of a finding that the sentencing Judge had made an error in his assessment of her criminality by taking into account a matter that was not pleaded or for which she had not been convicted. But the individual sentences imposed in respect of particular offences under this same section, although on a number of occasions involving much greater sums, of money have been of assistance.
	
	
	The learned Crown also provided a schedule of cases relevant to each of the offenders which included Shi, another decision of Assafari from 2007 a decision of Almada 2015, a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal and a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal of Jiao to which I earlier referred upon which the Crown relied also for the purposes of the fact finding of the Court. I was provided with some other judgments for, what can be called, comparative purposes. Hua a decision of Berman J SC from 2013 which runs to a page and a half and a decision of Arsiotis [2015] NSWCCA 275. In relation to that particular judgment that offender was dealt with on a single count under the section which was in the sum of $990,000 for which the offender was to receive a benefit of $74,253. What happened however was that the sentencing Judge indicated that he was going to give the offender a discount of 25% upon a sentence of two years but ultimately only sentenced him to 20 months imprisonment which reflected a substantial mathematical error on his part. The error was accepted by the Crown and the offender was resentenced to a term of 18 months imprisonment. No comment was made other than in re-sentencing him under the same provision for that sum of money to a sentence of 18 months imprisonment as an appropriate sentence.
	
	
	I have had regard to the various provisions I am required to otherwise consider under Commonwealth sentencing, under section 17A of course I can only impose a term of imprisonment in respect of a Federal offender after I have considered all other available sentences and I am satisfied no other sentence is appropriate. For sentences greater than three years in aggregate I can fix a single non-parole period, pursuant to section 19AB(1) Crimes Act (Cth) which I propose to do in the case of Mr Chak. In the case of Mr Man I propose to impose sentences which will permit him to be released on a recognisance, given the total sentence I impose upon him will be less than three years.
	
	
	The Crown refers to the issue of totality of criminality and accumulation in the context of the terms of section 19(3) of the Commonwealth Crimes Act with regard to the issue of totality of criminality as it affects each of the offenders, I am mindful of the judgment of the High Court in Pearce (1994) 198 CLR 610, particularly at [45] in the judgment of the majority where it was held that in sentencing an offender for multiple offences I am required to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then turn my mind to the issue of concurrency, accumulation reflecting the totality of criminality. In considering the issue of totality of criminality of course I have regard to judgments such as the 1988 judgment of the High Court of Mill. With regard to the issue of appropriate accumulation in currency I note the principles summarised in the decision of Leacock v R [2017] NSWCCA 47, and also the subject of discussion in many other judgments including the 2000 judgment of Hammoud where Simpson J discussed the various principles to be considered. In relation to each of the offenders to reflect the totality of the criminality I propose some partial accumulation, the extent of that accumulation will reflect in part the totality of the criminality of the offenders.
	
	
	One other guiding principle to be borne in mind is the need to ensure appropriate “parity” in the sentencing of the offenders, each of these offenders in their various ways have common offences. Mr Man has four offences common to or related to offences committed by Mr Chak. Mr Yeung has two such offences and of course parity of sentencing requires consideration of Aristotelian, principles of equality, I am required to treat a like and a like to the extent of their alikeness and the unalike to the extent of their unlikeness on rational and reasonable grounds to paraphrase the words of Rothman J in the decision of Jimmy from 2010.
	
	
	I have taken into account all that has been put on behalf of Mr Chak by Mr Ramage and likewise in relation to Mr Lloyd representing Mr Yeung and Mr Man. His particular submissions, which were oral submissions, reflected upon the facts of the matter and the lesser criminality of Mr Man and Mr Yeung. His essential submission was that in respect of each of those men, all things taken into account, both objective and subjective I should impose sentences that would permit both men to be released on his words “immediately”. He pointed to the fact that there was no evidence that either of his clients having any independent signs of wealth or trappings of wealth, or living a lifestyle in Australia that reflected a greater involvement in the sums of cash that were dealt with, than performing tasks at the direction of others, he fairly said that would appear to be the case. But as I said their roles were more significant than simply being delivery men as Mr Man and Mr Yeung had portrayed themselves to be.
	
	
	Thus I propose to sentence Mr Chak and Mr Man, but I propose to stand over Mr Yeung until Friday week.
	
	
	I should point out in relation to Mr Chak’s matters I have structured the sentences to reflect the chronology of the offending. Obviously when an offender commits a series of offences such “prior good character” as he has might be seen to be diminished incrementally as each offence, although relevantly undetected at the time, was committed. But I ultimately have concluded that Sequence 1, although it is the first offence in time involving the most substantial sum of money should reflect the most significant sentence to be imposed. I hasten to say of course the sums of money are a properly considered relevant consideration in determining an appropriate sentence in the context of the maximum penalty, as the judgment in Shi, to which I referred, reflects.
	
	
	Mr Chak in relation to Sequence 2 you are convicted, you are sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to commence on 20 June 2016 expiring on 19 September 2017. In relation to sequence 3 you are convicted, you are sentenced to nine months imprisonment to commence on 20 June 2016 expiring on 19 March 2017. In relation to Sequence 4 you are convicted you are sentenced to 12 months imprisonment to commence on 20 June 2016 and expiring on 19 June 2017. In relation to Sequence 5 you are convicted you are sentenced to 18 months imprisonment to commence on 20 June 2016 and to expire on 19 December 2017. In relation to Sequence 6 you are convicted you are sentence to nine months imprisonment to commence on 20 March 2017 to expire on 19 December 2017. In relation to Sequence 7 you are convicted you are sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to commence on 20 June 2017 to expire on 19 September 2018. In relation to Sequence 1 you are convicted, you are sentenced to two years imprisonment to commence on 20 September 2017 expiring on 19 September 2019.
	
	
	In respect of those sentences, which is an aggregate sentence of three years three months imprisonment. I fix a non-parole period of one year nine months to commence on 20 June 2016 to expire on 19 March 2018. You will be eligible for release to parole on 19 March 2018. You can take a seat thank you.
	
	
	In relation to Mr Man if you could stand up please sir. In relation to Sequence 1 you are convicted, you are sentenced to 12 months imprisonment to date from 20 June 2016, that sentence will expire on 19 June 2017. In relation to Sequence 2 you are convicted, you are sentenced to 12 months imprisonment to date from 20 June 2016 expiring on 19 June 2017. In relation to Sequence 3 you are convicted, you are sentenced to nine months imprisonment to date from 20 December 2016 expiring on 19 September 2017. In respect of Sequence 5 you are convicted I sentence you to 12 months imprisonment without hard labour to commence on 20 June 2017 and to expire on 19 June 2018. I direct that you be released at the expiration of four months imprisonment expiring on 18 October 2017 on you entering a recognisance pursuant to section 19AC(2) Crimes Act 1914 yourself in the sum of $200 to be of good behaviour for a period of one year and six months from that date and to appear for sentence if called upon to do so at any time in respect of any breach within the said period. The total sentence imposed upon you on my calculation is two years imprisonment with a minimum term of 16 months.
	
	
	Just take a seat thank you. You will be eligible for release on 19 October 2017. That will be in about three weeks’ time, you may sit down thank you.
	
	
	Right Mr Crown any technical matters?
	
	
	JORDAN: Not so far as we are aware.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I’ll check the orders if there is any slip of the tongue or something I had them handwritten, my associate typed them up I noticed I made a couple of errors which I corrected on the run, hopefully my associate has fixed those up.
	
	
	JORDAN: Would your Honour and your Honour’s associate indulge us by emailing those.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: We’ll have the orders emailed to you, can we do it tomorrow, my associate, I’ll sign these orders now but my mother is 90 years of age and getting off a train from Newcastle at Central about ten past six and I have got to go and pick her up because nobody is there to pick her up.
	
	
	JORDAN: And I have got an army cadet to pick up at seven.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Right, we’ve all got to get away. If we can get your email address and the solicitor for Mr Chak’s email address and the solicitor for Mr Man’s email address, we will email the orders accordingly.
	
	
	JORDAN: Thank you your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Now Mr Interpreter could you tell Mr Chak that the total sentence I have imposed is three years three months and he will be eligible for release to parole in March next year. Could you tell Mr Man, subject to his rights of appeal and the Crown’s rights of appeal that he will be released on a recognisance to be of good behaviour on 19 October 2017. Could you tell Mr Chak and Mr Man that they are required in the period of time that they are subject to sentence out of custody to be of good behaviour, that the authorities have power to revoke the recognisance in the case of Mr Man in the parole and in the case of Mr Chak. I have not ordered any supervision because it would be impossible to enforce that supervision in Hong Kong and of course each man when released will go into immigration detention and presumably I would expect without knowing the details of this be deported back to Hong Kong. They may find it very difficult to come back to Australia if they so wished.
	
	
	Is there anything else I need to tell both offenders in relation to the terms of the orders I have made. I note that Bellew J went to great lengths to comply with the section when he pronounced on the judgment to explain the effect of the sentence in terms of the non-parole period and the like but I don’t think there is anything else I can say is there Mr Crown?
	
	
	JORDAN: It is our opinion your Honour has complied with the provision in the Crimes Act.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Thank you anything else I should say thank you. Mr Yeung, you are excused Mr Chak and Mr Man I wish you well for your future, Mr Yeung you will have to come back here next Friday. I order that Mr Yeung is here at this court on Friday 29 September 2017 at 10am and I direct a section 77 order for him to be here on that day, he is remanded bail refused.
	
	
	I should say in relation to Mr Yeung with this additional information if there is some further submission to be made to me about the matter once I have got Berman J’s judgment I should be advised next Friday I suppose.
	
	
	LLOYD: I’ll liaise with the Crown your Honour about the content of that judgment. I don’t have anything--
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Well I don’t know anything about it so and I’ve asked for it so we’ll see what we get next Monday. Mr Interpreter thank you so much, you have had a very difficult day, I appreciate that it is very hard your job and I probably didn’t help you very much by speaking too quickly for that I apologise, thank you to the court officer for staying back. We’ll adjourn.

		13 November 2017",2017-09-20 00:00:00,NSW District Court
6454053,"R v AULD, Darryl [2017] NSWDC 316","SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Darryl Auld appears today for sentence in relation to a matter for which he was committed for sentence from the Broken Hill Local Court on 28 February 2017. The offence is an offence of aggravated breaking entering and committing serious indictable offence. The aggravation I will explain in a moment, the serious indictable offence is intimidation. This is an offence contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, it carries a maximum penalty of 20 years and has a standard non-parole period of five years imprisonment. There are no offences on a Form 1, there are no related charges to be dealt with, the prisoner did not commit the offence whilst subject to conditional liberty.
	
	
	The offence in question was an offence committed on 16 October 2016. Having pleaded guilty in late February, the last day of February in fact in 2017, I accept that the prisoner entered his plea of guilty at the first reasonable opportunity and shall receive a discount of 25% upon the otherwise appropriate sentence for this offending. In that regard I am applying a discount for the utilitarian benefit of the plea in accordance with the guideline judgment from 1999 of Thomson and Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309, also reported at 49 NSWLR 383. In 2009 Justice Howie shortly before his retirement in the decision of Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102 summarised the relevant principles that played from Thomson and Houlton and subsequent cases concerning the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty and how it was to be assessed at [32] of that judgment.
	
	
	The crime that the offender committed, particularised, is that the offender in the early hours of 16 October 2016 did break and enter the dwelling house of Tamicka-Jayde Pols, situated at 151 Burke Street, Broken Hill and then in the said dwelling house did commit a serious indictable offence to wit intimidate the said Tamicka-Jayde Pols in circumstances of aggravation, to wit he was armed with an offensive weapon, to wit a 21 centimetre serrated steak knife. The knife in question is photographed, the photograph being one of the exhibits on the sentence proceedings and is a type of knife that one would find in a domestic context in a kitchen or whatever as the charge states, used for cutting steak or meat.
	
	
	The facts of the matter are set out in an agreed statement of facts. I will summarise them but there are some points to be made about it as they relate to assessing the objective gravity of this offence, bearing in mind it has a standard non-parole period in accordance with s 54A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. That is in Division 1A of Part 4 of that Act. I am required to assess the objective seriousness of the offence by relationship to an offence to be assessed within the middle range of objective seriousness. Although Way v R, the 2004 judgment of Chief Justice Spigelman, was in essence set aside by the High Court in the decision of Muldrock v R, thus leading to amendment to the legislation and our current provision to which I am about to refer, one of the things that the Chief Justice noted was that the middle range of objective seriousness was “not necessarily a narrow band”. Whether that dictum remains in light of the judgment of the High Court I cannot say with certainty, but it stands to reason that the middle range of objective seriousness may not involve a “narrow band” or a “line” but may cover a range of activities. It is still common for Judges in the Supreme Court and the District Court and Judges in the Court of Criminal Appeal to identify offences as fitting within the middle range of objective seriousness, either at the upper end of the band, in the middle of the band, or at the lower end of the band. Be that as it may I have concluded in this matter that the objective seriousness of this offending is below the middle range of objective seriousness, primarily for these reasons.
	
	
	Firstly, dealing with the matter by reference to the pleadings the serious indictable offence that the offender committed was the offence of “intimidation”. That carries a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. I am not saying intimidation is not a serious offence in context, and his own counsel said that it was a “serious case” of intimidation, but the truth of the matter is there is a range of conduct contemplated to be committed as a serious indictable offence pursuant to s 112. Having regard to the issue of the maximum penalty of the relevant serious indictable offence then the serious indictable offence of intimidation can be seen very much at the very lowest end of the scale of offences contemplated. One could commit the offence of breaking and entering and commit the offence of sexual intercourse without consent, a far more serious offence in its terms and in its objective gravity, than the offence with which I am concerned by reference to its maximum penalty. There are many other examples that could be stated.
	
	
	The other aspect of the matter that is important to bear in mind is whilst this was a forced breaking, as the facts make clear, and whilst in no way am I suggesting that the offender’s intoxication which was very heavy is a “mitigating factor”, the facts themselves speak of an important point to be made about the character of the intimidation and how it came to pass. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused’s broke into the premises in the forced way that he did in order to intimidate this particular victim. I make that finding based not on the say so of the prisoner who gave evidence before me but on the agreed facts that have been presented to the Court.
	
	
	The prisoner earlier the day before 15 October had apparently been at some licensed premises or some other premises where people were celebrating the Grand Final of the local ‘8 ball competition’. I take this to be some sort of Pool competition. A group of people ultimately wound up at the home of Ms Pols. She had some young children in the house but there is no evidence that the prisoner knew at the time or even was concerned about the fact that she had children in the house. These people included a person called Travis Murphy, another person called Carlton Staker and another person called Andrew Jones. As the facts reveal Mr Murphy, at least, knew the accused. The accused forced his way in by breaking the lock and shattering the bottom door of the back door. I did not realise this, and it is not clear on the facts, but it transpires and I am prepared to accept it, the prisoner actually lived to the rear of the premises in which the victim lived. Apparently his premises were separated by a lane.
	
	
	But the prisoner did not break in because he just happened to be a neighbour and wanted to go and intimidate Ms Pols. He came into the premises armed with the serrated steak knife intoxicated and slurring his words and waving the knife around in a reckless manner. Ms Pols felt immediate fear. Not only for her safety but for the safety of her two children. But as I said there is absolutely no suggestion the prisoner knew the children were in the house or in any way threatened them. What the prisoner then yelled, and this is part of the agreed facts, is “Who wants to fuck my missus”. Now it is a matter that common sense would dictate, in the circumstances, that there is no suggestion that anybody who said something about the accused’s partner earlier in the evening, which is the effect of the prisoner’s evidence, would have included Ms Pols. It is clear that the prisoner was directing that comment to the male people in the building or in the house. Ms Pols tried to be conciliatory. In fairness to her she was within her own home and the fact that this offence was committed within her own home I accept is an aggravating factor. But it is an aggravating factor to be seen in the context that it seems to me that the prisoner came armed with a knife to confront some males or a male, not the victim.
	
	
	The victim said to the prisoner who obviously she knew, “Darryl, I don’t know what it is wrong man but I have kids”. That would be the first he became aware of ‘kids’ being present. He already had a knife there in the house, “Just put down the knife and go home”. Mr Murphy who apparently knew the prisoner tried to placate the offender to no avail. He said “Come on mate, it’s me Trav, let’s sit down and have a civil conversation, put the knife down”. Then Pols said “You’ve got to get the fuck out of my house man, you’ve got to go”. This comment apparently angered the prisoner. But he had no right to be angry. He said these words, “You think you’re fucking tough do you, I will show you who’s tough”, lunging with the knife and Pols stepping left to avoid being stabbed. This lunging with the knife is the relevant act of intimidation. It is a serious act of intimidation to intimidate someone with a weapon. But we come back to an assessment of the seriousness of this offending.
	
	
	If the prisoner had entered the premises with the intention, in my view, of intimidating Pols at the point of breaking into her house then I might take a different view of the case. It seems to me that the breaking into the house was followed by the subsequent “lunging” at Pols in circumstances where it seemed, as I said, that the prisoner’s primary purpose was to confront somebody who made some insulting comment or made some statement that obviously offended the prisoner. He gave evidence to that effect and I accept, as best he could remember due to his intoxication, what he said about that aspect of the matter, that is that his confrontation at the house, arose out of an earlier incident on the night. In any event Mr Jones intervened as well, the prisoner yelled out “You want to have a fucking go mate” and ran towards Jones. Then Pols ran into the room and grabbed a baseball bat. But in the meantime Mr Murphy persuaded the prisoner to leave the premises although he must have gone reluctantly. Unfortunately for Mr Murphy who was a guest in the house Ms Pols pushed both Murphy and the prisoner outside and shut the door. Another point to be made about the facts of the case, the intimidation was completed at that point. There is no suggestion in the facts that the man Murphy and the prisoner were “pushed”...”outside” that the prisoner further threatened the victim with the knife so that the intimidation had finished.
	
	
	The facts state that the prisoner somehow ended up in the alleyway at the back, the prisoner jumping over the back fence it would seem, jumped on the bonnet of a car, fell off the bonnet and onto the ground. The police came and arrested him and he made full admissions in relation to the offence which is to his credit. His plea of guilty was entered at the first reasonable opportunity. He apologised to this Court for his conduct and I accept that in those circumstances he has taken responsibility for his conduct and is relevantly contrite, a mitigating factor under s 21A(3) of the Act.
	
	
	The prisoner has a criminal history that does not do him any credit. He has a criminal history that goes back to the Children’s Court in 2003, many of his offences are concerned with misconduct in relation to motor vehicles although he has a conviction for common assault in January 2014 in New South Wales for which he received an 18 month good behaviour bond. He has a conviction of resisting police for which he received a bond at the same time. He has a finding of guilt in the Children’s Court of a common assault, but I propose to disregard it given its age and the fact that he was a juvenile. He has findings of guilt in South Australia as well, I hasten to say many of these relate to conduct involving breaches of orders to keep the peace, trespass, some findings of guilt in relation to misuse of motor vehicles. He was in fact in 2011 in breach of a Community Service Order which led to a further Community Service Order being made. He does have findings of guilt in relation to carrying an offensive weapon in 2002. So ultimately, whilst his criminal history is not an aggravating factor, he has a criminal history which does him no credit, but does not necessarily disentitle him to some leniency in this matter. I note he has never previously appeared in the District Court either in New South Wales or in South Australia. The last finding of guilt that I have recorded in New South Wales is a conviction in July 2014 in the Broken Hill Local Court. His last conviction in South Australia, or last finding of guilt in South Australia, as many of the findings of guilt do not necessarily result in a conviction, is a finding of guilt in November 2014 in relation to driving with what we would call in New South Wales ‘a prescribed concentration of alcohol’ and the “unauthorised drive motor vehicle on road” for which he was convicted.
	
	
	One feature of his criminal history, however, that is a common theme it seems, and it seems to be confirmed too by the evidence he gave before me, was that many of his offences are related to his abuse of alcohol. It is quite clear that his use of alcohol and the fact that he cannot handle his alcohol and the fact that he resorts either to violence or other criminal activity when affected by alcohol is a matter of considerable concern. He expressed some concern about it, but it should be seen as probably more of a concern to the community. Particularly having regard to the circumstances of the offence with which I am concerned because the victim did not deserve in any way to have her property violated.
	
	
	Community Corrections have prepared for the Court two reports. The first report was less than helpful because it reflected on 10 March 2017 a lack of cooperation on the part of the prisoner. However there is a further report prepared for this sitting of the District Court of 18 August 2017. It notes what was confirmed by the prisoner in his evidence that he lives in Broken Hill with his partner, she has two children from a previous relationship, she is now pregnant with their first child. The prisoner has two children from previous relationships. He has, on his account, had an upbringing that involved some dysfunction in his background, particularly the abuse of alcohol by his father, some neglect and he experienced some domestic violence. This offence I am dealing with of course is not a domestic violence offence.
	
	
	I accept that in between appearances in court he has from time to time been able to gather employment and has various what I would call “trade based skills” that make him attractive to employers and I accept from the evidence produced today in an application form he has prepared and in a reference that was provided by a job placement consultant of 21 August 2017, that he has employment as a roofing labourer which will enable him to work in the construction of some form of wind farm near Broken Hill over the next 12 months. However the Community Corrections Service, consistent with the prisoner’s own evidence, notes his longstanding history of binge drinking, bearing in mind he is 33 years of age, or thereabouts, and this is a history that goes back 15 years. It shows that throughout his adulthood he has abused alcohol and there are aspects of his abuse which have led to not only the commission of offences but blackouts on his part and also a number of physical injuries whilst intoxicated. It may be that in many respects he has done more damage to himself than to others over this period of time.
	
	
	The prisoner relates his prior actions in terms of his criminal conduct, particularly offences committed in New South Wales at an earlier time, to a breakdown of a relationship he had. His present partner herself says that when intoxicated he can behave in what is described as a “nasty”, “threatening” and “intimidating manner”. He has really to change his conduct. Certainly he has to change his drinking habits. In fact the best advice I could give him, although I am not here to give him any advice, is to give up drinking alcohol altogether. He will save himself a lot of money and he will save himself the potential risk as is evidenced by his criminal history in this matter of committing criminal offences.
	
	
	His partner has sought to give him ultimatums and the like. He has cut down his drinking, she says, to one or two stubbies of beer after work. But it seems to me, if I be so bold to say so, that if he is an “alcoholic” he should follow the mantra of all those that have had any association with Alcoholics Anonymous, which therapy he has been encouraged to undertake, although he refuses to do so, and admit that he is an alcoholic and understand that as long as he drinks alcohol he is at risk of relapsing back into further binge drinking and alcohol abuse.
	
	
	I note the fact that despite his significant history of drinking and the effect upon him of drinking the prisoner undertook counselling only for a short period of time and has not availed himself of attendance at the local Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. I would encourage him to undertake that. It may well be that it will be a requirement of him of Community Corrections if he wants to keep his liberty. I understand, without accepting it as an excuse, that the prisoner explains that his ceasing of counselling and his failure to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings has been somewhat associated with the strain of trying to maintain employment. But there are matters where prioritising one’s commitments sometimes involves making sacrifices for the improvement of one’s personal circumstances.
	
	
	He is assessed at medium risk of reoffending. He has previously successfully completed supervision and the assessment of the Community Corrections Office is that he presents with a chronic alcohol abuse problem characterised by a longstanding binge drinking pattern and despite acknowledging his use of alcohol as problematic he has displayed a lack of insight, minimising the effects of his drinking and ceasing attendance for counselling after the two appointments that I have referred to. However he is nevertheless assessed as being suitable for supervision by Community Corrections and is likely to benefit from counselling programs to address his alcohol abuse and associated violence.
	
	
	My own view of the matter is that one of the reasons that Community Corrections feels that he is still capable of responding to supervision is the fact that he is a person who can find employment, which is a positive sign, and secondly it seems to be, on the evidence available to me, that he is in a stable domestic relationship, albeit that he was in that domestic relationship when he committed this offence.
	
	
	I have had regard to the fact too, in his favour, that a condition of his current employment with the ‘ProTech’ organisation which is building the wind farm is that he is required to undertake daily drug and alcohol testing and a recent test that was undertaken, as I understand it, on 22 August 2017 reveals negative results. I do not have any real history of problematic drug use, although that could be in the background too. But certainly alcohol testing and drug testing is a good thing to convince him to remain on the straight and narrow in that regard. If he returns a positive test in the course of his employment he will lose his employment and that he understands.
	
	
	In respect of the appropriate determination of this matter I am mindful of the fact that Div 1A Pt 4 reflects upon usually the need for a fixing of a non‑parole period in respect of an offence that has a standard non‑parole period in circumstances where term of imprisonment is to be imposed. It is the case, as his counsel conceded, that having regard to s 5 of the Act, having regard to both the character of the offending and his criminal history amongst other matters, a term of imprisonment is the only alternative available and there are no other “possible alternatives” that may be imposed.
	
	
	In that regard I am required to consider s 3A of the Act and the various purposes of sentencing that arise here, which all have some role to play to varying degrees, there is a need for general deterrence in regulation to offences of this type and an element of personal deterrence required. There is some degree to protect the community from the offender. But I do not suggest that the prisoner is a person prone to randomly break into people’s houses so as to commit crimes. His criminal history does not suggest that although he has some trespass findings in South Australia.
	
	
	I am required however to promote his rehabilitation although it must be fairly said, although he looks youthful he is not a young man any more. He is a man in his early 30s. He is older and he has to take responsibility for his actions. I have dealt with the issue of the aggravating factor under s 21A(2). I have already indicated there are few mitigating factors, but I am prepared to conclude that the injury, emotional loss and damage of the offence was not substantial, albeit that Ms Joels was greatly affected at the time. She had the presence of mind to arm herself with a baseball bat I have noted and successfully not only got rid of the prisoner but got rid of Mr Murphy, who was trying to help.
	
	
	I am prepared to accept that the offence was not a planned offence. There must have been a degree of premeditation. The prisoner obviously was festering, or stewing over the insult to his partner, which I accept had been made by somebody, but more than likely not any of the people inside the house. It had angered him and he simmered, under the influence of alcohol. But such planning as occurred was relatively rudimentary and the knife that he produced was a kitchen, domestic‑type weapon, not some weapon that could be identified as primarily designed to intimidate or threaten people.
	
	
	I cannot conclude he was a person of good character. Whilst he abuses alcohol I cannot conclude that he is unlikely to reoffend but he does have some prospects of rehabilitation, particularly if he can maintain employment, maintain his domestic relationship and not use alcohol. I have already concluded I accept that he is remorseful in the terms required by s 21A(3)(a). His plea of guilty is a mitigating factor and for that he receives a discrete discount.
	
	
	In considering the relevance of the standard non‑parole period it does provide some guidance in the manner discussed by the High Court in Muldrock from 2011 and of course s 54AB(2) of the Act indicates the proper approach to considering the relevance of the standard non‑parole period. It requires consideration of matters beyond simply the objective seriousness of the offending. As I have said, the offence, by reason of the character of the serious indictable offence and the relationship of the aggravating factor to the commission of the serious indictable offence, is a matter, in my view, well below the middle range of objective seriousness but not the least serious offence of its type, clearly not. The maximum penalty is of course a relevant guide to the appropriate penalty to be imposed hence the requirement to impose some form of term of imprisonment.
	
	
	I have already reflected upon the evidence of the prisoner. By and large I am prepared to accept most of his evidence. The Crown pressed him in relation to his insight and other related matters and I have taken that matter into account. I have taken into account the relevant submissions that have been made by Mr Kahn on his behalf. Many of them I have reflected upon in my remarks on sentence to this point.
	
	
	With regard to the Crown’s submissions, the Crown submitted to me that I should impose a term of full-time custody which would require of course the fixing of a non-parole period. There was no argument by the Crown as to a finding of special circumstances although the Crown queried his prospects of rehabilitation. I have already made observations in relation to that. The Crown conceded there was a requirement for a discount for the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty. The Crown correctly pointed out an aggravating factor was that the offence was committed in the victim’s home. As I have said one of the matters that emerges from the agreed facts in my mind is that the commission of the serious indictable offence involving the particular victim that is identified, was not the purpose of the prisoner breaking into the premises in the first instance. That does not excuse his behaviour as such.
	
	
	Ultimately I have concluded however that all things considered, particularly given the prime balance that now exists between the prisoner leading a life in future years that is lawful or continuing to conduct himself in a way which will attract more and more stringent penalties from the court, the order that I have foreshadowed may turn the balance in a way which will not only work for the benefit of the offender but work for the benefit of the community. Chief Justice King in the decision of Yardley v Betts, a decision adopted in New South Wales in a number of cases, including the 2001 decision of Blackman and Walters, observed that,
	


“Sometimes courts in sentencing offenders are required to consider the fact that if an order assists in the rehabilitation of an offender that works not just to the benefit of the offender, it works to the benefit of the community.”


	
	Because if people are deterred, or if people are persuaded from committing further offences then the community is a beneficiary of that. Of course we all know that there are some offenders who commit crimes of such seriousness that the issue of rehabilitation has very much a back seat to the true purpose of the sentencing exercise. But as I said earlier this matter was very finely balanced and I am prepared at this stage to give the prisoner the benefit of the - a greater weight to consideration of an order in due course that might permit the prisoner to remain in the community where if he does stay in employment; if he does support his family; if he does avoid further offending, will work not only for his benefit but work for the benefit of the community. Of course if he wants to continue offending well then obviously the burden will fall upon the community to maintain him whilst he is in custody. That is a price the community has to pay for particular offenders. At this particular point I have come to the conclusion it need not have to pay but still may fall to be the responsibility of the community if the prisoner is not assessed as being suitable for an intensive correction order or if the Crown appeals my order successfully, or if he fails to comply with the orders that I impose. If he fails to comply with the Intensive Correction Order, if I eventually make it, and that is not certain at this point, I still have a discretion not to make it in October this year. But if he fails to comply with the Intensive Correction Order it will not be a matter for me to determine whether he should go into custody. The Parole Authority will make that decision and he will go into custody and he will stay in custody until such time as the Parole Authority decides that he should be released, however, no later than the expiry date of the term of imprisonment that is imposed.
	
	
	Thus in all those circumstances I have concluded that I should make the order that I foreshadowed. Thus, if you will just bear with me a moment, if I can find the order. I had a form of order here but I am not quite sure where I put it. Would you stand up please Mr Auld.
	
	
	In relation to the matter of which you are for sentence, you are convicted. I have considered s 5(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and I am satisfied for the reasons given that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate and the sentence of imprisonment will be for a period of no more than two years. You are referred for assessment as to your suitability for an Intensive Correction Order as a means of serving the sentence. I refer you for assessment pursuant to s 69 of the aforementioned Act and order the preparation of an assessment report on or before 27 October 2017, that is the last Friday of October. I will continue your bail on the further condition that you attend the Broken Hill office of the Community Corrections Service before 5pm on 30 August 2017 for the preparation of the assessment report to commence. The matter is adjourned to 9.30am on Friday 27 October 2017 (as said) to enable the assessment report to be completed. I direct that you appear before me in the Sydney District Court at the Downing Centre via audio visual link at 9.30am eastern summer-time on 27 October 2017, that is 9am central summer-time. I assume it will be in summer-time by late October, it usually commences in the first weekend of October.
	
	
	I want you to understand these things however. If the assessment report is unfavourable then I will be required to impose a term of imprisonment and I am not going to contemplate a suspended term of imprisonment, I wanted you to clearly understand that. Secondly, if the assessment is favourable I still have a discretion not to impose an ICO, I can still impose a term of full-time custody and then I will contemplate the fixing of a non-parole period and I will have to hear further submissions. If there is some complication in relation to the matter that requires further attention by both the Crown and myself and your counsel. It is possible the matter may need to be further adjourned for you to come to Sydney, but if I can deal with the matter via audio visual link I shall, subject to the convenience of the parties and the like. The only reason I am granting you the indulgence of appearing via audio visual link rather than appearing before me personally is simply because I have to recognise the fact that Broken Hill is a very long way from Sydney and it would involve, on your part and the community who is no doubt funding your representation, considerable expense in requiring you to attend at the court at Sydney on the date I have fixed. If you fail to co-operate with the Community Corrections Service the assessment by the Community Correction Service will not be positive, but you would expect that, but it is a matter for you but I can assure you of one thing. If you fail to comply with their directions as you did in the past in the preparation of the Community Correction Service report that was prepared for this court, you could almost certainly assure yourself of a negative assessment report. Frankly, if I get a negative assessment, if you are not suitable for an Intensive Correction Order, my hands are completely tied. I have got no discretion to make an order that you serve an Intensive Correction Order if you are not assessed as suitable. Just take a seat just for the moment thank you.
	
	
	Madam Crown, any technical matters for you?
	
	
	TURNER: No, nothing further, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Thank you. Madam Crown, I appreciate your difficulties here in Broken Hill. You may or may not be able to appear. We’ll all have to just play it by ear on that occasion and feel free to contact my associate to see how things are going. We’ll make a not. We’ll have the file brought back to Sydney with us and I will ask my associate to make a note on the file that when we get a copy of the report we will forward it to you.
	
	
	TURNER: Thank you, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I’ve been telling representatives of the Director of Public Prosecutions for 15 or 16 years to tell either Mr Cowdery or Mr Babb that from my perspective pre‑sentence reports should be provided to the Crown before they’re provided to the Court and I don’t know why that doesn’t happen.
	
	
	TURNER: It’s difficult.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I’m continually astonished that the Director of Public Prosecutions’ representatives who have to tender the reports only see them after they’re produced to the Court. I think they should all be sent to the Director’s office and the Director’s office can make further enquiries about them if need be and have time to consider them. I don’t think it’s quite fair that they’re sent to the Court beforehand. Anyway, nothing is happening in that regard, so the system continues as it is. I just don’t think it’s right.
	
	
	Mr Auld, do you understand what I’ve done?
	
	
	OFFENDER: You’ve extended my bond two months.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: No, no, I haven’t extended your bond for two months at all. I haven't given you a bond.
	
	
	OFFENDER: I thought I’d get a bond to be of good behaviour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I beg your pardon?
	
	
	OFFENDER: I thought the bond continued from what I had.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: No, what I’ve done is I’ve continued your bail for two months.
	
	
	OFFENDER: Bail yeah, not a bond, sorry.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: On the basis that you report to Community Corrections within seven days. I would suggest that you report as soon as you can. Then cooperate with the Community Corrections Service in the preparation of a report, but you are to appear before me at 9am, central summer time, Friday, 27 October by audio-visual link. Your solicitor will have to bring you to Court and the appropriate arrangements will have to be made and we’ll see where we go from there. All right. Just take a seat for the moment. Thank you very much, Mr Auld, your bail continues, you don’t need to - I’ll get my associate to give you a bail continuation form and then you can leave. So just take a seat.

		13 November 2017",2017-08-22 00:00:00,NSW District Court
6454067,R v Read [2017] NSWDC 322,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: The accused in a trial listed to commence today makes application for a permanent stay of proceedings.
	
	
	The decision whether or not to grant a stay of the prosecution of a criminal offence involves consideration of competing important principles.
	
	
	It is well established that it is in the interests of justice that people charged with criminal offences should be tried. Those charged with criminal offences should not obtain immunities from prosecution. There is a public administration in the due administration of the criminal law. The interests of the accused have to be balanced with those of the community and the community’s right to expect that people charged with criminal offences are brought to trial. The courts will not allow themselves to be instruments or oppression, or allow proceedings to continue where they are abuse of a court’s processes.
	
	
	Mr Bonnici, who appears for Mr Read, sought a stay on a number of grounds. In the course of discussions, I ruled that the grounds which I would consider are those which I have just mentioned, involving questions as to whether proceedings are oppressive or an abuse of the court’s processes.
	
	
	The accused is to be indicted on a count of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm. He was charged with that offence some time ago now. After charge, there were committal proceedings. He was committed for trial to the Taree District Court, but his trial was not reached there on two occasions. In order to ensure that his trial was reached on the next occasion, the matter was listed as a special fixture in the Newcastle District Court. A seven day trial before Judge Frearson and a jury was then held. This trial resulted in the jury being unable to agree upon a verdict and they were discharged without verdict.
	
	
	It is an unfortunate state of affairs that defending oneself against a criminal charge is a terribly expensive matter. Mr Read is funding his own legal representation, he does not qualify for legal aid. I have little difficulty in accepting that Mr Read has already spent a great deal of money on his legal representation, especially in circumstances where two earlier trials have been not reached and a trial resulted in a hung jury.
	
	
	And then, of course, in a case of this kind, there are the need to obtain expert reports, which again are far from cheap. There are some small ways in which some of that expense can be ameliorated, such as through applications under the Suitors Fund, but such applications do little to offset the enormous expense of defending a criminal charge.
	
	
	One particular matter that Mr Bonnici raised was the cost of transcript. His client does not have the transcript of the trial before Judge Frearson because that does not come free to him. The Crown gets it for free and I get it for free too, but the way justice is administered in New South Wales is such that if an accused wants a transcript of an aborted trial he or she has to pay for it. Nor is transcript cheap.
	
	
	The result is that I accept that Mr Read has spent a great deal of money and will spend a great deal more in the event that Mr Bonnici’s application is refused.
	
	
	But there is a difference between things being expensive and things being oppressive. It is not oppressive, in my view, for an accused to face trial on a second occasion where a jury has not agreed at the first trial, even taking into account the other expenses arising from the not reached trials, the expert reports and the committal proceedings. Expensive, yes, but oppressive, no.
	
	
	No particulars of expense were provided to me but I proceed it on the basis, as I have indicated, that a great deal of money is involved.
	
	
	Mr Bonnici’s application regarding his submission that the continuation of proceedings is an abuse of the court’s processes was based on the proposition that the charge the prosecution brings against Mr Read is doomed to fail. I pass over the suggestion that if it was doomed to fail one might have expected an acquittal at the first trial and move on to my consideration as to the evidence which will be put before a jury if the stay application is refused.
	
	
	The accused was driving his truck along a roadway where the speed limit was 110 kilometres an hour. Ahead of him was a man on a tractor mowing the grass verge. He is the person who suffered grievous bodily harm as a result of what the Crown said is the accused’s dangerous driving.
	
	
	Mr Hughes was the tractor driver. Between Mr Hughes on his tractor and the accused in his truck were two vehicles. One was described as a “shadow vehicle” and another was a vehicle in which a Mr Newell sat. A driver approaching Mr Hughes on his tractor would first pass Mr Newell in his vehicle. His vehicle was parked to the side of the road. A photograph of the appearance of that vehicle from the rear was tendered on this application. It shows that Mr Newell was in a white utility vehicle with a trailer behind him. The trailer had a number of relevant signs.
	
	
	Firstly, there is an illuminated sign where the display changes. The sign reads “Merge right” with some chevrons pointing to the right underneath. Then the word “Lane” appears, then the word “Closed” appears. Underneath that sign is a speed limit sign indicating 80 kilometres per hour ahead, that sign in the standard format of black letters on a white background with a red circle around them. The appearance of the trailer is largely yellow.
	
	
	I am told also that there were flashing orange lights, although they do not appear to be visible in the photograph tendered.
	
	
	After a motorist passes Mr Newell’s vehicle he or she approaches what was described as “the shadow vehicle”. It was a large truck. Mounted behind the truck was a deformable barrier brightly painted with red and white chevrons and what appear to be flashing orange lights. Mounted on the truck itself was an illuminating sign, indicating the speed limit of 80 due to road work. In fact, what was on the sign are the numerals “80” and underneath the words “Roadwork”   On top of that sign was another display with flashing orange lights, which, it is accepted, were displaying a flashing arrow pointing to the right, indicating to the driver the need to move into the right lane.
	
	
	Mr Read, it seems to be common ground, did not see Mr Newell’s vehicle as he approached it and then went past it. When he came up behind the shadow vehicle it is the defence case that he could not move to the right because of the presence of motorbikes to his right. Accordingly, he moved to the left where, shortly thereafter, he collided with Mr Hughes on his tractor.
	
	
	That is the way I understand the Crown case from the evidence put before me today.
	
	
	The evidence put before me by Mr Bonnici consists of photographs taken from the dash cam in Mr Newell’s vehicle, photographs of the rear of
	
	
	Mr Newell’s vehicle and a single photograph of the shadow truck. There was also tendered what was described as a folder index which was intended to convey to me what could have been done better by those in charge to avoid collisions of the type which did occur.
	
	
	Mr Bonnici filed a number of matters in the sense that he gave them to a different judge last week but I rejected the tender of one of those documents, the no bill application, written by Mr Bonnici and sent to the DPP and did not find it necessary to consider other things which Mr Bonnici proposed to tender, Mr Bonnici being content, to proceed on the basis that I would accept the factual matters on which he relied for the purposes of this application.
	
	
	I made it clear, in the course of submissions, for the purposes of this application I do accept that matters could have been done better and I will be a bit more specific about what could have been done better in a little while.
	
	
	I was told and there seemed to be no dispute about this also, that
	
	
	Mr Newell was not paying attention to passing traffic. There was reference to Mr Newell looking at something on his computer. Of course, that is certainly not in Mr Newell’s favour but, as is obvious, even if he had been paying attention, it would not have altered the appearance of his vehicle, which was parked approximately 300 metres before the tractor which Mr Hughes was using to mow the grass verge.
	
	
	Mr Newell’s vehicle and, even more so, the trailer behind it, was a highly visible warning of the need for caution to be exercised due to some unspecified hazard ahead. The trailer sign advised a motorist to merge right because a lane was closed and that the speed limit would drop from 110 kilometres an hour to 80 kilometres an hour ahead. Although the shadow vehicle had the apparent function of protecting those in it and a person mowing the grass verge on a tractor by absorbing any impacts, it is also a highly visible warning of a hazard, with the clear specification that the speed limit is 80 kilometres an hour due to road work.
	
	
	The Crown case is that the accused was driving dangerously in that he failed to see the warnings on Mr Newell’s vehicle at all and did not see the shadow vehicle in sufficient time to allow him to respond appropriately to its presence on the road.
	
	
	To be considered dangerous, the way in which an accused person drove has to be proved by the Crown to be such that that driving was a serious breach of the proper conduct of a motor vehicle, so serious as to be, in reality and not merely as a matter of speculation, potentially dangerous to another person or persons.
	
	
	The manner of driving, of course, refers to things such as what the driver looks at, whether the driver steers the vehicle properly, does the driver brake or slow down, does the driver stop when he should stop and go when he should go. Indeed, the manner of driving encompasses all the sorts of things a driver does or should do as part of driving a motor vehicle.
	
	
	The way an accused person, charged with an offence such as this, drove would be dangerous if the Crown establishes beyond reasonable doubt that there has been a serious breach of the proper management and control of a motor vehicle and that the breach is so serious that it creates a real danger to another person or persons in the vicinity.
	
	
	It is the risk of harm which is important, rather than the result of the driving, when deciding whether driving, in particular circumstances, is dangerous.
	
	
	I mentioned before the presence of motorcycles on the roadway. It is, as I understand the defence case advanced on behalf of Mr Read, that it was the presence of those motorbikes which caused him to miss seeing Mr Newell’s vehicle and, when he came up behind the shadow vehicle, prevented him from moving into the right lane, leaving him with only the option of moving left into the breakdown lane, where, unbeknownst to him, Mr Hughes was on his tractor.
	
	
	The four photographs taken from Mr Newell’s dash cam are helpful. The last of those photographs shows the truck driven by Mr Read as it comes into the dash cam’s field of view. Mr Read’s truck is in lane 1, the motorbikes, at least the one closest to the camera, is in lane 2 and there is some distance between the closest motorbike and Mr Read’s truck. That photograph tends to suggest that any hazard presented by the motorbikes had passed at the time Mr Read approached Mr Newell’s vehicle and passed it.
	
	
	I mention that matter because of the need for me to consider whether, as Mr Bonnici suggests, these proceedings are foredoomed to fail.
	
	
	On the evidence before me today, the Crown case is a strong one. The warnings provided by Mr Newell’s trailer are hard to miss and the presence of the motorbikes, while perhaps a distraction earlier along the roadway, seem to have passed by the time Mr Read approached Mr Newell’s vehicle.
	
	
	As I said earlier, I accept, for the purpose of this application, that many things could have been done better by those in charge. Things such as witches hats could have blocked lane 1, the witches hats being placed in a way which would gradually cause a vehicle to move from lane 1 into lane 2. There could have been better signs, there could have been more signs and more vehicles to protect Mr Hughes on his tractor. But, just because things could have been done better, it does not necessarily mean that, as Mr Bonnici seems to have assumed, that his client was not driving dangerously.
	
	
	The Crown relies not only on the failure to see Mr Newell’s vehicle but also the failure to see the shadow vehicle in time to avoid colliding with it. The shadow vehicle is again brightly coloured and a driver looking ahead would have seen it for some distance away.
	
	
	I assess this case as being a strong one. Certainly, on my consideration of the evidence, this is far from a case where it can be said that the Crown case is foredoomed to fail.
	
	
	I, therefore, reject the two grounds relied on by Mr Bonnici for a permanent stay of proceedings. The trial will, therefore, proceed.

		15 November 2017",2017-06-12 00:00:00,NSW District Court
6454077,"R v YOUNAN, Ronny [2016] NSWDC 436","JUDGMENT


	
	HIS HONOUR: I propose to order that a certificate issue to Ronny Younan and I give my judgment now.
	
	
	Introduction
	
	
	Ronny Younan was arraigned on 29 August 2016 in relation to a charge that he on or about 9 May 2015 at Surry Hills in the State of New South Wales knowingly took part in the supply of a prohibited drug, namely 24 grams of cocaine pursuant to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. He was acquitted of that count on 1 September 2016 with a jury returning a unanimous verdict of not guilty.
	
	
	The applicant now seeks pursuant to s 2 Costs in Criminal Cases Act, 1967 (the “Act”) a certificate in respect of the matter for which he was acquitted. In relation to the pursuit of the application it was foreshadowed after the verdict of not guilty that an application would be made by learned counsel for the then accused or now the applicant. The matter was stood over for a date to be fixed. The matter came before me yesterday morning at 9.30 in the middle of a criminal trial I was conducting and I resolved that I should give judgment in the matter the following day as I now do.
	
	
	I was provided with helpful written submissions and some additional oral submissions from both the learned counsel for the accused and the learned counsel for the Director of Public Prosecutions. I also received an affidavit not objected to by the respondent to this application annexing various material which constituted what I would regard as additional evidence admissible under s 3A of the Act. The Crown did not specifically tender any such additional material but in the written submissions there was reference to material that was not evidence at the trial which I have taken into account pursuant to s 3A of the Act.
	
	
	Course of the trial
	
	
	With regard to the proceedings in the trial it was a relatively short trial. The essence of the Crown case was that patrolling police saw a motor vehicle that was driven by the accused and in which the accused’s cousin Moussa Haddad was seated in the passenger’s seat in the Surry Hills area. The vehicle was followed in a route up Albion Street and left into Bourke Street almost adjacent to the old St Margaret’s Hospital and it was alleged from the evidence of the police that a person called Timothy Mitchell waved towards the car, the car pulled into the kerb nearby to where Mr Mitchell was. Police activated their lights and pulled up behind the car driven by the accused. Mr Mitchell walked away but to be apprehended by police nearby. Two police officers, Constables Griffin and Cochrane, approached the motor vehicle. Mr Haddad was seen to be trying to hide some object between his legs. The accused sitting in the driver’s seat when approached raised the window of his motor vehicle. Both men were removed from the motor vehicle and in the area of the passenger seat where Haddad had been seated police found a plastic bag containing fifty smaller resealable bags containing what was ultimately detected to be cocaine weighing in total 24 grams.
	
	
	The Crown case was that the accused was knowingly taking part in the attempted sale or distribution of the cocaine by driving the car. I will come back to the way in which the Crown case was put to the jury with the Crown’s consent in a moment. The vehicle being driven by the accused was a rental car but subsequent investigations revealed that it was a car that had been rented about three months before to a relative of the accused on a long term rental arrangement. I should say in passing the character of the ownership of the car whilst initially appearing to be an issue in the case was never agitated as a relevant issue. Bearing in mind matters raised by the accused when he was interviewed about his possession of the car and the reasons for not driving his own motor vehicle appear unchallenged. The accused was arrested, he was taken to the police station and some hours later was interviewed. In his interview, which I will deal with when I deal with the facts of the case as I find them, he denied his guilt in relation to the matter in that he denied knowledge of the presence of drugs in the car, denied that he was involved in distribution of drugs or participating in the distribution of drugs. Evidence was led through the police that he was a person of no prior convictions with no prior charges. Timothy Mitchell gave evidence as did three police officers denying that he waved at any motor vehicle, that he was in Surry Hills to purchase prohibited drugs or that he was in any way connected with Mr Haddad.
	
	
	In that respect, so far as the Crown case is concerned. I take the point that was raised in submissions that some critical matters are not adverted to in its summary but I will deal with that when I deal with the fact finding. There is no need for me to exhaustively summarise the evidence. The particular matter, I should point out, raised on behalf of the applicant, was that when Mr Mitchell gave evidence he said that he had no knowledge of Haddad’s identity, no intention to purchase prohibited drugs and other matters.
	
	
	Mr Mitchell I point out was spoken to by police. I excluded evidence of conversations with Mr Mitchell purportedly conducted by a police officer, who did not give evidence in the trial I take it consequent upon my ruling. I point out in relation to Mr Mitchell that his telephone was taken away from him in circumstances I am a little unclear about. He remotely wiped his phone. He said in evidence before me in the trial, which I accept, to protect the privacy of his information, given what on its face would appear to be highly unsatisfactory explanations for his phone being taken away from him in the first place. In any event Mr Mitchell before the trial gave a statement on 24 August 2016 which essentially reflects the evidence he gave before me at the trial. That is that he did not wave the car driven by the accused over. He was not buying drugs, he in fact states that it was put to him that he was trying to buy drugs which he “denied” and explained the circumstances of his phone being taken away from him.
	
	
	The charge that the accused was prosecuted upon was a charge of knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug. That required proof of knowing participation in the supply of the prohibited drug cocaine in the possession of Mr Haddad. I instructed the jury, with no disagreement from the Crown, that the Prosecution had to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused intentionally was involved in relevant acts related to and concerned with an attempt to sell or distribute cocaine by Mr Haddad to Mr Timothy Mitchell whether for financial benefit or otherwise. This was not a case the Crown made clear of “joint possession”. It boiled down to what the Crown has described as a circumstantial evidence case requiring the drawing of a conclusion of guilt. That is a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt of particular facts. The particular facts required to be established from the drawing of inferences were firstly that the accused knew that Mr Haddad was in possession of a prohibited drug subsequently found by police. Secondly that when he drove the vehicle which was stopped by the police to the side of the road before being spoken to by the police he knew that Mr Haddad was intending to sell or distribute a prohibited drug. Thirdly he did so as a step or act towards the sale or distribution of a prohibited drug and fourthly, Mr Haddad was intending at that time to sell or distribute a prohibited drug to Mr Mitchell.
	
	
	The accused, as I earlier said, raised his good character and the jury were given a character direction in relation to the matter (I interpose in my remarks on judgment to just point out for the purposes of the record that it is half past 12, I have just sent my jury away for the day being a Friday, I have fixed the delivery of this judgment this time because I have a number of sentence matters after 2 o'clock today. As I set out my reasons, I will refer to particular legislation but I do not propose to actually read it out in the delivery of the judgment. When I revise the judgment I will include the relevant legislation and some of the relevant principles from the cases but I will certainly identify the sources of the particular matters to which I refer.
	
	
	Relevant legislation and principles
	
	
	The power to issue a certificate under the Act arises under s 2 and s 3 of the Act. The Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967 relevantly provides:
	
	
	s.2 The Court or Judge ….. in any proceedings relating to an offence … punishable … upon indictment may -
	


(a) where a defendant, after a hearing on the merits, is acquitted … as to the information then under inquiry ….. grant to that defendant a certificate under this Act, specifying the matters referred to in s.3 relating to those proceedings.


	
	s.3 (1) a certificate granted under this Act shall specify that, in the opinion of the Court …… granting the certificate –
	


(a) if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, been in possession of evidence of all the relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings; and

(b) that any act or omission of the defendant that contributed or might have contributed, to the institution or continuation of the proceedings was reasonable in the circumstances”.


	
	I am required to determine that if the prosecution had before the proceedings were instituted been in possession of evidence of all of the relevant facts it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings and that no act or omission of the applicant contributed to or might have contributed to the institution or continuation of the proceedings.
	
	
	In relation to that second matter, I received some detailed submissions about that aspect of the matter from the applicant not from the Crown. No issue was taken that there was any act or omission of the applicant that contributed to or might have contributed to the institution or continuation of the proceedings.
	
	
	Section 3A(1) of the Act defines “all the relevant facts” as:
	


The relevant facts established in the proceedings, and any relevant facts that the defendant has, on the application for the certificate, established to the satisfaction of the Court or Judge or Magistrate, and any relevant facts that the prosecutor, or in the absence of the prosecutor, any person authorised to represent the Minister on the application, has established to the satisfaction of the Court or Judge or Magistrate that:

i.    relate to evidence that was in the possession of the prosecutor at the time that the decision to institute proceedings was made, and

ii.    were not adduced in the proceedings.


	
	In relation to s 3A, I have received the material as I have earlier indicated annexed to or contained within the affidavit of the applicant’s solicitor and there was material adverted to by the learned counsel for the Crown which I will accept as additional material, if that is the correct expression, to that available at trial.
	
	
	With regard to the relevant principles to be applied in relation to the issue of a certificate, the judgment of Justice McColl of the Court of Appeal in Mordaunt v DDP [2007] NSWCCA 121 particularly at [36] summarises a number of principles that have arisen from quite a number of cases decided by the Court of Criminal Appeal over many years going back to and in some instances before the important decision of Allerton v Director Public Prosecutions (1991) 24 NSWLR 550, particularly, the observations of the Court at 559G-560B which passage I will not recite.
	
	
	At [36] of Mordaunt her Honour set out at least 14 matters for consideration that are determined by previous cases. I will place within the judgment those matters but for the purposes of the oral delivery of the judgment I note amongst other things the discussion of the purpose of the Act, the discussion of the institution of proceedings, the onus being upon the applicant to show that it was not reasonable institute the proceedings, the task of the Court dealing with the application to ask the hypothetical question “If the prosecution had evidence of all the relevant facts immediately before the proceedings were instituted would it not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings” which includes facts obtained before charging, after charging, during trial, after acquittal if additional material was adduced by the parties pursuant to s 3A. The applicant must succeed on what is described as both the “facts issue” and the “reasonableness issue” and in that regard in my judgment I will identify the relevant facts I found and deal with the issue of reasonableness in the context of those facts.
	
	
	With regard to the issue of reasonableness of the learned judge of the Court of Appeal identified matters set out at [36(h)(n)] in Mordaunt as being “germane” or at least essential or relevant to that determination. Her Honour noted from the authorities that the reasonableness of the decision to institute proceedings is not based upon the test that prosecution agencies use for the discretionary test for continuing to prosecute and, in fact, there is the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Johnston [2000] NSWCCA 197 where her Honour Justice Simpson rejected the argument put in that matter that a relevant consideration in the evaluative process and the exercise of the discretion is that “It is necessary that justice be seen to be done.” She said that:
	


“The perception that justice is done is not advanced by the unreasonable institution of criminal proceedings nor those based on evidence known to be inadequate to sustain a conviction” [at 19]


	
	Justice McColl pointed out that the fact that there is a prima facie case does not mean it is reasonable to launch a prosecution, on the other hand the fact that a Court concluded that evidence was insufficient to warrant a conviction is not necessarily indicative of unreasonableness as neither is the entering of a judgment of acquittal. She referred to the fact that s 3 of the Act calls for an objective analysis of the whole of the relevant evidence noting as the Crown has noted in its submissions:
	
	
	“Matters of judgment concerning credibility demeanour and the like are likely to fall on the other side of the line of unreasonableness being matters quintessentially in the realm of the element fact finder.”
	
	
	In other words, matters for calling for judgment turning upon the credibility, demeanour and the like of particular witnesses would aid the Crown’s resistance to an application of this type because it would be seen to be a matter reasonably to be left to a jury to determine. There are other observations made as I said within that judgment which I can include in due course.
	
	
	With regard to some other authorities cited, I have noted reference to the decision of Groom (2000) NSWCCA 538 and in the decision of Pavy, an unreported decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal of 9 December 1997 that is cited in Groom. Justice Blanch sitting on the Court of Criminal Appeal in the decision of McFarlane (unreported 12 August 1994) observed that:
	


“A hypothetical exercise in the sense the question is whether it would have been reasonable to prosecute at the time of the institution of the proceedings if the hypothetical prosecutor had possession of evidence of all the relevant facts including those established even after the trial and on the application.”


	
	Justice Simpson, in her judgment in Johnston to which I earlier referred at [16] noted the stages of the processes being firstly, an evaluation of all of the evidences that emerged at trial and other evidence admissible under s 3A an assumption that all the evidence was available to the prosecution before the proceedings were instituted, a determination then whether, if the prosecution had been in possession of all the evidence, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings, a determination whether any act or omission of the accused contributed to the commencement of or the continuation of the proceedings and where such an act or omission is found to exist a determination whether that act or omission was in the circumstances reasonable. These principles are cited in various ways by the parties to emphasise particular matters that are not in dispute.
	
	
	Submissions
	
	
	With regard to submissions of the parties very briefly, I have obviously had regard to all the submissions that have been put, I have noted what the parties have said about their understanding of the law. Essentially, what is put on behalf of the accused is that the trial was conducted and the evidence available for consideration at this point did not involve a situation where any witness did not come up to proof. The Crown was on notice that Mr Mitchell would deny any intention to purchase drugs off Haddad or any knowledge of Haddad. The defence submitted at its evidentiary height the Crown case was “quite fatally flawed” and that there was no “reasonable prospect of obtaining a conviction.”
	
	
	It pointed to the fact that there were a number “reasonable hypotheses” consistent with the applicant’s innocence which the Crown could not exclude there being a paucity of evidence particularly on the accused’s knowledge upon which a jury could convict. As I have earlier referred to in passing it was submitted the accused’s acts or omissions had not contributed to the commencement or the continuation of the proceedings pointing to his cooperation with the police investigation, his explanation of his presence in the car in the course of the electronic interview. The fact that all the matters that he raised in the interview were independently investigated and confirmed. He permitted his telephone to be examined. He instructed his lawyers to make a no bill submission, sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions on 12 February 2016 setting out the bases for which he should be acquitted.
	
	
	With regard to the Crown’s submissions after summarising its view of the evidence and as I said referring to legal principles, the Crown essentially submitted that the disparities between the evidence given by Mr Mitchell and the observations claimed by Constables Cochran and Griffin, that is, the two police officers in the motor vehicle following the car driven by the accused who claimed that they saw Mitchell wave towards the car driven by the accused did not make the institution of proceedings unreasonable. The learned Crown Prosecutor cited the decision of Manley (2000) 49 NSWLR 203, particularly, the observations of Wood CJ at CL, at 206, for which I will refer in my consideration of the matter.
	
	
	The Crown noted the case was “a circumstantial evidence case” or a case of “competing inferences” and it was a matter for the jury to determine assessing the witnesses and the credibility and reliability. It was submitted that because there were competing inferences, assertions of guilt or innocence to use the Crown’s word were properly matters within the province of the jury, citing the decision of Johnston to which I earlier referred.
	
	
	Consideration
	
	
	I turn now to the consideration of these issues that have been raised in the submissions to deal with what I have referred to from superior court authority as “the facts issue”. I make the following findings of fact. The accused was driving a motor vehicle in which his cousin Moussa Haddad was a passenger, they had driven from Western Sydney in the Guildford area to Surry Hills. Haddad at the time was in possession of a quantity of cocaine contained in 50 small plastic bags weighing a total of 24 grams.
	
	
	Haddad ultimately pleaded guilty to an offence relating to his possession and/or supply of that prohibited drug. The motor vehicle driven by the accused was a rental car rented by a relative of the accused but on a long-term rental basis.
	
	
	At the trial no issue was raised in the conduct of the case to the jury as to the circumstances of the accused’s possession of a rental car which might in other circumstances be of some significance. The accused’s car was an older unreliable vehicle as the evidence at the trial revealed.
	
	
	Police followed the vehicle driven by the accused in the Surry Hills area eventually to near the intersection of Albion Street and Bourke Street when the car turned left into Bourke Street. When the motor vehicle driven by the accused pulled over the accused at that point was still driving the car with Mr Haddad in the passenger seat. The police alighted from their motor vehicle and walked over to where the accused’s car was parked at that point across a driveway but parallel to the kerb.
	
	
	I find as a fact that Timothy Mitchell did not wave at the car driven by the accused. I also accept Mr Mitchell’s denial that he intended to purchase prohibited drugs from the accused. I say in passing for the purposes of that fact finding that Mr Mitchell was a very impressive witness. There was no evidence that Mr Mitchell knew Mr Haddad or that Mr Haddad knew Mr Mitchell.
	
	
	Mr Mitchell’s phone was confiscated and he was spoken to by police. He wiped his phone remotely on his return to his residence nearby to protect the provide and confidential information that he believed that the police were not entitled to have access to.
	
	
	Mr Mitchell was not charged with any offence. He gave a statement to the police in keeping with the evidence that he gave before the jury on 26 August 2016. Mr Haddad when he was approached by one of the police officers as he was sitting in the vehicle endeavoured to conceal an object between his legs. The accused did wind up the window of his car when it was approached by the other police person.
	
	
	When the two men, that is the applicant and his cousin were removed from the vehicle, police found 24 grams of cocaine packaged as I have earlier described on the passenger seat nearby or next to a mobile phone that clearly was identified in the evidence as belonging to Mr Haddad. There was no evidence available at trial of any type, either by observation of the police or by any scientific examination to link the accused physically with the prohibited drugs in the possession of Mr Haddad. The trial was not conducted as a case of joint possession.
	
	
	Whilst police were going about their enquiries Mr Haddad’s phone was very active with messages and calls being made to it. The accused’s mobile phone was taken into the custody of police and examined and no evidence was found on that phone of any information inculpatory of the accused in any aspect of drug trafficking.
	
	
	The applicant participated in an electronic interview in which he denied participation in drug trafficking, denied knowledge of the drugs in the car, denied that he was driving the car at the behest of Haddad for the purposes of drug distribution or was driving the car in any way to assist Haddad in the business of drug supply.
	
	
	He gave explanations for his possession of that particular car that was confirmed by police investigations and also gave reasons for being in Surry Hills at the time. The Crown did not allege nor was there evidence to support the accused at any time had the prohibited drug in his possession.
	
	
	The applicant/accused raised his good character in the sense that he had no prior convictions or charges. Mr Haddad pleaded guilty to his possession of the drugs found on the car seat, the character of the charge being, as I understand it, that of supply prohibited drugs in the quantity that was particularised in the indictment.
	
	
	So far as then considering the reasonableness of the institution of the proceedings I note by reference to the submissions made by the Crown that, in fact, the case was not one that turned upon solely the credibility of witnesses in the manner described by the Crown. Even if the jury preferred the evidence of the police and their observations of the conduct of Mitchell to the evidence of Mr Mitchell, as to whether he waved the car over, the Crown still had a very difficult problem of proving the other matters that I identified earlier as facts to be established from drawing inferences from the available circumstances of the case beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	Even putting the Crown case at its highest in proof of guilt in the context of the accused’s denials, the absence of any incriminating independent evidence to link him to the prohibited drugs, given the explanations he gave as to why he pulled his car over having regard to the fact of Haddad’s sole possession of the drug, even if it was accepted that the accused pulled over to the side of the car at Haddad’s direction, the Crown was left with what objectively can be seen to be an insurmountable hurdle unless the jury was to engage in speculation to fill gaps in the Crown’s case or to convict the accused by his association with his cousin.
	
	
	The Crown in its submissions drew my attention to the evidence which I excluded concerning the conversations had with Mr Mitchell. As I have earlier indicated I consider the reference to that material as material I should consider pursuant to s 3A of the Act notwithstanding the fact that it was not before the jury.
	
	
	This evidence from police officers or a particular police officer of alleged conversations with Mr Mitchell was said to be contrary to the statement he gave to the police and ultimately his evidence at trial. For the purposes of this application, as I said, I note that I regard Mr Mitchell as a witness of truth but that is certainly not the end of the evidence. His evidence on the crucial matters, absent the capacity to cross-examine him about this alleged conversation with the police, was not seriously challenged in cross-examination.
	
	
	Even allowing for the fact that I would not permit the Crown to put to the witness the claimed conversations had with the police in cross-examination, even if those matters had been put to Mr Mitchell, there could be no doubt in light of the other evidence that he gave that he would have denied that the representations claimed to have been made by him to police were, in fact, made.
	
	
	Those representations claimed by police which were not independently proven, not recorded in any way such as to establish the fact that they were made, were inconsistent with both the statement he gave to the police and the evidence he gave at the trial. Even if those representations made to police were accepted contradicting the evidence at trial, whilst it might have been a starting point for the Crown to link the movement of the car to the intentions of Mr Haddad, the Crown was still required to have the jury draw an inference beyond reasonable doubt that firstly the purpose of pulling the car over was for Mr Haddad to sell a drug on the basis that the accused, in fact, knew that within the car there were drugs in the possession of Mr Haddad in a case where the Crown did not allege that there was joint possession.
	
	
	To come back to the helpful submissions of the Crown, the Crown pointed to the “disparity” as it may be described between the evidence of the two police as to their observations of Mitchell and his movements and what Mitchell said himself about what he did and his intentions at that particular time. In the decision of Manley (2000) 49 NSWLR 203 it is important to note what Woods J said in the passage quoted by the Crown. The examination of the material “calls for an objective analysis of the whole of the relevant evidence”.
	
	
	His Honour said, as I have earlier noted in another context that:
	


“Matters of judgment concerning credibility, demeanour and the like are likely to fall on the other side of the line of unreasonableness being that is quintessentially within the realm of the ultimate fact finder whether it be judge or jury” (at 206).


	
	But the case did not turn upon, or if it did turn upon it only in part, the issue of judgment concerning “credibility” and “demeanour and the like” in potential conflict between the evidence of the observations of the police and Mr Mitchell.
	
	
	There were other issues for the Crown to establish that fell outside that particular conflict. As I said, they included knowledge of the drugs in the car and knowledge of the purpose that the accused understood was required for him to pull the car over to the side of the road.
	
	
	The Crown in paragraph 11 of its submissions points to the character of the Crown case its circumstantial nature. It correctly says:
	
	
	“The fact that the jury returned a verdict of not guilty does not mean that they accepted the innocence of the accused and the fact that the matter went to the jury meant that the conflicting assertions of guilt and innocence were probably matters within the province of the jury”.
	
	
	A criminal trial is not a question of the conflict between “guilt and innocence”. If I was to direct a jury as to the fact that it was determining between the guilt and innocence of an accused person and an accused person was found guilty in line with authority that goes back to the 1970’s there would be a new trial. What the jury was required to consider was whether on the totality of the evidence it could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.
	
	
	This case turned not upon, as the Crown submitted, “ultimately an examination of the evidence of witnesses as given at the trial”, instead it was a case upon, even accepting what facts could be established from the evidence, whether the Crown could successfully have a jury draw the relevant inferences that were required to be drawn beyond reasonable doubt. Getting part way there, that is for example, being satisfied that Mr Mitchell pulled over the case in the sense of signalling towards Mr Haddad, for example for the purposes of purchasing drugs, was only part of what was required to be established.
	
	
	With regard to that particular last set of submissions that I referred to, even accepting what the Crown put, the submission this is the point that even if the matter properly in the context of the trial process was left to a jury, there was still a need for the prosecution to undertake an objective analysis of that evidence in order to determine whether it was reasonable to prosecute the accused in circumstances where there were defects on the Crown case that ultimately and clearly by reference to the jury’s verdict and the speed by which it was achieved in one respect pointed to the fact that I should take into account that the jury returned a verdict of not guilty in “minutes”. To my mind ultimately it is not a matter of moment.
	
	
	Conclusion
	
	
	Thus in all the circumstances I have concluded and of the opinion that if the Prosecution had before the proceedings were instituted been in possession of all the relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings and that any act or omission of the defendant that contributed or might have contributed to the institutional continuation of the proceedings was reasonable in the circumstances.
	
	
	Just one last matter, I raised with the Crown whether in fact it was reasonable to institute the proceedings in the manner in which they were instituted. It does not form part of my reasoning in relation to this matter but it is worthwhile pointing out that I would have understood the reference in s 2 and 3 to the character of the proceedings and to use the words in s 3 “institution” of the proceedings was a reference to the proceedings that were conducted at the trial where the accused was acquitted thus giving rise to jurisdiction to grant a certificate under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act, that is by reference to the very charge that was brought against the accused.
	
	
	One of the issues in this trial as the Crown conducted its case was establishing that the accused took part in the supply of prohibited drugs in the sense that he was in effect providing assistance to Mr Haddad to sell drugs to Mr Mitchell. That is all well and good and I appreciate the particulars were that he knowingly took part in the supply of 24 grams which is the entire quantity of drugs in Mr Haddad’s possession. But that is not how the case was run and one might have thought if one analysed it that, if in fact it was the Crown’s case that the accused was knowingly taking part in one supply to one person of a portion of the drugs in Mr Haddad’s possession, it may well have been a matter that properly could have been prosecuted in the Local Court.
	
	
	Be that as it may, the facts of the matter are that it was before this Court and as I said the consideration of what the specific character of the proceedings were in light of the way in which the Crown conducted its case is not a matter that I will have used as determinative of whether the certificate should issue and thus I will issue a certificate.
	
	
	I will hand down a certificate to counsel for the accused. I hand down a certificate for learned counsel for the learned Director and I will place a certificate on the file.

The Court so provided the Reasons to the parties to enable them to consider the extent of the publication of the Reasons in view of the current criminal proceedings taking place relating to this proceeding.2    There is already in force non-publication orders made in connection with this proceeding, made by the Court on 3 October 2016.3    That order is as follows:(1)    Until further order, no person may publish any information which would tend to identify the individual respondents in connection with the proceedings or in connection with the allegations made in the proceedings.(2)    Until further order, no person may publish any information which would tend to identify the individual respondents in connection with:(a)    evidence of or in relation to a “ban against Boral”;  or (b)    evidence of or in relation to an instruction alleged to have been given by the CFMEU to shop stewards or organisers of the CFMEU to implement a “ban against Boral”;  or (c)    evidence of or in relation to shop stewards meetings held by the CFMEU at Trades Hall during February or March 2013.(3)    Orders 1 and 2 shall operate until the conclusion of the criminal proceedings or until 31 December 2018, whichever is the later in time.4    The Court on 27 October 2017 made the following orders to deal with the future conduct of the proceeding:  (1)    The Applicant is to file and serve on or before 4.00 pm on 1 December 2017:(a)    any affidavits upon which it wishes to rely; and(b)    its outline of written submissions. (2)    The First Respondent is to file and serve on or before 4.00 pm on 18 December 2017:(a)    any affidavits upon which it wishes to rely; and(b)    its outline of written submissions. (3)    The Applicant is to file and serve on or before 4.00 pm on 2 February 2018:(a)    any affidavits by way of reply to the affidavits in paragraph 2 above; and(b)    any outline of written submissions in reply.(4)    The matter be listed for a hearing at 10.15am commencing on 12 February 2018 on an estimate of 2 days.BACKGROUND5    The background and nature of this proceeding was summarised in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v The Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (2016) FCA 504, and is apparent from the Reasons themselves to the extent I propose to publish them.  I do not delay in repeating these matters.6    The individual respondents face criminal trials in relation to charges under s 87 of the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic).  Those charges arise out of the same substratum of facts and allegations as were before the Court in this proceeding.  Those facts and allegations are now the subject of findings made by the Court in its Reasons.7    Subject to the matters set out below, the committal of the criminal charges is listed to be heard in May 2018.  If the individual respondents are committed to stand trial, the jury trial would likely take place at some time in 2019.8    The individual respondents seek (and the CFMEU supports) that the Court delay publication of its Reasons, and to that end seek that non-publication and suppression orders be made in relation to the whole of the Reasons.9    If necessary, and at the appropriate stage, the individual respondents indicated that they will also make application that any declarations and other orders proposed to be made by the Court consequent upon its findings as set out in the Reasons also not be published until the conclusion of the criminal proceedings.10    In the alternative, the individual respondents seek (and CFMEU supports) more limited non-publication and suppression orders, which would have the effect of suppressing and preventing publication of identified prejudicial findings contained within the Reasons, and otherwise continuing in substance the non-publication order made by the Court on 3 October 2016.Evidence relied upon11    In support of the orders sought, the individual respondents rely upon the following material:(1)    affidavit of Marcus Clayton affirmed 4 April 2016, filed in support of CFMEU’s stay application; and(2)    affidavit of Kirstie Grigor affirmed 29 September 2016, filed in support of the application for the non-publication orders ultimately made by the Court on 3 October 2016.Current status of the criminal proceedings12    The nature of the charges, their elements, the particulars thereto and the Statement of Material Facts in the criminal brief are helpfully summarised in the reasons of Elliott J in the criminal stay proceedings, explained in more detail below: see [2017] VSC 422 at [7] – [12] and [18] – [23].13    As noted above, the committal of the criminal charges is currently listed to be heard in May 2018.  In related Supreme Court proceedings, the individual respondents in this proceeding (as plaintiffs in the Supreme Court) have alleged that they had not been validly charged, and have sought declaratory and other relief to effectively prevent the criminal proceedings from being prosecuted against the individual respondents, and restraining the Magistrates’ Court from hearing the committal proceedings currently on foot.14    On 14 August 2017, Elliott J made orders dismissing the criminal stay applications: [2017] VSC 422.  The individual respondents have sought leave to appeal from those orders.15    The criminal proceedings against the individual respondents have been listed for a special mention in the Magistrates’ Court on 5 December 2017 to consider whether the May 2018 committal hearing date can be preserved in light of the appeal from Elliot J’s decision.16    If the committals proceed as scheduled in May 2018, and the individual respondents are committed for trial, then it is likely that the jury trial would be held sometime in 2019.  However, should the committal not proceed until later in 2018, the jury trial may be deferred until 2020.consideration17    There is no doubt that there is a significant overlap in the evidence in this proceeding and the criminal proceedings, although the focus of each is distinct.  Significantly, the “ban again Boral” includes evidence which involves the individual respondents.18    Various findings have been made by the Court which are likely to impact upon the matters raised in the criminal proceedings: see [31], [39], [126]-[127], [129]-[134], [142], [150], [162], [165]-[166] of the Reasons as examples.19    The individual respondents say that:Without non-publication orders, there is a real risk that members of any jury empanelled in the criminal proceeding would learn of the findings in the Reasons, and that they would not be able to put those findings out of their minds, notwithstanding any direction given by the trial judge. This gives rise to a real doubt that any criminal trial would be fair. As was noted in ASIC v HLP Financial Planning (Aust) Pty Ltd (2007) 164 FCR 487 at [59] by Finkelstein J:[T]here is potential for an adverse impact on the jury. The civil case will be decided on evidence that, for the most part, will not be available to the prosecutor in the criminal trial. Imagine what would happen if a jury discovers that a civil court has ruled that Mr Berlowitz’ conduct is illegal. The judge presiding over the criminal trial will be obliged to tell the jury to leave that out of account. It is axiomatic in our courts that jurors can be trusted to leave out of their consideration things that they are instructed to leave out. Yet many regard this kind of instruction as little more than wishful thinking. Perhaps the jurors will have explained to them that the judge who made the ruling acted on evidence not before the jury and in any event a lower standard of proof was required in the civil court. Whether those instructions will result in a fair criminal trial may be strongly doubted.Notably, on the appeal in relation to the stay application, the members of the Full Court did not share the primary judge’s confidence that members of the jury would not learn of findings made in these s45D proceedings or, that if they did, the jurors would be able to put aside that knowledge either: (a) in compliance with judicial direction; or (b) because of a capacity to make a distinction between the different contraventions in the respective proceedings: see [2016] FCAFC 97 at [45].As to the latter point, it is significant that the applicable standard of proof in these proceedings against the first respondent is lower than will apply during any criminal trial. As a result, evidence which was admitted in these proceedings as against the first respondent (including evidence derived from the s.155 examinations), which is unlikely to be admitted in the criminal trial. This reality, obvious to lawyers and judges, may well be ‘lost’ on a jury asked to bring their minds to a consideration of substantially the same evidence against other parties pursuant to a different standard of proof.The more limited form of order made by the Court on 3 October 2016 was appropriate to the situation which attached at that time; namely the fact that evidence in support of allegations made in the ACCC’s pleadings was about to be adduced in a trial. Now, the situation is very different. What is now at issue is the prospect that findings of a judge of the Federal Court contained in the Court’s Reasons might be made public. Conclusions reached and findings pronounced by a judge will of course operate on the minds of jurors in a different manner from mere evidence adduced at trial by one party in support of the allegations upon which that party relies.The obvious risk of prejudice and an unfair criminal trial is obviated by the making of the non-publication and suppression orders sought by the respondents. While it is accepted that the primary objective of the administration of justice is to safeguard the public interest in open justice (s 37AE), in the circumstances of this case the Court has already acknowledged the risk of impact upon the fair trial of the second and third respondents. Unlike cases where the question which arises is whether there has already been irremediable prejudice to a fair trial such as to justify the delay or permanent stay of a criminal trial (eg Dupas v R (2010) 241 CLR 237), here what is sought is the taking of sensible prophylactic measures in order to avoid irremediable damage to the prospects of a fair trial. By dint of the sequence in which these events are unfolding, it lies in the power of this Court to take steps which are protective of the fairness of the criminal trials. The courts have confirmed the existence of a power to restrain publication of material likely to prejudice a fair trial.20    As an alternative, it was submitted that:Should the Court not be minded to make the non-publication order and suppression order set out above, the respondents seek, in the alternative, that the Court make the orders set out on pages three and four of the respondents’ proposed orders.The alternative orders proposed by the respondents comprise orders pursuant to section 37AG of the FCA Act comprise, in summary terms:(1)    a continuation (until the conclusion of the criminal proceedings or 31 December 2019, whichever is later) of the non-publication orders already made by the Court on 3 October 2016, and extend those orders in a manner which prevents the publication of any information tending to identify the individual respondents in connection with certain findings made by the Court;(2)    a further non-publication order in relation to certain findings made by the Court; and(3)    suppression orders in relation to parts of the Reasons.21    In response to these submissions, the ACCC opposed the extent of the suppression orders proposed, but does not oppose a more limited suppression order concerning the names of those alleged to have been involved in criminal conduct.22    The ACCC reminded the Court that, in deciding whether to make a suppression or non-publication order, the Court must take into account that a primary objective of the administration of justice is to safeguard the public interest in open justice: see s 37AE of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (‘the Federal Court Act’).23    Nevertheless, section 37AG(1) of the Federal Court Act provides:The Court may make a suppression order or non-publication order on one or more of the following grounds:(a)    the order is necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice;(b)    the order is necessary to prevent prejudice to the interests of the Commonwealth or a State or Territory in relation to national or international security;(c)    the order is necessary to protect the safety of any person;(d)    the order is necessary to avoid causing undue distress or embarrassment to a party to or witness in a criminal proceeding involving an offence of a sexual nature (including an act of indecency).24    A suppression order (or a non-publication order) will not be made lightly as the standard of proof is that it is “necessary” to make the order. 25    In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Air New Zealand Ltd (No 3) [2012] FCA 1430, Perram J considered the application of s 37AG(1)(a).  Justice Perram referred to Hogan v Australian Crime Commission (2010) 240 CLR 651 and observed that the High Court had emphasised that it must be “necessary” to make the order, which is a high standard that is different to “convenient, reasonable or sensible”.  Also, Perram J observed that orders of this kind were not concerned with trivialities. At [21], Perram J observed:… It is not a question, on the one hand, of seeking to serve, as best one can, the interests of open justice and, on the other hand, considering the prejudice which may occur if the information is released. The test to be applied is the posing of the question as to whether it is necessary to make the order to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice. No balancing exercise is required or permitted.26    The ACCC, in addition to submitting that the references to the CFMEU did not in itself lead to a conclusion about the individual respondents, made the following submissions:…(d)    Public interest and public debate about this decision is fundamental to the principle of open justice.(e)    Publicity of itself does not result in prejudice as the modern practices of criminal jury trials make it routine for trial judges to admonish the jury to decide the case only on the basis of the evidence and arguments led and advanced at trial. See R v Sean Lee King [2013] NSWSC 448, [55]-[60], per Bellew J. (f)    The common law assumes that jurors will understand and obey the instructions of trial judges to bring an impartial mind to bear on their verdict. See Gilbert v R (2000) 201 CLR 414, [13], per Gleeson CJ and Gummow J. (g)    Even if the Court’s reasons tended to identify [the individual respondents] in connection with the “ban against Boral”, and a potential juror became aware of this fact, this of itself would not necessarily mean [the individual respondents] would not get a fair trial. The possibility that a juror might acquire irrelevant and prejudicial information is inherent in a criminal trial. It does not of itself prejudice the administration of justice. The law acknowledges the existence of that possibility but proceeds on the footing that the jury, acting in conformity with the instructions given to them by the trial judge, will render a true verdict in accordance with the evidence. See R v Glennon (1992) 173 CLR 592 at 603, per Mason CJ and Toohey J.27    The ACCC then went on to submit that:If publication of the Court’s reasons will not result in an unfair trial of [the individual respondents] for the charges of blackmail, then the First Respondent has failed to establish that an order is necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice.Further, an important function of the Applicant as part of its compliance and enforcement strategy is to encourage compliance with the law by educating and informing consumers and businesses about their rights and responsibilities under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010. The non-publication or suppression orders sought by the First Respondent would prevent the Applicant from using the Court’s reasons in pursuing its compliance and enforcement strategy (which includes using the outcome of one court proceeding to encourage other industry participants in the sector to improve their practices) and that of itself would prejudice the proper administration of justice.28    Before continuing further, I repeat earlier observations I made about the role of jury directions and the making of findings and declarations.29    In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v The Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2016] FCA 504 I said:54    The respondents relied upon HLP and various comments of Finkelstein J therein.  However, it is important to put that decision and his Honour’s comments in context, remembering also the CFMEU in this civil proceeding is not standing in the shoes of an accused facing a criminal trial.55    In HLP the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (‘ASIC’) sought a declaration that the second defendant, Mr Berlowitz, operated an illegal unregistered managed investment scheme contrary to the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (‘Corporations Act’), and that he carried on a financial services business without the requisite licence. ASIC also sought an injunction permanently restraining Mr Berlowitz from operating a financial services business or from seeking funds from investors in connection with the operation of an unregistered managed investment scheme.56    Counsel for ASIC informed the Court that also under consideration was whether Mr Berlowitz should be charged with criminal offences in relation to the same conduct in respect of which proceedings had been brought. In addition, the evidence that ASIC intended to rely upon in the civil proceeding included statements made by Mr Berlowitz during coercive examinations conducted under provisions under the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth).  Those statements could not be tendered as evidence in the contemplated criminal proceeding. 57    In HLP Finkelstein J made the following observations at [58]-[59]:[58]    I would sum up the position as I see it as follows. The English and Australian authorities that warn of the dangers of a civil court becoming involved in criminal conduct continue to apply in an appropriate company case. The general rule in a company case is that a civil court will usually be the appropriate court to deal with a contravention of the Corporations Act. But the court should be wary of granting relief, including the grant of a declaration or an injunction, if the case is likely to end up before a criminal court. Ordinarily, a civil court should not intervene in those circumstances unless its failure to do so will result in irreparable injury. That strict rule need not be applied if the case involves undisputed facts and the issue raised gives rise to a question of pure law. Then a declaration can be a very useful remedy. As Barwick CJ said in Commonwealth v Sterling Nicholas Duty Free Pty Ltd (1972) 126 CLR 297 that is the kind of case “which contributes enormously to the utility of the jurisdiction.”[59]    The case at bar is a particularly good example of one in which the court should not interfere. First of all, a criminal prosecution is on the cards. Second, the facts are not agreed. On the contrary, if there is to be a trial, the Crown would be put to its proof on most issues and some of the “facts” to be asserted by the Crown are likely to be in contest. Third, there is potential for an adverse impact on the jury. The civil case will be decided on evidence that, for the most part, will not be available to the prosecutor in a criminal trial. Imagine what would happen if a jury discovers that a civil court has ruled that Mr Berlowitz’ conduct is illegal. The judge presiding over the criminal trial will be obliged to tell the jury to leave that out of account. It is axiomatic in our courts that jurors can be trusted to leave out of their consideration things that they are instructed to leave out. Yet many regard this kind of instruction as little more than wishful thinking. Perhaps the jurors will have explained to them that the judge who made the ruling acted on evidence not before the jury and that in any event a lower standard of proof was required in the civil court. Whether those instructions will result in a fair criminal trial may be strongly doubted. Last, but by no means least, is the falsification point made by Fryberg J which, if it occurs, will bring the law into disrepute.…61    In considering these submissions of the CFMEU, it is important to recall that the issue considered in HLP was whether the Court should make declarations against an individual respondent (Mr Berlowitz) that he had contravened s 601ED(5) of the Corporations Act as sought by ASIC, in circumstances where ASIC was still considering whether or not to seek to charge him with a criminal offence in respect of the same subject matter as the declarations sought by ASIC (at [15]–[17]).  This was the ‘real debate’ in the case before Finkelstein J.…66    The other matter to observe is that the Court in HLP dealt with the issue of the making of declarations of contraventions in the face of criminal prosecutions in respect of the same matter, rather than an application for a stay.  I will return to this aspect of HLP, but note now that Finkelstein J, having effectively determined the case, decided not to make the declarations as requested.  His Honour said (at [60]):For the foregoing reasons I decline to entertain, on a final basis, the application for declaratory and injunctive relief against Mr Berlowitz. I am, however, prepared to stand the matter over until a final decision is taken as regards a criminal prosecution. If Mr Berlowitz is to be charged I would dismiss this proceeding against him and leave it to the criminal court to decide his fate. On the other hand, if the decision is made not to lay charges, this case can be brought back on.67    I will return to the issue raised by Finkelstein J as to instructions to the jury and the jury’s ability to discard irrelevant material.  As Finkelstein J observed, it seems axiomatic that jurors can be trusted to leave out of their consideration things that they are instructed to leave out.  Whether this is ‘wishful thinking’ or not, I do not know.  Instructions to this effect in criminal trials are frequently given by judges.  However, I should proceed on the basis that these instructions are not given without good cause, and are given in the anticipation that they will be acted upon by the jurors.  Of course, there may be instances where an instruction to disregard irrelevant material will not be given, where the Court considers (for example, in well publicised cases) that any such instruction will have no real practical effect and so would be of no practical utility.…90    I then turn to the issue of the jury becoming aware of the allegations, the hearing itself, and of the eventual findings and orders of the Court in the civil proceeding.…96    If a trial judge in a civil proceeding could (by appropriate court processes) relieve against any unfair interference with the criminal trial, then this is a relevant matter to consider in any application for a stay.  In my view, any legitimate risk of prejudice to the criminal proceeding which arises from the risk of jurors learning about the evidence, finding or orders of the Court in this proceeding could be addressed in a number of ways, including through non-publication orders under s 37AF of the Federal Court Act.  This matter can more appropriately be considered at the point in time when the Court is considering making such orders.  It is true the High Court in Zhao said that closing the Court so that the Commissioner may progress the forfeiture proceedings and receive the evidence from the person also accused does not qualify as a proper reason for departing from the open court principle.  However, I do not consider the High Court intended by that comment to limit the discretion given to a trial judge, to be exercised in a wide variety of circumstances, to suppress particular evidence for relevant and proper reasons, having regard to the nature of the evidence sought to be suppressed, the identity of the witness giving that evidence, and possible prejudice to an accused in any imminent criminal trial.…101    I make this final observation.  The final hearing of the civil proceeding has not been commenced.  The form and content of the appropriate final relief (and the form and content of publication of reasons for judgment) in this civil proceeding is not presently able to be addressed nor resolved.  It may be that it is appropriate, depending on the circumstances, to delay the publication of reasons or declarations.  The result may be that the application of the ACCC is dismissed and no declarations would be made in that event.  30    The Full Court in Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2016] FCAFC 97 made the following observations:44    The applicants contended that the declarations the ACCC seeks in the s 45D proceeding would require the Court to make findings about [the individual respondents’] conduct, including their states of mind in relation to material facts relevant to the blackmail proceedings.  It was asserted that such findings may prejudice and effectively foreclose decisions and outcomes in the criminal proceedings.  What seems to be here raised is the prospect that the jury in the blackmail proceeding may be contaminated by the findings and declarations that may be made in the s 45D proceeding.45    The primary judge dealt with this issue at various points in his reasons including at [54]–[67], [90]–[96] and [101].  With respect to the primary judge, we hold reservations about his reasoning on this issue.  In particular, we do not share the primary judge’s confidence that members of the jury in the blackmail proceeding would not learn of findings made in the s 45D proceeding or that, if they did, they would be able to put aside that knowledge either in compliance with judicial direction or because of a capacity to make a distinction between the different contraventions alleged in the respective proceedings.46    As to jury contamination, we share the reservations expressed by Finkelstein J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v HLP Financial Planning (Aust) Pty Ltd (2007) 164 FCR 487 at [59], as follows:Third, there is potential for an adverse impact on the jury.  The civil case will be decided on evidence that, for the most part, will not be available to the prosecutor in a criminal trial.  Imagine what would happen if a jury discovers that a civil court has ruled that Mr Berlowitz’ conduct is illegal.  The judge presiding over the criminal trial will be obliged to tell the jury to leave that out of account.  It is axiomatic in our courts that jurors can be trusted to leave out of their consideration things that they are instructed to leave out.  Yet many regard this kind of instruction as little more than wishful thinking.  Perhaps the jurors will have explained to them that the judge who made the ruling acted on evidence not before the jury and that in any event a lower standard of proof was required in the civil court.  Whether those instructions will result in a fair criminal trial may be strongly doubted.47    However, it does not follow that an error is established sufficient to overturn a discretionary judgment or sufficient to warrant the grant of leave to appeal.48    On the issue of leave to appeal, we have arrived at that view including because the intervention of this Court at this juncture would be premature.  The possibility of jury contamination flowing from the making of findings and declarations in the s 45D proceeding may be entirely averted if the publication of reasons and the making of declarations post-date the hearing of the blackmail proceeding.  The primary judge at [101] specifically recognised that such a course may be appropriate.  The primary judge noted that the form and content of the appropriate final relief are not presently resolved and, depending on the circumstances, it may be appropriate that the Court determine to delay the publication of its reasons and any declarations it intends to make.  That all suggests that the primary judge intends to provide the applicants with a further opportunity to obtain relief from the prejudice which they apprehend.49    It follows that, at this juncture, there would be no substantial injustice if leave were refused.  We note, however, that delaying the delivery of reasons and the making of declarations until after the hearing of the committal or any subsequent trial may not suffice.  The spectre of successful appeal and retrial might require the delaying of findings until it is clear that a result has been finally reached.31    I should observe that the Full Court did not consider the decisions of the High Court in Gilbert v The Queen (2000) 201 CLR 414, R v Glennon (1992) 173 CLR 592 and Dupas v The Queen (2010) 241 CLR 237 (‘Dupas’).32    In Dupas, the Court made these observations: 26        There is an important point here.  It is often said that the experience and wisdom of the law is that, almost universally, jurors approach their tasks conscientiously.  The point was made as follows by Hughes J, with the endorsement of the English Court of Appeal, in R v Abu Hamza:“Extensive publicity and campaigns against potential defendants are by no means unknown in cases of notoriety.  Whilst the law of contempt operates to minimise it, it is not always avoidable, especially where intense public concern arises about a particular crime and a particular defendant before any charge is brought.  Jurors are in such cases capable of understanding that comment in the media might or might not be justified and that it is to find out whether it is that is one of their tasks.  They are capable of understanding that allegations which have been made may be true or may not be and that they, the jury, are to have the opportunity and responsibility of hearing all the evidence which commentators in the media have not and of deciding whether in fact the allegations are true or not.  They are not surprised to be warned not to take at face value what appears in the media, nor are they these days so deferential to politicians as to be incapable of understanding that they should make no assumptions about whether any statements made by such people are justified or not.  They are also capable of understanding and habitually apply the direction that they are given about the standard of proof.” In his reasons for dismissing the stay application, which are extracted in part and described above, Cummins J used similar terms with respect to the conduct of jury trials in Victoria. 27        Earlier, in Gammage v The Queen Windeyer J expressed the governing principle in terms which acknowledged that the jury room might not be a place of undeviating intellectual and logical rigour (a point made by Callinan J in Gilbert v The Queen) by saying:“A jury in a criminal case may sometimes, from compassion or prejudice or other ulterior motive, fail to perform their sworn duty to determine the case before them according to the evidence.  If they do so in favour of the prisoner, and not of the Crown, the law is powerless to correct their dereliction.  They must be assumed to have been faithful to their duty.  Their verdict must be accepted.” 28        Conclusions of this kind are not examples of the “ordinary” questions of fact which regularly arise for determination .  The assumed efficacy of the jury system of which Windeyer J spoke, whereby the law proceeds on the basis that the jury acts on the evidence and in accordance with the directions of the judge, represents the policy of the common law and is more akin to a species of “constitutional fact”, in the sense of that term explained by Heydon J in Thomas v Mowbray.  29        Whilst the criminal justice system assumes the efficacy of juries, that “does not involve the assumption that their decision making is unaffected by matters of possible prejudice.” In Glennon, Mason CJ and Toohey J recognised that “[t]he possibility that a juror might acquire irrelevant and prejudicial information is inherent in a criminal trial.”   What, however, is vital to the criminal justice system is the capacity of jurors, when properly directed by trial judges, to decide cases in accordance with the law, that is, by reference only to admissible evidence led in court and relevant submissions, uninfluenced by extraneous considerations.  That capacity is critical to ensuring that criminal proceedings are fair to an accused.33    In my view the observations of the Full Court relating to the views of Finkelstein J in HLP set out above should be read as per incuriam.34    However, the real issue here is that a judge of the Federal Court has now made specific findings which could come to the attention of a jury and would have a greater impact than evidence, trial submissions and media comment.  35    The totality of considerations that related to the stay application were different from the considerations relevant to the issue now before the Court.  The present position is the Court has the ability to prevent a jury from gaining information about the Court’s reasoning, findings and ultimate decision.  Assuming the overlap I have mentioned, and considering (as I do) that the reference to the CFMEU (even without a specific reference to the two individual respondents) will effectively be seen as involving a reference to these individual respondents, the proper course is to prevent any possible interference with the criminal trial.36    This is not to gainsay anything said by the High Court in Dupas, but to recognise it is better where a criminal trial is concerned to prevent possible prejudicial information being available to a jury.  37    I appreciate the criminal trial is some time away – but the Court’s findings are part of a permanent record and are not of the same character as media comment, the taking of evidence or submissions made at a trial.  38    I propose to make in substance the alternative orders as sought by the CFMEU, and make a new non-publication order substantially in the same terms as the one made on 3 October 2016, but to include the findings of the Court.  This will involve redacting from the published version of the Reasons the specific paragraphs as sought to be redacted by the individual respondents.  39    This will involve the delay in the ACCC’s concern in educating and informing the public of the need for compliance with the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) and enforcing its compliance programme, but these are lesser concerns than ensuring a fair criminal trial.  I am satisfied that the alternative proposed orders are required (and is all that is required) to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice.  40    The orders I propose to make by adopting in substance the alternative orders proposed by the individual respondents will enable a large proportion of the Court’s reasons to be made known.41    As to the further hearing, I propose to conduct that hearing in open court.  I propose to make non-publication orders similar to those made to cover the liability hearing.  I propose to so proceed for the similar reasons I proceeded to hear the liability hearing. conclusion42    I have endeavoured to write these reasons without reference to confidential aspects, but I provide these reasons on a confidential basis to the parties and their legal advisers to consider confidentiality issues herein.  They should also consider the orders that I propose to make with a view to whether any stay is required (and for what period) to enable any urgent application for leave to appeal (if any party is so advised).  I will accommodate any reasonable time so an orderly process can be undertaken to constitute an appropriate Court to hear any such application.  43    The orders I propose to make are (with the appropriate definitions as suggested by the proposed orders provided by the individual respondents):(1)    Pursuant to section 37AG of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), the Court makes the following non-publication orders on the ground that the orders are necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice.(a)    No person may publish any information which would tend to identify the individual respondents in connection with the proceedings or in connection with the allegations or findings made in the proceedings.(b)    No person may publish any information which would tend to identify the individual respondents in connection with:(i)    evidence of or findings made in relation to a “ban against Boral”; or(ii)    evidence of or findings made in relation to an instruction alleged to have been given by the CFMEU to shop stewards or organisers of the CFMEU to implement a “ban against Boral”; or(iii)    evidence of or findings made in relation to shop stewards’ meetings held by the CFMEU at Trades Hall during February or March 2013.(2)    No person may publish any information that relates to the proceedings and which is in relation to:(a)    findings made in relation to a “ban against Boral”; or(b)    findings made in relation to an instruction alleged to have been given by the CFMEU to shop stewards or organisers of the CFMEU to implement a “ban against Boral”; or(c)    findings made in relation to shop stewards’ meetings held by the CFMEU at Trades Hall during February or March 2013.(3)    Pursuant to section 37AG of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), the Court makes the following suppression orders on the ground that the orders are necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice:(a)    Any published version of the Court’s reasons will be redacted in the manner to omit non-publishable material; and(b)    No person may disclose by publication or otherwise the information in the redacted paragraphs of the Court’s reasons.(4)    Subject to further order, Orders 1, 2 and 3 shall operate until the conclusion of the criminal proceedings or until 31 December 2018, whichever is the later in time. I certify that the preceding forty-three (43) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Middleton.Associate:  Dated:    1 November 2017",2017-11-01 00:00:00,Federal Court of Australia
6455445,Bagshaw v Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions [2017] NSWCA 293,"Judgment


	
	WHITE JA: There is before me this morning a notice of motion filed by the applicant, Mr Leith Bagshaw in which he seeks the following relief:
	


“1.   For the return of my South Australian license [sic].

2.   Such other order as the Court deems fit.”


	
	The background to Mr Bagshaw’s filing that notice of motion is as follows. On 15 January 2015 it appears that Magistrate Connell in the Fairfield Local Court imposed sentence on Mr Bagshaw in relation to his convictions on various offences, including in relation to a charge of menacing driving. The magistrate ordered Mr Bagshaw to pay a fine of $1,000, disqualified him from driving for 12 months, and ordered him to enter a good behaviour bond for a period of three years. Mr Bagshaw appealed from that sentence and also purportedly appealed from convictions entered in his absence in the Local Court. In due course, his appeal against conviction was dismissed. An application for review of that decision was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 6 December 2016 (Bagshaw v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2016] NSWCA 340).
	
	
	On 30 May 2017 his Honour Judge Colefax heard Mr Bagshaw’s appeal against sentence. By the conclusion of submissions his Honour advised Mr Bagshaw, in substance, that if he persisted with his appeal against sentence, he faced the prospect of a more severe sentence being imposed. This warning was expressed in strong terms and Mr Bagshaw withdrew the severity appeal. On 30 May 2017 Colefax DCJ made orders that included the following:
	


“1.   Note: Parker warning given

2.   Order: Grant leave to the appellant to withdraw the appeal

3.   Order: Appeal dismissed

4.   Order: Convictions and penalties of the Local Court are confirmed

5.   Order: Disqualification period of 12 months is confirmed and is to date from today.

The offender, LEITH GORDON BAGSHAW is convicted and is directed to enter into a good behaviour bond for 3 years pursuant to Section 9(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to commence on 30 May 2017 and accept the following conditions: The offender must be of good behaviour and appear before the court during the bond term if required.

The offender, LEITH GORDON BAGSHAW, is ordered to pay the following:

Fine $1000.00.

The court disqualified the offender LEITH GORDON BAGSHAW from holding a driver's/rider's licence for 12 months.

Order: Disqualification period of 12 months is confirmed and is to date from today.”


	
	On 16 June 2017 Mr Bagshaw filed a summons invoking the supervisory jurisdiction of this Court and sought:
	


“1. A review of the decision of H.H.J. Colefax in dismissing my application.

2. Any other order this Honorable [sic] court deems fit.”


	
	The application for review is made pursuant to s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW). A hearing date for the summons seeking the review of the orders of Colefax DCJ has been set for 1 February 2018. Section 69C(2) and (4) of the Supreme Court Act provide relevantly:
	


“69C   Stay of execution of conviction, order or sentence pending review

…

(2)   The execution of the following is stayed when proceedings seeking judicial review are commenced:

(a)     a sentence imposed as a consequence of a conviction,

…

…

(4)     The stay of execution continues until the proceedings for judicial review are finally determined, subject to any order or direction of the Court.”


	
	Neither the respondent nor any other person has applied for any contrary order or direction that would prevent the stay of execution provided for by s 69C from operating.
	
	
	Mr Bagshaw has not, so far as I can see, filed any affidavit that sets out the facts giving rise to his notice of motion seeking return of the driver’s licence. He informed the registrar at a directions hearing in substance that the police had taken his licence from him. He informed me that, at the registrar’s suggestion, he had provided a copy of s 69C to the police, but they tore it up. It is not clear to me whether he has spoken to anyone responsible for keeping the records in the motor registry about the effect of s 69C in imposing a stay of the sentence confirmed by Colefax DCJ and reimposed by him. On 7 November 2017 the registrar wrote to the Chief Executive of Roads and Maritime Services (“the RMS”) advising that a summons was filed on 16 June 2017 to the Court of Appeal with respect to the orders of Colefax DCJ of 30 May 2017 and that the summons is listed for hearing on 1 February 2018. The registrar stated that:
	


“In light of Tay v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2014] NSWCA 267 [sic] Mr Bagshaw’s licence disqualification may be stayed as a result of s 69C of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW). You may wish to consider whether his traffic record ought to be updated as a consequence.”


	
	It does not appear that Mr Bagshaw has ascertained from the RMS whether, as a result of the registrar’s letter, his traffic record has been or will be updated pending the determination of his summons for review.
	
	
	In Tay v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2014] NSWCA 53 Mr Tay had instituted proceedings in the supervisory jurisdiction with respect to a judgment of the District Court in respect of his convictions for traffic offences. One of the consequences of the conviction was that his licence had been suspended and a period of disqualification imposed. Basten JA made a declaration that the effect of the proceedings having been commenced under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act in respect of the judgment of the District Court was to stay the operation of the order that Mr Tay was disqualified from holding a driver’s licence. As in this case, it appears that the only parties to the application at that time were the applicant and the Director of Public Prosecutions. His Honour said:
	


“[9]    Accordingly, it is appropriate to accept that the virtually identical provisions in s 69C, should be understood to have the same effect. The consequence is that upon Mr Tay commencing proceedings for judicial review of the District Court judgment, his licence suspension was automatically stayed. Because the statutory stay appears not to have found its way into the police records, with the result that he was stopped again for driving whilst disqualified in February of this year, it is appropriate that the Court make a declaration to the following effect; namely that, so far as his disqualification which formed the basis of the further offence on 28 February 2014 depended upon a judgment of the District Court made on 21 November 2013, which is the subject of the proceedings in this Court, the effect of s 69C is to stay the suspension of his driver licence. That will no doubt have consequences for the proceedings which are pending in the Local Court.

[10]    The only order I think I need make at the present stage is to declare that consequence. I do so conscious of the fact that a declaration is usually a final order, but it is nevertheless an interlocutory order in this case because it refers to the effect of a stay pending determination of the proceedings in this Court. The statute reflects the order which might otherwise be made by this Court: it does not dispose of the proceedings: cf Supreme Court Act, s 46(2)(b). No objection is taken to me (sitting alone) making an order in this form. Accordingly, I make the following declaration.”


	
	Mr Bagshaw asked that I make a declaration to similar effect in the present case. He also sought an order as sought in his notice of motion requiring the police to return his licence. Having regard to the course taken by Basten JA in Tay v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) I am content to make a declaration as to the effect of the filing of the summons seeking review under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act having regard to the operation of s 69C(2) and (4). However, if an order is to be sought against a police officer or the Commissioner of Police for the return of Mr Bagshaw’s licence, or if an order were to be sought requiring correction of the records of the RMS, then it would be necessary for the relevant police officer or the Commissioner of Police or the RMS to be joined as a respondent to Mr Bagshaw’s notice of motion in which any such relief against those persons would be sought.
	
	
	It may be that the making of a declaration to the effect of that made by Basten JA in Tay v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) will resolve the present issue. That is to say, it may well be that armed with the declaration no further relief will be needed and Mr Bagshaw’s licence will be returned. However, it may be that there are grounds on which Mr Bagshaw is presently disqualified, or his licence is suspended, which do not depend upon the orders of the Local Court and the orders of the District Court with which the current proceeding in this Court is concerned. As proposed by the Director of Public Prosecutions I will incorporate a rider in the declaration to be made so as to avoid the possibility of any misapprehension as to the scope of the declaration.
	
	
	The notice of motion will stand over for 21 days to the registrar’s list. If it is necessary for Mr Bagshaw to amend his notice of motion by joining further parties or by seeking any further relief, then he will have leave to amend his notice of motion accordingly and should file and serve the amended notice of motion within two weeks so it can be returned before the registrar in three weeks’ time, that is, on 4 December 2017. As Ms Kelly who appears for the Director of Public Prosecutions observes, there appears to be no affidavit served that addresses the facts which Mr Bagshaw would wish to establish in support of the relief. Any affidavit in support of the notice of motion should also be served within 14 days.
	
	
	For these reasons, I make the following declarations and orders:
	



	
	Declare that the effect of the proceedings commenced on 16 June 2017 in the New South Wales Court of Appeal under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW) in respect of the judgment and orders of the District Court given and made on 30 May 2017 is to stay the operation of the order of the District Court that the applicant, Leith Bagshaw, is disqualified from holding a driver licence for a period of 12 months dating from 30 May 2017.
	
	
	Declare that the effect of commencement of the proceedings referred to in declaration (1) stays the operation of the order disqualifying Mr Bagshaw from holding a driver licence until the proceedings for judicial review are finally determined by the Court of Appeal (subject to any order or direction of the Court), but does not affect any other order made by any court (other than the order of the District Court on 30 May 2017) providing for the disqualification of Mr Bagshaw from holding a driver licence.
	
	
	Stand over Mr Bagshaw’s notice of motion filed on 17 October 2017 to the registrar’s list on 4 December 2017.
	
	
	Grant leave to Mr Bagshaw to amend the said notice of motion as he may see fit.
	
	
	Order that any amended notice of motion that joins additional respondents to that notice of motion and any affidavit in support of the notice of motion be filed and served by 27 November 2017.

6455462,Murray v R [2017] NSWCCA 262,"Judgment


	
	WARD CJ in Eq: I agree with Price J.
	
	
	PRICE J: Matthew Scott Murray (“the applicant”) seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed upon him by McLennan SC DCJ (“the judge”) in the District Court at Parramatta on 3 November 2016. The applicant had pleaded guilty in the Local Court to two counts of supply of not less than the large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW).
	
	
	The prohibited drug in the first count was 4.96 kilograms of methylamphetamine and in the second count the prohibited drug was 8.66 kilograms of 3,4 methylenedioxy-methylamphetamine (“MDMA”).
	
	
	At the time of the commission of the offences, the large commercial quantity of each of the prohibited drugs was 500 grams. The maximum penalty for an offence of supplying not less than the large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug is life imprisonment and/or a fine of $550,000. A standard non-parole period of 15 years imprisonment has been prescribed.
	
	
	The judge imposed the following sentences:
	



	
	Count 1: 11 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 8 years commencing on 11 September 2015.
	
	
	Count 2: 13 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 9 years commencing 11 September 2016.
	



	
	As a result of partial accumulation by one year, the overall effective sentence of imprisonment is 14 years with a non-parole period of 10 years.
	


The Notice of Appeal


	
	The notice of appeal identifies five grounds:
	


“Ground 1: the sentencing judge erred:

(i) in failing to take into account the early pleas of guilty, or

(ii) in the alternative, in failing to explain in the reasons for judgment how such pleas had been taken into account.

Ground 2: the sentencing judge erred in that he:

(i) postulated a theoretical “street level purity” of the

methylamphetamine without any evidential basis;

(ii) failed to provide the parties with any opportunity to address his findings regarding the theoretical street level purity; and

(iii) placed undue weight on the purity of the drugs (particularly the methylamphetamine) in determining objective seriousness of the applicant’s offending.

Ground 3: His Honour erred in finding that the objective seriousness fell within the mid-range of objective seriousness.

Ground 4: His Honour failed to give proper regard to his finding of special circumstances in allowing for a ratio of 71.4 per cent between the total head sentence and the total non-parole period.

Ground 5: In the circumstances, the total sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.”

Factual background


	
	A lengthy statement of agreed facts was tendered which his Honour recounted in his remarks on sentence. A convenient outline of the agreed facts accepted by both the Crown and the applicant is as follows (AWS at [10.1]–[10.21]):
	


“[10.1] The applicant is the son of Peter Murray (“Peter”) and a friend of Tamer Kandemir (“Kandemir”), being the co-offenders.

[10.2] On 2 September 2015, Peter and another (unidentified) man attended Pack & Send in Liverpool, each carrying a medium-sized cardboard box.

[10.3] Pack & Send is a logistics company that deals in the packaging and freight of items, internationally and domestically.

[10.4] Peter provided his details, including his full name, mobile telephone number and email address to the employee of Pack & Send, James McMath (referred to in the sentencing judgement as James McMeagher), and informed him that one of the boxes contained a power drill and the other a saw.

[10.5] Peter advised that no warranty was required; however the boxes were to be sent to Western Australia overnight. When asked as to how the tools were packed, Peter replied ‘they’re in boxes and I have used rags around the boxes’. The cost to freight the boxes to Perth was $820, paid in cash.

[10.6] The receiver of the boxes (in Perth) was identified a ‘Dimmy Christinos’ (referred to as ‘Dimi Kritsonis’ in the Statement of Facts), with a mobile telephone (0435 XXX XXX), later identified to belong to [the applicant]. Peter informed Mr McMath that he would be in Perth on Friday and that the tools were for work that he was doing in Western Australia.

[10.7] Due to a concern that the power tools may not have been properly packed, and because warranty had not been purchased, Mr McMath opened the boxes.

[10.8] Mr McMath observed numerous pieces of clothing and a white unlabelled paint container with a handle inside the box. He pulled out the container and noticed that the lid was sealed with silicon. He could smell a glue or paint like smell. He shook the box and felt it had something soft inside the container. He opened the second box and observed numerous pieces of clothing with another white unlabelled paint container with a handle. He took photographs of the contents of the boxes and sent them to his manager.

[10.9] Mr McMath contacted Liverpool Police with concerns that the contents of the boxes were suspicious, and police arrived at about 2:30pm.

[10.10] Police retrieved the CCTV footage showing Peter, along with the consignment notes and details of Peter which had been provided to Pack & Send.

[10.11] Police seized both boxes and the drums located inside the boxes. Upon opening the first drum, police observed a yellow singlet with the writing ‘Pitbull Gym’ written on the front. Underneath the singlet, police located a number of resealable bags containing the prohibited drugs crystal methylamphetamine and MDMA tablets.

[10.12] When police inspected the second drum, additional bags containing crystal methylamphetamine and MDMA tablets were located.

[10.13] Police sent the yellow singlet for forensic examination, which revealed that the applicant’s DNA was located on it.

[10.14] The prohibited drugs were analysed and the total quantity of methylamphetamine (from both boxes) was found to be 4.96 kilograms. The total quantity of MDMA (from both boxes) was found to be 8.66 kilograms.

[10.15] Testing revealed that the purity level of one resealable bag of methylamphetamine (containing 996 grams) was 79 per cent. One resealable bag of the MDMA (containing 301 grams of MDMA) was tested to reveal 21.5 per cent purity.

[10.16] On 4 September 2015, police were granted warrants to intercept the mobile telephone numbers of Peter and the applicant. From that time until their arrest on 11 September 2015, the applicant and Peter were the subject of electronic and physical surveillance. An undercover police operative, posing as a Pack & Send employee, spoke with Peter during that time causing Peter and the applicant concern that the consignment had been lost or was mislaid.

[10.17] During phone calls between the applicant and Peter, the applicant expressed concern, stating

‘I don’t know what to do’,

‘I don’t know what I’m going to tell him’,

‘[the loss is] too much… shit that I can’t afford’,

I am finished man. That’s the end of the story… what am I going to do man? How am I going to pay this back?... What happens if they can’t find it?’

[10.18] On 11 September 2015, police arrested the applicant and Peter at the applicant’s address in Valda Street Blacktown. A search warrant was executed, during which various documents in both the applicant’s and Peter’s names were located, $3,600 was located in the applicant’s bedroom, Pack & Send documentation in the name of Peter was located in the applicant’s bedroom, a Blackberry mobile phone was located, an iPhone located on Peter and two black Nokia mobile phones were located in the applicant’s bedroom.

[10.19] Peter was taken to Blacktown Police Station where he participated in a record of interview, admitting that he attended the Pack & Send Store in Liverpool on 2 September 2015, but claimed that the contents of the boxes were 2 power saws, a power drill and a drill. He claimed that he was going to Perth at some point to undertake work and said that Dimi Kritsonis was an employee of his company who was going to do work on the Perth job. He claimed to have no idea that the boxes contained prohibited drugs, and said that he did not pack the boxes, instead suggesting that [the applicant] was responsible for packing the boxes. He told police that he had used Pack & Send in the past to send motorcycle parts and when asked about Tamer Kandemir, he said that he was a friend who lived in Perth.

[10.20] The applicant was also taken to Blacktown Police Station, and participated in a record of interview. He said he was not involved with the packaging of the boxes and did not know who had packaged them. He admitted that the drugs contained ‘some pills and some meth’ but said he did not know what the quantities were. When shown photographs of the quantities, and asked what he thought the value might be, he said ‘a million bucks or something’.

[10.21] The applicant told police that he was expecting to be paid $5,000 to move the drugs from Sydney to Perth, and he admitted that he had done this previously. He estimated that he had made between $30,000–$40,000 in total doing this. He described his role as ‘all I do is just make the call. See if it’s there and then that’s it. I just send someone to pick it up.’”

The applicant’s subjective circumstances


	
	The applicant did not give evidence during the sentence proceedings. Included in the written material tendered in his case was a report from Tim Watson-Munro, a psychologist, a letter from his grandfather, an affidavit from his mother and a letter from the Chaplain at Long Bay Correctional Centre. The Crown tendered a pre-sentence report and some statistics from the Judicial Information Research System.
	
	
	The applicant was born in May 1988 and at the time of the offences was 27 years old. His background is provided in the psychologist’s report. In summary, the applicant grew up in Blacktown, the only child of his parents who separated when he was about 6 years old. Although the applicant lived with his mother, he regularly saw his father. He described their relationship as being “very positive”.
	
	
	He left school towards the end of Year 10 to work as a carpenter’s apprentice. The applicant has subsequently been otherwise employed, being involved in installation work in warehouses since about 2013.
	
	
	The applicant told the psychologist that he commenced snorting cocaine at the age of 19 and would binge heavily on weekends. He has been binge drinking since the age of 15.
	
	
	Mr Watson-Munro observed that at the time of the offending, the applicant was suffering from an intense reliance upon cocaine which took the form of binging most weekends. He also described a protracted history of steroid abuse and alcohol abuse. The psychologist opined that this “speaks to underlying self-esteem issues”. The psychologist noted that the applicant expressed appropriate remorse for his behaviour, appreciated the gravity of the situation, and was keen to move forward with his life and return to the community in a more productive way.
	
	
	The applicant told Mr West, the author of the pre-sentence report, that he had debts of approximately $30,000 and it was the pressure to repay those debts that was the main motivating factor for his offending. Mr West noted that the applicant presented as very frank and open during the interview, had expressed regret and taken responsibility for the offences. The applicant’s risk of re-offending was assessed as relatively low.
	
	
	Anita Krieger, the applicant’s mother, states in her affidavit that her son is “genuinely a good person” who she knows will never re-offend. He has expressed that he is “extremely sorry” for not only changing his life but that of his whole family, by his offending.
	
	
	The applicant has no prior convictions.
	


Some findings by the judge


	
	The judge observed that there was no evidence of the monetary value of the drugs, although the agreed facts recorded the applicant’s own estimate as being “a million bucks or something”. His Honour noted that the syndicate had been on foot since probably the end of December 2013 and it was accepted that the applicant had been involved on some four to six prior occasions. As a consequence, the inference of good character that would otherwise be drawn from the absence of criminal convictions was not available nor could the applicant’s conduct be seen to be an isolated aberration.
	
	
	The judge said that the applicant was part of a trio which included his father “who was involved in an integral part of the distribution of prohibited drugs on the opposite side of the continent” (ROS 16). His Honour observed that without the activities of these three persons acting together, the link between the ultimate organiser and the final distributor would be broken.
	
	
	His Honour found that the applicant was “the go between for this trio as regards either the organiser or final distributor” (ROS 16).
	
	
	His Honour considered that the applicant was the person “clearly responsible for making contact with the person Whatsie that his role is more than the simple and discrete one of making a phone call” (ROS 17). An available inference, his Honour said, was that the applicant, as opposed to his father, or personal friend Tamar Kandemir, was personally responsible for the loss of the merchandise which was inconsistent with the very circumscribed role in the trio that he had advanced to police. His Honour found that the applicant’s role was integral to the success of the venture.
	
	
	The judge remarked that it was unlikely that the applicant’s role was as limited or that he was paid as little as he had said. However, the judge was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was the principal behind the operation or that he was to receive a share of the profits, whatever they may have been.
	
	
	His Honour found that the applicant engaged in the enterprise for financial benefit and had an important role in a group of three, who were integral to the success of this large commercial trans-Australian enterprise, which had been successfully on-foot for some time, was well-planned and organised.
	
	
	The applicant’s criminality was found by the judge to fall within the mid-range of objective seriousness. His Honour accepted the applicant’s expressions of remorse and assessed his prospects of rehabilitation “as being good” (ROS 20). His Honour was prepared to accept it was unlikely that the applicant would re-offend.
	
	
	The judge said that general deterrence was particularly significant and it was important to publicly denounce the applicant’s crimes.
	
	
	His Honour determined to partially accumulate the sentences as there were “different drugs with different weights and purities” (ROS 21). His Honour said that the partial accumulation of the sentences was reason enough for a finding of special circumstances.
	


Ground 1: the sentencing judge erred:

(i) in failing to take into account the early pleas of guilty, or

(ii) in the alternative, in failing to explain in the reasons for judgment how such pleas had been taken into account.

Argument


	
	The applicant contended that although the judge had acknowledged in the sentencing proceedings that he would be given the “full discount” for his pleas of guilty, there was neither reference to it in the sentencing remarks nor any evidence that the guilty pleas had been taken into account.
	
	
	Another submission was that if the Court found that his Honour had taken into account the pleas of guilty, his Honour had erred in failing to explain how they had been taken into account.
	
	
	Whilst the Crown accepted that there was no express reference in the sentencing remarks to a discount being applied for the guilty pleas, the Crown argued that error was not necessarily established. The Crown pointed to the express reference by the trial advocate that it would be appropriate for the judge to give the full discount of 25 per cent for the guilty pleas, his Honour’s remarks during the sentencing proceedings, the adherence of the applicant to his guilty pleas before the judge and the reference in the sentencing remarks to the guilty pleas. The Crown submitted that this was not a case whereby when considering the ultimate sentence imposed, the only available inference is that the discount was not applied.
	


Consideration


	
	The sentencing proceedings took place before the judge on 1 November 2016. Written submissions had been provided to his Honour by the applicant’s counsel which included a reference to the pleas of guilty being entered at an early stage in the Local Court and that a discount of 25 per cent should be allowed. During oral submissions, the judge said to the applicant’s counsel (Tcpt, 1 November 2016, p 20):
	


“And he will of course receive the full discount that’s available for his plea of guilty.”


	
	The Trial Advocate subsequently informed the judge that the Crown had no issue with the applicant receiving “the full discount of 25 per cent for his early plea” (Tcpt, 1 November 2016, p 25).
	
	
	At the conclusion of submissions, his Honour adjourned the matter for sentence on 3 November 2016.
	
	
	When the applicant was sentenced on that day, the sole reference to the guilty pleas in his Honour’s sentencing remarks was that the applicant had confirmed his pleas of guilty to both counts, which had been entered in the Local Court on 15 June 2016.
	
	
	The requirement for a sentencing judge to explicitly state that an offender’s plea of guilty has been taken into account was emphasised in R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383; [2000] NSWCCA 309 at [46] (“Thomson”). Although sentencing judges were encouraged to quantify the discount awarded for a plea, it was not mandatory for them to do so: Thomson at [160] (Spigelman CJ); R v Wendy Olive Lawrence [2005] NSWCCA 91 at [14] (Spigelman CJ) (“Lawrence”).
	
	
	In Lawrence, Spigelman CJ observed at [14]–[15] that although the guideline established in Thomson did not require sentencing judges to identify the discount, the rationale for providing a guideline included “the need to ensure that participants in the New South Wales criminal justice system had no reason to be sceptical about whether or not the benefits of a guilty plea were in fact made available to accused.”
	
	
	The importance of transparency when offenders are sentenced has been more recently emphasised in Woodward v R [2014] NSWCCA 205 (“Woodward”) and Lee, Matthew v R [2016] NSWCCA 146 (“Lee”).
	
	
	In Woodward, Hamill J (with whom Hoeben CJ at CL and Fullerton J agreed) said at [6]:
	


“[6]… There is no dispute that the plea of guilty was entered at the first available opportunity and that it entitled the applicant to a significant discount from his sentence to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea. In R v Thompson [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383; 115 A Crim R 104, a bench of five members of this Court emphatically determined that where an offender enters a plea of guilty the record should reflect clearly and transparently that the plea of guilty has been taken into account and the extent to which it has ameliorated the sentence imposed. Subsequent cases have made it clear that reference to the plea of guilty and a clear statement of the fact that it has resulted in a reduction in the sentence is usually an important part of a judgment, however brief, delivered in imposing a sentence upon an offender. It is possible to point to cases where a failure to do so has not resulted in interference by this Court, but such cases do not in any way diminish the force of the guideline judgment to which I have made reference. …”


	
	In Lee, Basten JA and McCallum J (with whom Davies J agreed) stated at [37]:
	


“[37] Because the plea is a mandatory consideration (s 22 says the court ‘must take [it] into account’), it must form part of the reasoning process and should therefore be addressed in the judgment. If the appellate court can be affirmatively satisfied that the plea was taken into account and an appropriate discount allowed, the failure to so state in the sentencing judgment may be treated as an immaterial error. Where there is a real possibility that it was not properly considered, failure to refer to the issue in the judgment should be treated as a material error.”


	
	There have been cases where this Court has been satisfied that the plea was taken into account and an appropriate discount allowed, although cursory reference was made to the plea and the discount was not quantified in the sentencing judgment.
	
	
	Amongst those cases are Lawrence and R v Reilly; R v Smith [2012] NSWCCA 166 (“Reilly and Smith”). In Lawrence, a ground of appeal that the sentencing judge had erred in failing to take into account the applicant's plea of guilty was dismissed. In his remarks on sentence, which appear to have been delivered ex tempore, the sentencing judge referred to the plea of guilty but did not explicitly refer to the fact that he had taken it into account, nor did he quantify the benefit of the plea. Spigelman CJ, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, concluded that in view of the sentencing judge's long experience and the structure and length of the sentence imposed, that he had not failed to take the plea into account and to give it appropriate weight. The final head sentence had been 27 months which could be arrived at by reducing the sentence of 3 years by a 25 per cent discount for the plea.
	
	
	In Reilly and Smith, a few moments before the applicant was sentenced, the sentencing judge told the parties that whilst he was having difficulty precisely calculating the discount for the early guilty plea, they had his assurance that the plea had been taken into account in the sentence. However, no mention was made of the discount in the ex tempore sentencing remarks. I rejected the notion (Basten JA and S G Campbell J agreeing) that the sentencing judge, having assured the parties that he had taken into account the pleas just prior to passing sentence would renege on his promise. I observed that the sentencing judge was very experienced.
	
	
	In the present case however, judgment was not delivered immediately following oral argument, but was reserved. The degree of latitude afforded to sentencing judgments delivered ex tempore is not available. Furthermore, the ungainly starting points of the sentences provide no indication as to whether the utilitarian discount was applied. Although his Honour had referred to the full discount in his discussions with the parties and made a passing reference to the pleas in his sentencing remarks, I am not satisfied that the pleas were taken into account and an appropriate discount applied. I mention that a consideration of the experience of the judge did not play any part in reaching this conclusion.
	
	
	I would uphold this ground of appeal. Specific error having been identified, the remaining grounds of appeal may be dealt with some brevity as it will be necessary to exercise the sentencing direction afresh.
	


Ground 2: the sentencing judge erred in that he:

(i) postulated a theoretical ‘street level purity’ of the methylamphetamine without any evidential basis;

(ii) failed to provide the parties with any opportunity to address his findings regarding the theoretical street level purity; and

(iii) placed undue weight on the purity of the drugs (particularly the methylamphetamine) in determining objective seriousness of the applicant’s offending.

Argument


	
	The applicant submitted that his Honour erred in that he:
	



	
	postulated a theoretical “street level purity” of the methylamphetamine without any evidential or other basis;
	
	
	failed to provide the parties with any opportunity to address in respect of his findings regarding the theoretical street level purity; and
	
	
	placed undue weight on the purity of the drugs (particularly the methylamphetamine) in determining objective seriousness.
	



	
	These errors, it was said, caused his Honour’s sentencing discretion to miscarry.
	
	
	The Crown argued that the judge’s remarks concerning the potential “street level” purity of the methylamphetamine were in the nature of an illustration of the significance of purity to the seriousness of the offending and were appropriate remarks in this context. Reference was made by the Crown to the discussions between the judge and the applicant’s counsel as to the very high purity of the “uncut” methylamphetamine. The Crown submitted that it was apparent during the sentencing proceedings that his Honour viewed the very high purity of the drugs as a significant consideration.
	


Consideration


	
	The focus of the applicant’s complaint is the following passage in the remarks on sentence (ROS 19–20):
	


“As a general proposition it may be accepted that the quantity of drugs involved in a particular case may not be the primary determinant of a sentence however its significance cannot be gainsaid in a case where the amounts represent large multiples of what is the statutorily significant quantity.

To further illustrate my point, it is well understood that drugs with a purity of almost 80 per cent can be diluted a number of times to what is referred to as a street level deal. In this case, the almost 5 kilograms of 79 per cent pure methylamphetamine could be diluted by a factor of four to produce approximately 20 kilograms of about 20 per cent purity. This is a common purity of this drug on the streets as far as sentencing courts are aware, and I note that the purity of the related drug in this case is 21.5 per cent. It is the common experience of these courts that street level deals occur in what is known in the trade as points, i.e., [0].1 of a gram. The potential 20 kilograms, or 20,000 grams in this case, represents potentially 200,000 street deals of 20 per cent pure methylamphetamine, the drug ice.”


	
	Although the judge spoke in terms of illustrating a point, the possible dilution of the methylamphetamine was a matter of significance.
	
	
	It is not uncommon for the Crown to lead evidence, whether oral or in a statement, from a police officer with relevant expertise as to the possible dilution of prohibited drugs with a high level of purity into “street deals”. This evidence is adduced to emphasise the potential value of the prohibited drug when it is “cut” into amounts which are commonly supplied on the street. However, in the present case there was simply no such evidence before the judge.
	
	
	In particular, there was no evidence that “almost 5 kilograms of 79 per cent pure methylamphetamine could be diluted by a factor of four to produce approximately 20 kilograms of about 20 per cent purity” (ROS 19). Moreover, the “common purity” of methylamphetamine “on the streets” had not been placed in evidence before the judge.
	
	
	Whilst the judge in oral argument had referred to the 4.96 kilograms of methylamphetamine, which was 79 per cent pure, as being “almost off the factory floor” (Tcpt, 1 November 2016, p 12), his Honour neither told the applicant’s counsel of his understanding as to how the drug could be diluted nor of his understanding of its common street purity. His Honour’s failure was procedurally unfair and his understanding was not based on evidence. As was said by Beech-Jones J (with whom Johnson and Fagan JJ agreed) in Munday v R [2017] NSWCCA 95 at [24]:
	


“[24]… if a sentencing judge proposes to rely on facts ascertained from a source external to the proceedings, then the parties should be so advised and given the opportunity to respond (R v JRB [2006] NSWCCA 371 at [42]; Farkas v R [2014] NSWCCA 141; 243 A Crim R 388 at [85] to [87]). Even if notice is given, it may still be erroneous to rely on such facts if evidence supporting them has not been adduced by the parties and proven in the proper manner.”


	
	For these reasons, I am satisfied that Ground 2 has been established. The question remains whether the judge placed undue weight on the purity of the drugs in determining the objective seriousness of the offences.
	


Ground 3: His Honour erred in finding that the objective seriousness fell within the mid-range of objective seriousness.

Argument


	
	The applicant complained that the judge’s finding that his offending “fell within the mid-range” of objective seriousness was affected by error as his Honour gave predominate consideration to the quantity of the prohibited drugs and their purity and failed to accord proper weight to his findings about the applicant’s role. The applicant submitted that the objective criminality was below the middle range, but not at the bottom or towards the bottom of the range.
	
	
	The Crown contended that given the factual circumstances of the offences, the judge’s assessment of objective seriousness could not be said to be erroneous.
	


Consideration


	
	The conclusion that the judge reached as to the objective seriousness of the offences was that the applicant’s criminality fell within the mid-range. His Honour made that assessment after carefully considering the amount and purity of the prohibited drugs and the applicant’s role in the offences.
	
	
	The judge observed that the applicant was “involved in supplying approximately ten times the large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine which was of 79 per cent purity and approximately 17 times the large commercial quantity of ecstasy, which was of 21.5 per cent purity” (ROS 1). His Honour’s careful analysis of the applicant’s role included findings that he had an important role in a group of three persons who were integral to the success of a large trans-Australian commercial enterprise for the distribution of prohibited drugs; that the applicant was the “go between” for this trio as regards either the organiser or final distributor; and that the applicant had engaged in the criminal enterprise for financial reward. His Honour was not satisfied that the applicant was “the principal behind this operation or that he was to receive a share of the profits” (ROS 19). All of these findings were open on the evidence.
	
	
	An important factor in assessing the objective seriousness of the offences is what the applicant did: R v Olbrich [2000] NSWCCA 389; (2000) 117 A Crim R 326. In the present case, the precise extent of his involvement in the criminal enterprise could not be determined on the agreed facts. However, the judge did not accept that the applicant’s role was as limited as he said. As the “go between”, the applicant played an important part in the distribution of the prohibited drugs.
	
	
	Other important factors in assessing objective seriousness are the quantity and purity of the drugs: Chong v R [2017] NSWCCA 185 at [21]. The purity of the methylamphetamine at 79 per cent was very high and the quantity of this prohibited drug exceeded the threshold of the large commercial quantity by approximately ten times. The purity of the MDMA was 21.5 per cent and the quantity of this prohibited drug exceeded the threshold of the large commercial quantity by approximately 17 times.
	
	
	In Koh v R [2013] NSWCCA 287, Johnson J observed at [108]:
	


“[108] There is no upper limit beyond the large commercial quantity. That category may be engaged where the quantity just exceeds the limit, or where the offence escalates to involve quantities confined only by the limits upon the capacity of a criminal syndicate to organise drugs for supply for potentially massive profits. The extent to which the quantity exceeds the threshold for the large commercial quantity is a very material consideration in assessing the objective seriousness of an offence: Paxton v R at 122 [131]–[132]; R v Calcutt [2012] NSWCCA 40; 221 A Crim R 505 at 507 [6], 522–523 [69].”


	
	I am not persuaded that the judge placed undue emphasis on the purity and quantity of the prohibited drugs. In my view, the characterisation of the objective seriousness of the applicant’s offending as falling within the mid-range was open to the judge. The applicant has not shown that the assessment of objective seriousness was outside the range properly available to his Honour: Ramos v R [2015] NSWCCA 313 at [41].
	
	
	I would reject this ground of appeal.
	


Ground 4: His Honour failed to give proper regard to his finding of special circumstances in allowing for a ratio of 71.4 per cent between the total head sentence and the total non-parole period.

Argument


	
	The applicant pointed out that without adjustment for special circumstances, 75 per cent of the head sentence resulted in a sentence of 10 years 6 months. The applicant submitted that the reduction of the non-parole period by 6 months did not give real effect to the judge’s finding of special circumstances.
	


Consideration


	
	His Honour considered that the partial accumulation of the sentences for count 1 and 2 warranted a finding of special circumstances and the effective non-parole period of the overall sentence was reduced by 6 months.
	
	
	After a finding of special circumstances, the size of an adjustment to the statutory ratio is essentially a matter within a judge’s discretion and will not usually be interfered with unless the non-parole period is found to be manifestly inadequate or manifestly excessive: R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264; Stoeski v R [2008] NSWCCA 230; Jiang v R [2010] NSWCCA 277.
	
	
	The judge found that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation and was unlikely to re-offend. After special circumstances were found, the overall effective parole period of the sentence was 4 years. In these circumstances, it is understandable that the adjustment to the non-parole period was modest. The applicant has not established that his Honour’s discretion miscarried.
	
	
	I would reject this ground of appeal.
	


Ground 5: In the circumstances, the total sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.


	
	It is unnecessary to decide this ground. As specific error has been identified, it is this Court’s duty to re-sentence, “unless in the separate and independent exercise of its discretion it concludes that no different sentence should be passed”: Kentwell v The Queen (2014) 252 CLR 601; [2014] HCA 37 at [35] (“Kentwell”). This Court is obliged to take into account “all relevant matters, including evidence of events that have occurred since the sentence hearing”: Kentwell at [43].
	


Additional material admitted on re-sentencing


	
	In an affidavit sworn 14 October 2017, the applicant states that he has obtained a full-time job as a sweeper at the Mid-North Coast Correctional Centre and has stayed out of trouble. The applicant says that since his incarceration, he has abstained from any use of illicit drugs and continues to enjoy the support of his mother and her parents.
	


Re-sentence


	
	The maximum penalty for counts 1 and 2 is life imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 15 years. These legislative guideposts are to be borne in mind when considering the appropriate sentences, having regard to the objective circumstances of each offence and the applicant’s subjective case.
	
	
	In the exercise of my sentencing discretion, I have formed a different view to the judge “about where, on an objective scale of offending” the applicant’s conduct stands: Carroll v The Queen (2009) 254 ALR 379; [2009] HCA 13 at [24]. I do not think that my approach is inconsistent with the rejection of Ground 3 where I considered that the applicant had not shown that his Honour’s assessment of objective seriousness was outside the properly available range.
	
	
	Whilst it cannot be doubted that the applicant’s role was important to the success of the criminal enterprise, the part that he played was limited to being the “go between” or facilitator of the distribution of the prohibited drugs from New South Wales to Western Australia. I would characterise the objective seriousness of the applicant’s offending as being below the mid-range, but not much below. In making this assessment, I have not overlooked the quantity and purity of the drugs which I have emphasised are important considerations.
	
	
	I find that each of the offences is equally serious. Although, the MDMA exceeded the threshold of the large commercial quantity by approximately 17 times and the methylamphetamine exceeded the same threshold by approximately ten times, the purity of the MDMA at 21.5 per cent was far less than the purity of the methylamphetamine at 79 per cent.
	
	
	A discount of 25 per cent for the applicant’s guilty pleas in the Local Court will be allowed on re-sentence. The guilty pleas are also relevant to the applicant’s remorse which was otherwise expressed in the material tendered before the judge. I accept that he has shown remorse for the offences as he has accepted responsibility for his actions, and acknowledges the harm caused by his participation in the supply of the prohibited drugs: s 21A(3)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I am also satisfied that he is unlikely to re-offend: s 21A(3)(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. All of these mitigating factors are to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentences.
	
	
	For the reasons given by the judge, the applicant cannot be sentenced on the basis that he was of prior good character.
	
	
	As the applicant is unlikely to re-offend, specific deterrence is a consideration of limited significance. However, I recognise the importance of general deterrence in sentencing for offences such as those of the applicant. This Court has emphasised on many occasions the high need for general deterrence in cases involving the supply of prohibited drugs: Jaafar v R [2017] NSWCCA 223; Scott v R [2010] NSWCCA 103.
	
	
	It must not be overlooked that the applicant played an important part in a large trans-Australian commercial enterprise for the distribution of prohibited drugs.
	
	
	My consideration of the structure of the sentences to be imposed has included fixing an appropriate sentence for each offence and the questions of cumulation or concurrence as well as totality: Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610; [1998] HCA 57.
	
	
	The appropriate undiscounted starting point of the sentences for counts 1 and 2 is 14 years imprisonment. After allowing for the 25 per cent discount for the guilty pleas, each head sentence is 10 years 6 months. There will be a partial accumulation of the sentences of one year. I agree with the judge that such partial accumulation warrants a finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	Accordingly, I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal allowed.
	
	
	The sentences imposed by McLennan SC DCJ for counts 1 and 2 are quashed.
	
	
	On count 1, the applicant is sentenced to 10 years 6 months imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 7 years, commencing on 11 September 2015 and expiring on 10 September 2022 with a balance of term of 3 years 6 months expiring on 10 March 2026.
	
	
	On count 2, the applicant is sentenced to 10 years 6 months imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 7 years commencing on 11 September 2016 and expiring on 10 September 2023, with a balance of term of 3 years 6 months expiring on 10 March 2027.
	
	
	The overall effective sentence is 11 years 6 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 8 years commencing on 11 September 2015 and expiring on 10 September 2023, with a balance of term of 3 years 6 months expiring on 10 March 2027.
	
	
	The earliest date that the applicant will be eligible to be released on parole is 10 September 2023.
	



	
	BEECH-JONES J: I agree with Price J.

6455464,Miles v R [2017] NSWCCA 266,"Judgment


	
	LEEMING JA: In this application for leave to appeal against sentence, the Crown properly conceded material error. The facts are set out in Rothman J’s judgment, which I have had the advantage of reading in draft, and to which I wish to add the following.
	
	
	The conceded error came about because the “Form 1” which had been drafted (it may be presumed) by the Crown, which was signed by a person authorised under s 32(5) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) and which listed five charges of supply and possession of prohibited drugs, failed to identify the “principal offence” in relation to which Mr Miles had indicated that he wished the court to take account when imposing sentence. Instead, it listed all five offences to which Mr Miles had pleaded guilty and for which he was to be sentenced. The error was not detected by senior counsel briefed for Mr Miles, nor by the advocate appearing for the Crown, as a consequence of which the sentencing judge did not receive the assistance to which he was entitled.
	
	
	A similarly defective Form 1 was the subject of comment in Woodward v R [2017] NSWCCA 44 at [23]-[24].
	
	
	The Form 1 offences included selling 28.19 grams of cocaine to a female undercover operative for $7,500 and giving her 0.64 grams of methylamphetamine as a sample in order (according to the agreed facts) that “she could assess how much of the drug she wished to purchase in the future”. The indictable quantity for cocaine is 5 grams.
	
	
	The Form 1 offences were plainly far from trivial. It was open to the primary judge to exercise the power in s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to impose an aggregate sentence, but it remained necessary to identify an offence as the principal offence, in respect of which the Form 1 offences would be taken into account, in the indicative sentence specified under s 53A(2)(b). This was one of the errors identified in Doumit v R [2011] NSWCCA 134.
	
	
	The Crown also maintained that it was wrong for the sentencing judge to state that “I have taken into account the five matters on the Form 1, which also has to be reflected in some accumulation of the sentences”. The Crown pointed to what a majority of this Court held in Sparos v R (2013) 235 A Crim R 462; [2013] NSWCCA 223 at [1] and [7]; cf at [59]-[60]. I agree that it was wrong to proceed on the basis that the Form 1 offences were required to affect the accumulation inherent in the aggregate sentence. In the absence of submissions on a point in an appeal where error is conceded, I do not think it is necessary to express a view on the point on which this Court divided in Sparos, namely, whether it was open to do so.
	
	
	However, and with respect, I struggle to understand how the accumulation to which the sentencing judge referred was effected. The primary judge imposed an aggregate sentence of 4.5 years, with a non-parole period of 2.5 years, on the applicant’s co-offender. The co-offender had been charged with no other offences, and yet the indicative sentences for the three offences – all of which were committed on the same day and in a transaction with the same operative – were 2 years and 3 months, 2 years and 12 months. It will be seen that the co-offender received relatively little reduction by way of concurrency. In contrast, the indicative sentences for the five offences for which the applicant was sentenced were 2.5 years, 3 years, 4 years, 3 years and 2 years. Those offences were committed over an 8 week period. It will be seen that the applicant obtained the benefit of a deal of concurrency, significantly more than did his co-offender, and both in absolute terms (6.5 years) and proportionately. I acknowledge that that might, at least in theory, be a consequence of considerations of totality, but if so, it is not explained in the reasons. Further, the reasons of the primary judge do not explain how such a different approach to accumulation – and one which was highly favourable to the applicant – was applied to both men, sentenced on the same day, when it was said that it was the applicant whose sentence was adversely affected by the Form 1 offences, while his co-offender had no other offences to which account was to be taken.
	
	
	I can deal with the other grounds concisely. I would reject ground 3, which asserts an error in the nature of double jeopardy in relation to counts 1 and 2. There is no such error. The three offences comprising the ongoing supply count which was count 1 took place on 3 days in July 2015. The supply comprising count 2 took place in August.
	
	
	The gravamen of ground 1 is addressed in resentencing. It is not possible to deal with it in respect of the sentence which was imposed, because all of the indicative sentences must be taken to have been infected by the error in relation to the defective Form 1. For that reason, there were only limited submissions on the test to be satisfied to establish disparity sufficient of itself to give rise to appealable error. That said, having now read what Hamill J wrote in Cameron v R [2017] NSWCCA 229 at [79]-[90], I think I was wrong, in Tan v R [2014] NSWCCA 96, to adhere to the proposition that it is necessary for the disparity to be “gross, marked or glaring”. In Cameron at [86], Hamill J said that:
	


“I am not convinced that the application of epithets such as ‘gross’ or ‘glaring’ to the asserted disparity is a necessary part of the process of reasoning when an intermediate appellant court is called upon to determine a ground of appeal where disparity (or, more usually, a lack of due proportion between sentences imposed on associated offenders) is asserted.”

I now share his Honour’s scepticism. Each of the three adjectives bears a different meaning: what might fairly be regarded as “marked” might fall short of being “gross” or “glaring”, yet the collocation of the three is apt to heighten the test and may distract from the underlying principle. The formulation “gross, marked or glaring” appears not to be found in appellate decisions in other States: see for example R v Phuong; R v Lewan [2015] SASCFC 70 at [39]-[51], R v McGuire [2017] QCA 250 at [46]-[47] and [100]-[101]; Hi v The Queen [2017] VSCA 315 at [71]-[72] and Barnden v State of Western Australia [2014] WASCA 161 at [55]-[59]. That said, there will always be differences in the objective and subjective elements in any case involving multiple offenders, such that mere difference in sentence alone cannot give rise to appellable error. The question is whether the sentence imposed on a co-offender is reasonably justified in light of those differences, bearing in mind the qualitative and discretionary judgments required of the sentencing judge.


	
	I agree with the sentence proposed by Rothman J, and with the reasons his Honour gives for that sentence. In particular, I agree that the sentence imposed on the applicant’s co-offender was at the very bottom of the range. Yet it was not said to be manifestly inadequate, and the applicant is entitled to the application of the principles of parity in respect of the sentence imposed upon his co-offender. The result is that the sentence which this Court will impose is one which is lower than it would otherwise be.
	
	
	ROTHMAN J: Benjamin Adam Miles (the Applicant) seeks leave to appeal and appeals the sentence imposed upon him in the District Court on 10 June 2016. After a 25% discount for a plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity and consequent upon a finding of special circumstances, the sentencing judge imposed an aggregate sentence of 8 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months.
	
	
	A Form 1 was lodged which indicated that further offences listed therein should be taken into account in relation to each of the offences for which the Applicant was to be sentenced. It is correctly conceded by the Crown, in this proceeding, that such a course was an error of law and the Form 1 was required to relate to one only offence.
	
	
	His Honour sentenced on the basis of the Form 1 as filed and, thereby, was led into error. As a consequence, error is disclosed and the Court is required to re-sentence. I will expand on the foregoing.
	


Offences


	
	The Applicant was charged with five offences being:
	


Count 1:    Ongoing Supply of prohibited drug, contrary to s 25A(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (“the Drug Act”), for which the maximum sentence is 20 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $385,000 and for which there is no standard non-parole period;

Count 2:   Supply prohibited drug (large commercial quantity) (3, 4 MDMA), contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Act, for which the maximum sentence is life imprisonment and/or a fine of $550,000 and for which the legislature has set a standard non-parole period of 15 years imprisonment.

Count 3:    Supply prohibited drug (large commercial quantity) (3, 4 MDMA), contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Act, and for which the maximum sentence and standard non-parole period are set out in count 2 above.

Count 4:   Supply prohibited drug (commercial quantity) (Cocaine), contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Act, for which the legislature has set a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $385,000 and a standard non-parole period of 10 years imprisonment.

Count 5:   Supply prohibited drug (methylamphetamine), contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Act, for which the maximum sentence is 15 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $220,000 and for which there is no standard non-parole period.


	
	In the course of the application for leave and appeal, the Applicant and the Respondent (Crown) jointly sought to amend the Form 1 so that it applied only to count 3 above, being sequence 11 in the records relating to the sentencing proceedings.
	
	
	The Applicant’s proceedings on sentence were conducted at the same time as the proceedings of his co-offender, who was charged with three offences being the offences referred to above of counts 3, 4 and 5.
	
	
	Given the centrality of the parity issue in these proceedings, it is appropriate to set out the indicative sentences for the Applicant and his co-offender, which are as follows:
	



	
		
			
			INDICATIVE SENTENCES
			
			
			The Applicant, Miles
			
			
			The Co-Offender, Abraham
			
		
		
			
			Count 1 Miles

Facts


	
	There were agreed facts upon which basis the Applicant was sentenced, which were in the following terms:
	


“The accused is a single male with no dependants. At the time of charging he was 25 years, unemployed, and had no form of income other than welfare benefits.

In June 2015 the Monaro Drug Unit formed Strike Force Hiems to investigate the supply of prohibited drugs in Jindabyne and the NSW snow fields during the 2015 snow season.

On 23 June 2015 Assistant Commissioner WORBOYS authorised the conduct of the cross-border controlled operation authority referenced CBCO15/189 in relation to the supply of prohibited drugs involving the accused, Benjamin Adam Miles.

Sequence four: S25A(1) DMTA Ongoing supply (incorporating Seq 1, 2, 3)

Between 2 July 2015 and 29 July 2015, a period of not more than 30 consecutive days, the accused supplied a prohibited drug, namely 3,4- methyl enedioxymethylamphetamine, on three occasions for financial reward.

Supply one (seq 1):

About 3:28pm 2 July 2015 the accused, Benjamin Miles, was recorded at the Lake Jindabyne Hotel, Kosciuszko Road, Jindabyne while he negotiated the sale of 3,4-methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (hereinafter referred to as MDMA) to a female known to police in exchange for $2990. In conversations with the accused he was recorded saying that he had a large customer base and encouraged the female to purchase larger quantities of the drug. The accused stated he was capable of supplying multiple ounce weights for $4,800 each. The accused further stated that the female should put the drug in gel caps to sell them to maximise her profit.

In further conversations with the accused he was recorded saying he did not want the money and drugs in the one place so the female gave him $2,990 and he left the keys to his 2007 Subaru Forester with the female as collateral. The accused walked to unit 10 Gippsland Street, Jindabyne, with the money and returned a short time later and was recorded while he supplied the female with 13.70grams of MDMA.

The substance supplied by the accused was analysed by the NSW Forensic & Analytical Science Service and found to be 3,4-methyIenedioxymethylamphetamine with a purity of 67.0%. The indictable quantity is 1.25grams. The commercial quantity is 125grams. The large commercial quantity is 500grams.

Supply two (seq 2):

About 4:29pm, 23 July 2015 the accused was recorded at the Lake Jindabyne Hotel, Kosciuszko Road, Jindabyne while he supplied 51.72grams of MDMA to a female known to police in exchange for $9,000. The accused stated that he was a sponsored snowboarder who picked up work occasionally as a labourer or dish washer and that he travelled internationally with regularity.

The substance supplied by the accused was analysed by the NSW Forensic & Analytical Science Service and found to be 3,4-methylenedioxymethylamphetamine with a purity of 72.0%. The indictable quantity is 1.25grams. The commercial quantity is 125grams. The large commercial quantity is 500grams.

Supply three (seq 3):

About 3:06pm, 29 July 2015 the accused was recorded at the Jindabyne Bowling Club, Bay Street, Jindabyne while meeting a female known to police. At 3:47pm, the same day in Park Road, Jindabyne the accused was recorded while he supplied 56.80grams of MDMA to the female in exchange for $9,000.

During the meeting the accused encouraged the female to purchase larger quantities of drug and quoted $4,300 per ounce if she purchased more than four ounces at a time. The accused reassured the female that he would still be making money on the deal. The accused explained that he would like for the female to refer to the drug as ‘cheeseburgers’ when she rang to place an order. He further explained that one cheeseburger would be an ounce (28.4grams) of MDMA.

The substance supplied by the accused was analysed by the NSW Forensic & Analytical Science Service and found to be 3,4- methylenedioxymethylamphetamine. The indictable quantity is 1,25grams. The commercial quantity is 125grams. The large commercial quantity is 500grams.

Sequence ten: S25(2) supply large commercial quantity prohibited drug (incorporating Seq 5, 6, 9)

Between 2 July 2015 and 20 August 2015 the accused supplied the female with a total of 646.86grams of 3,4- methylenedioxymethylamphetarnine. It should be noted that theaccused, at every meeting with the female, encouraged her to purchase more of the drug for on supply. The accused consistently offered price reductions as an incentive for the female to make larger purchases.

The purity of the MDMA sold by the accused to this point was of very high potency and as such would pose a significantly higher risk of injury to the end user if not diluted or taken in minute quantities. The amount of drug supplied by the accused has the potential to make 40,000 street deals of the drug.

Sequence five

About 2:08pm, 5 August 2015 the accused was recorded while he met a female known to police at the Jindabyne Bowling Club, Kosciuszko Road, Jindabyne and negotiated the purchase of MDMA. During this conversation the accused reiterated that he was making money on the transaction and that he travelled to Canada and the United States for their snow seasons, planning to return there again in January. The accused was recorded while he encouraged the female to purchase larger quantities of MDMA and quoted her $4,000 per ounce when she purchased in quantities of greater than ten ounces (284 grams).

About 2:36pm the female handed the accused $17,200 for an agreed four ounces of MDMA. The accused gave the female his car keys and directed her to go to the car park of the Lake Jindabyne Hotel. The accused was observed to enter 1/10 Gippsland Street, Jindabyne for a short period before walking to the car park of the car park of the Lake Jindabyne Hotel, Kosciuszko Road, Jindabyne. The accused was recorded while he supplied 111.38grams of MDMA to the female.

The substance supplied by the accused was analysed by the NSW Forensic & Analytical Science Service and confirmed to be 3,4- methylenedioxymethylamphetamine. The indictable quantity is 1.25grams. The commercial quantity is 125grams. The large commercial quantity is 500grams.

Sequence six

About 3:18pm, 12 August 2015 the accused was recorded while he met a female known to police at the Jindabyne Bowling Club, Kosciuszko Road, Jindabyne and negotiated the purchase of MDMA. The accused told the female that, aside from MDMA, he could source cocaine and methylamphetamine (‘ice’). The accused quoted the female $7,500 per ounce of cocaine and stated that it was of high quality. The accused asked the female to refer to the cocaine as ‘drinks’ when ordering the drug over the phone and that one drink would be an ounce of cocaine. He asked the female to refer to the methylamphetamine as ‘fries’ and again one fries would be an ounce. He joked that if you want all three it would be a ‘meal deal’.

The accused asked that the female order the MDMA in half pound (227gram) amounts where she could, as it would save repackaging of the drug. The accused told the female if she was purchasing the MDMA in quantities greater than half pound then he would charge her $3,800 but reassured her that he was still making money on the deal.

About 4:07pm, the female handed the accused $19,350 for an agreed four and a half ounces of MDMA. The accused gave the female his car keys and directed her to go to on-street parking in Park Road, Jindabyne. The accused was observed to walk to and enter 1/10 Gippsland Street, Jindabyne for a short period before walking to where the female had parked as directed. The accused was recorded while he supplied 125.80grams of MDMA to the female.

The substance supplied by the accused was analysed by the NSW Forensic & Analytical Science Service and found to be 3,4- methyl enedioxymethylamphetamine with a purity of 78%. The indictable quantity is 1.25grams. The commercial quantity is 125grams. The large commercial quantity is 500grams.

Sequence nine

Also during this meeting the accused was recorded while he supplied the female with ten ounces (278.64grams) of MDMA in exchange for $38,000.

The substance supplied by the accused was analysed by the NSW Forensic & Analytical Science Service and found to be 3,4- methylenedioxymethylamphetamine with a purity of 65%. The indictable quantity is 1.25grams. The commercial quantity is 125grams. The large commercial quantity is 500grams.

Sequence seven: S25m DMTA (Form 1)

About 3:30pm, 20 August 2015 the accused was at the Bullocks Flat Ski Tube Station car park, Alpine Way, Jindabyne when he was recorded while he supplied 28.19grams of cocaine to a female known to police in exchange for $7,500. The accused told the female that if she purchased the cocaine in pound quantities (454grams) he would be able to bring the price down to $7,300 yet still make money.

The substance supplied by the accused was analysed by the NSW Forensic & Analytical Science Service and found to be cocaine with a purity of 28.5%. The indictable quantity is 5grams. The commercial quantity is 250grams. The large commercial quantity is 1000grams.

Sequence eight: S25(l) DMTA (Form 1)

Also during this meeting the accused supplied the female with 0.64grams of methylamphetamine (‘ice’) as a sample at no cost so she could assess how much of the drug she wished to purchase in future. The accused told the female that he did not do much of the methylamphetamine and would source only a couple of ounces (56.8grams) with a purity of 81%.

The substance supplied by the accused was analysed by the NSW Forensic & Analytical Science Service and found to be methylamphetamine.

Sequence eleven: S25(2) DMTA: Supply large commercial quantity prohibited drug

About 2.00pm, 27 August 2015 the accused was at the Bullocks Flat Ski Tube Station car park, Alpine Way, Jindabyne when he was recorded while he supplied 681.6grams of 3,4-methylenedioxymethylamphetamine to a female known to police in exchange for $91,200. The commercial quantity is 125grams. The large commercial quantity is 500grams.

Sequence twelve: S25(2) DMTA: Supply commercial quantity prohibited drug About 2.00pm, 27 August 2015 the accused was at the Bullocks Flat Ski Tube Station car park, Alpine Way, Jindabyne when he was recorded while he supplied 284.0grams of cocaine to a female known to police in exchange for $75,000. The indictable quantity is 5grams. The commercial quantity is 250grams. The large commercial quantity is 1000grams.

Sequence thirteen: S25(1)DMTA: Supply prohibited drug

About 2.00pm, 27 August 2015 the accused was at the Bullocks Flat Ski Tube Station car park, Alpine Way, Jindabyne when he was recorded while he supplied 56.8grams of methylamphetamine to a female known to police in exchange for $23,800. The indictable quantity is 1.25grams. The commercial quantity is 125grams. The large commercial quantity is 500grams.

Arrest

About 2.06pm, 27 August 2015 the accused was arrested at the Bullocks Flat Ski Tube Station car park, Alpine Way, Jindabyne. The accused was cautioned and all safeguards adhered to.

Sequence fifteen- S10(l) DMTA Possess prohibited drug (Form 1)

During the search of the accused investigators located in the top breast pocket of his shirt a clear plastic vial with a black screw-on lid containing a white powder. The accused stated the contents of the vial was cocaine.

The accused was informed of investigators intent to execute a search warrant on his residence at 2/10 Gippsland Street, Jindabyne. At that time the accused stated a wooden chest and its contents located in the living room of that unit was his.

A short time later the accused was conveyed to 2/10 Gippsland Street, Jindabyne. The accused was introduced onto the video recording and was asked to nominate his bedroom which he did. The accused also nominated the wooden chest.

Sequence sixteen: SlO(l) DMTA Possess prohibited drug (Form 1)

Located within the wooden chest was a small plastic re-sealable bag containing a white powder. The accused stated the powder was MDMA powder.

Sequence seventeen: S10(l) DMTA Possess prohibited drug (Form 1)

Also located within the wooden chest were a total of 77 oxycontin tablets. The accused stated the tablets were oxycontin tablets and he did not possess a prescription for them.

Also located within the wooden chest was $120 in Australian currency, a number of re-sealable plastic bags, a large re-sealable bag containing empty clear gell caps and two sets of digital scales.

The accused was taken to Cooma Police Station where he was introduced to the custody manager. The accused was explained his rights under Part 9. The accused participated in an electronically recorded interview and was informed of the allegations and declined to answer any questions put to him.

Electronic and physical surveillance was used extensively during operations and forms a significant portion of brief of evidence. Listening device recordings made during operations were done so under section 7(4) of the Surveillance Devices Act 2007 (NSW). Telephone intercept and surveillance warrants authorised other covertly obtained evidence by the Strike Force.

3,4- methylenedioxymethylamphetamine, cocaine, methylamphetamine and oxycodone are prohibited drugs listed on Schedule One of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW).

On conviction, a Drug Proceeds Order is sought under section 29 Confiscation of Proceeds of Crime Act 1989 (NSW) for the sum of $103,040, being the total amount of money from which the accused received benefit as a result of supply prohibited drugs to known persons during this operation.

On conviction an Order is sought for the destruction of prohibited drugs retained by the New South Wales Police in relation to this matter.”


	
	Material was adduced on behalf of the Applicant going to his subjective circumstances. The Applicant gave evidence on sentence and was cross-examined by the Crown.
	
	
	In addition to the oral testimony of the Applicant, the Court had before it a pre-sentence report of 16 February 2016 and a record disclosing that the Applicant was a first offender (as was his co-offender).
	
	
	The Applicant tendered a letter over his own signature (Exhibit 1 in the sentence proceedings) and a statement by his mother, which included a reference from his school; a record of his having obtained a Bachelor of Industrial Design from University; a letter from a potential employer; material going to his snowboarding expertise and registration of a business name relating to that.
	
	
	Further, a psychiatric report from Professor James Ogloff AM, Clinical and Forensic Psychologist, was tendered (Exhibit 3 in the sentence proceedings). Professor Ogloff also compiled a report in relation to the co-offender that was tendered in the proceedings in relation to the co-offender’s sentence.
	
	
	It is unnecessary to recite large extracts from the report of Professor Ogloff in relation to the Applicant, but it is clear that the Applicant exhibited “low mood” and “was particularly anxious during the assessment”. His expressed emotion was blunted and he displayed low-concept and was largely dependent on the perception that others have of him (Exhibit 3 [44]).
	
	
	Apart from the presentation of very low self-esteem to which Professor Ogloff referred, the Professor also referred to the Applicant’s feelings of inadequacy and shame, the latter being particularly about his offending and the effect it has had on his family. Part of the feelings of inadequacy was the Applicant’s perception of the comparison between him and his older brother.
	
	
	Despite a history of serious clinical depression in the Applicant’s family and the Applicant’s reluctance to discuss this history (particularly his mother’s and uncle’s experiences with depression), the Applicant did not have a formal history of depressive illness or anxiety sufficient to enable Professor Ogloff to diagnose a pre-existing depressive illness. This is because, notwithstanding treatment by counselling and medication, the Professor found it “difficult to determine to what extent his depressed mood and anxiety have persisted over time or are the result of his negative life circumstances including his poor adjustment to incarceration”.
	
	
	The report suggests that the diagnosis “that most closely captures his presentation is Adjustment Disorder, with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, persistent (symptoms lasting greater than 6 months)”. The Professor however was unable to determine definitively the prognosis of his disorder without a good understanding of his mental health history and outcome.
	
	
	The Applicant’s co-offender, on the other hand, gave a more complete psychological history to Professor Ogloff, which included a prior report of a clinical psychologist (15 February 2016, i.e. after incarceration for the offences) from which the Professor could conclude that the co-offender met the criteria for Dysthymia, co-morbid with cannabis addiction. Dysthymia is now (DSM-5) known as Persistent Depressive Disorder.
	
	
	It is necessary to recite that the Applicant was arrested and charged on 27 August 2015 and bail was refused. The Applicant has remained in custody since that date. The Applicant entered a plea of guilty at the Local Court on 10 December 2015 (the earliest reasonable opportunity); and the sentence hearing and sentencing occurred on 25 May 2016 and 10 June 2016.
	


Grounds of Appeal


	
	The Applicant raises three grounds of appeal:
	


“1.    Ground 1:

The Applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance as to the disparity in the sentence imposed upon him for the three offences committed jointly with his co-offender and that disparity is such as to justify the intervention of this Honourable Court.

2.    Ground 2:

His Honour erred in his process of taking into account the outstanding charges admitted by the Applicant.

3.    Ground 3:

The indicative sentences that his Honour imposed for counts 1 and 2 are infected with an error in the nature of double jeopardy, and as a result the aggregate sentence imposed for all counts including these two is similarly so infected.”


	
	As stated at the outset, the Crown concedes that the matter raised in Ground 2 was an error of law that fulfils the standard expressed by the High Court in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499; [1936] HCA 40, but does not concede Grounds 1 or 3. Given the concession as to Ground 2, it is necessary for the Court, as presently constituted, to re-sentence. Part of that re-sentencing function involves a consideration of whether a lesser sentence is warranted in law.
	
	
	Because other error has already been conceded, it is technically unnecessary to deal with disparity in the sentence appeal. Nevertheless, it is necessary to deal with the appropriate parity between the Applicant and his co-offender in re-sentencing afresh and, in so doing, deal with the principles applicable thereto.
	


Parity Principle


	
	The principles of equal justice embody the norm expressed in the term “equality before the law” and are an aspect of the rule of law: Green v R; Quinn v R (2011) 244 CLR 463; [2011] HCA 49 at [28]. The principle, as has been stated a number of times, is a fundamental element in a rational and fair system of criminal justice (and beyond criminal justice).
	
	
	Inconsistency in punishment undermines the public perception in the fairness of the criminal justice system and the integrity of the administration of justice. Similarly, equality of treatment enhances the integrity of the justice system and is a matter of continuing importance to the administration of justice and to the community: Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606; [1984] HCA 46 at CLR 610 – 611.
	
	
	The principle requires identity of outcome in cases that are relevantly identical and requires different outcomes in cases that are different in a relevant respect. The difference in outcome must reflect differences in the circumstances of the offenders or differences in the cases of the offenders whose sentences are under comparison: Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295; [1997] HCA 26; Hilli v The Queen; Jones v The Queen (2010) 242 CLR 520; [2010] HCA 45.
	
	
	The principle was and continues to be a reflection of the application of the norm of equality before the law and involves this Court intervening only when there is a justifiable sense of grievance arising from the sentence imposed on another. In imposing a sentence at first instance or in resentencing on appeal, the parity principle must be applied to ensure that a difference in the sentence of co-offenders must reflect, rationally, the differences in the relevant respects of each offender.
	
	
	In the submissions of the Crown, the Court was urged to adopt a principle that, in order to give rise to a ground of appeal on disparity, the difference must be “gross, marked or glaring”: Tan v R [2014] NSWCCA 96 at [39], by reference to the discussion by Howie J in England v R; Phanith v R [2009] NSWCCA 274.
	
	
	Recently, Hamill J, in dissent (but not, it seems on this question of principle), said in Cameron v R [2017] NSWCCA 229 at [79] and following:
	


“[79]    The High Court has emphasised that the issue of parity is an application of the fundamental principle of equal justice. In his frequently cited dissenting judgment in Lowe v The Queen, Mason J said at 610-611:

‘Just as consistency in punishment – a reflection of the notion of equal justice – is a fundamental element in any rational and fair system of criminal justice, so inconsistency in punishment, because it is regarded as a badge of unfairness and unequal treatment under the law, is calculated to lead to an erosion of public confidence in the integrity of the administration of justice. It is for this reason that the avoidance and elimination of unjustifiable discrepancy in sentencing is a matter of abiding importance to the administration of justice and to the community.’

…

[81]    In Postiglione v The Queen, the High Court considered a case where ‘other things were not equal’, but the judgments established that the principle requires that there be a ‘due proportion’ between sentences in such cases. Dawson and Gaudron JJ said at 301-302:

‘The parity principle upon which the argument in this Court was mainly based is an aspect of equal justice. Equal justice requires that like should be treated alike but that, if there are relevant differences, due allowance should be made for them. In the case of co-offenders, different sentences may reflect different degrees of culpability or their different circumstances. If so, the notion of equal justice is not violated. On some occasions, different sentences may indicate that one or other of them is infected with error. Ordinarily, correction of the error will result in there being a due proportion between the sentences and there will then be equal justice. However, the parity principle, as identified and expounded in Lowe v The Queen, recognises that equal justice requires that, as between co-offenders, there should not be a marked disparity which gives rise to “a justifiable sense of grievance”. If there is, the sentence in issue should be reduced, notwithstanding that it is otherwise appropriate and within the permissible range of sentencing options.’

…

[82]    This passage shows that the parity principle is not to be applied in an unduly technical way and that an appeal court must consider the practical impact of the sentences imposed on two offenders in determining whether the disparity between the sentences is justified. Similar sentiments emerge from the High Court’s decision and judgments in Green & Quinn v The Queen.

…

[85]    In Tuivaga, Hoeben CJ at CL went on to cite with approval the following passage from the judgment of Latham J (Button J and Grove AJ agreeing) in Mammone v R:

‘45    ... The imposition of different sentences does not, without more, raise “equal justice” considerations. Moreover, a sense of grievance is only “justifiable” or legitimate if the application of objective criteria compels the court to that conclusion. The age, background, criminal history and role in the offence of various offenders may justify some disparity: Green v The Queen ; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49 at [31].

46    In particular, as the majority in Green & Quinn make clear,

“A court of criminal appeal deciding an appeal against the severity of a sentence on the ground of unjustified disparity will have regard to the qualitative and discretionary judgments required of the primary judge in drawing distinctions between co-offenders.”‘“ [Footnotes omitted.]


	
	With respect to Hamill J, I adopt that analysis. In the same judgment, Basten JA referred to international law principles relating to non-discrimination in the law and cited, with approval, Gaudron J in Street v Queensland Bar Association [1989] HCA 53; (1989) 168 CLR 461 at 571 with which comments I, with respect, also agree. As Hamill J pointed out at [86] – [90], the addition of an epithet relating to the disparity being gross or glaring does not reflect the test. The test remains whether the principles of equal justice have been misapplied.
	
	
	Of course, most cases involve differences between co-offenders. No two offenders are identical. A difference in sentence between one co-offender and another that is intended to reflect a difference in the circumstances of each offender is another example of the exercise of a sentencing judgment. Such a judgment should be the subject of interference only where the difference can be said not to reflect the difference between the relevant offenders.
	
	
	In other words, without using epithets or placing a gloss on the principle, different judges may arrive at different conclusions to reflect differences, each of which conclusion may be rational, reasonable and appropriate: see Wan v R [2017] NSWCCA 261 at [42] citing the judgment of the Court in DS v R [2014] NSWCCA 267 at [39], which makes clear that such descriptors are intended to ensure that the principle applies “where the discrepancy between the sentences is not reasonably explained by the degree of difference between co-offenders and their offending”.
	


Consideration


	
	It is necessary for the Court to reiterate that the purposes of sentencing described both in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and by the common law include punishment, general deterrence, specific deterrence, protection of the community, retribution and reform: Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465; [1988] HCA 14. Each of these purposes must be considered together and none can be considered in isolation.
	
	
	The process, often described as intuitive synthesis, is one in which the sentencing judge synthesises the objective seriousness of the offence with the subjective circumstances of the offender, bearing in mind each of the purposes of sentencing, and arrives at a result that best achieves a balance in those purposes. All of those purposes are guideposts and often they point in different directions.
	
	
	The principle of equal justice, which gives rise to the principle of parity, deals with the concept, as stated, that like should be treated alike and those that are relevantly different should be treated differently in a way that rationally reflects the differences between them.
	
	
	In my view, the sentence imposed upon the co-offender is at the very bottom of the range that could have been imposed. Nevertheless, the Crown does not suggest that the sentence imposed is impermissibly lenient. Nor has the Crown appealed the sentence imposed upon the co-offender.
	
	
	As a consequence, it is appropriate that the Applicant’s sentence rationally reflect the difference in offending between the Applicant and his co-offender. Were it not for parity, I would not impose a sentence lower than was imposed below.
	
	
	The comment that the sentence imposed upon the co-offender was at the bottom of the range or below it takes into account the guidepost that one of the offences carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment (together with a fine) and a standard non-parole period of 15 years imprisonment.
	
	
	The indicative sentence set for count 3 in relation to the Applicant is 4 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 2 years imprisonment. For the co-offender, for the same offence, which the sentencing judge wrongly describes as a “large quantity”, as distinct from “a large commercial quantity”, the indicative sentence set was 2 years and 3 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months. His Honour described the offence, in relation to the co-offender, as “below the mid-range of offending” (AB 205, ROS, co-offender at [47]).
	
	
	Each offender received the maximum discount for the plea of guilty at the earliest reasonable opportunity, being 25%. The five offences on the Form 1 are to be given effect in fixing a sentence in relation to count 3 in the Applicant’s charges.
	
	
	The Crown submits that there are significant differences in the Applicant’s conduct and that of his co-offender. In part, those significant differences relate to what is said to be the relative objective seriousness of the two offenders and the difference in moral culpability. Further, any sentence to be imposed on the Applicant must take account of the charges in counts 1 and 2, with which the co-offender was not charged.
	
	
	As already stated, I do not consider the subjective circumstances of the two offenders to be substantially different: see [23] – [27], supra. Nor do they require significantly different sentences to be imposed.
	
	
	Taking into account the Form 1 offences in relation to count 3 and bearing in mind the time of the offences in counts 1 and 2, adds significantly to the totality of the offending with which the Applicant is charged. The Form 1 offences can only be taken into account in fixing a sentence for count 3, but, in so doing, greater regard should be had for the need for specific deterrence and punishment and the greater culpability in relation to the charge in count 3.
	
	
	Moreover, the range of offences with which the Applicant is charged discloses offending over a period of approximately two months commencing 2 July 2015 and concluding 27 August 2015, whereas the co-offender’s charges all occurred on one day being 27 August 2015. Further, there are no Form 1 offences attached to any of the co-offender’s charges.
	
	
	Further, the two additional charges for which the Applicant was sentenced are each serious, involving, as they do, maximum sentences of 20 years imprisonment and life imprisonment respectively and in relation to the latter charge a standard non-parole period of 15 years imprisonment.
	
	
	These additional offences require an appropriately longer aggregate sentence on the Applicant than on his co-offender.
	
	
	The indicative sentences set for counts 1 and 2 were 2 years and 6 months imprisonment for count 1 and, for count 2, 3 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months. Given the existence of a standard non-parole period in relation to the offence charged in count 2, it was necessary for the learned sentencing judge to set a non-parole period in his indicative sentence.
	
	
	At the same time, the indicative sentence set in relation to count 3 of the Applicant, which must take account of the Form 1 offences and the need for a sentence to be imposed in the context of the ongoing nature of the offending, was 4 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years. For the co-offender, the indicative sentence set for the equivalent charge was a head sentence of 2 years and 3 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months imprisonment.
	
	
	For count 4, the sentencing judge set an indicative sentence for the Applicant of 3 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months imprisonment and, for his co-offender, a head sentence of 2 years imprisonment and a non-parole period of 12 months imprisonment. For count 5, the sentencing judge set an indicative sentence for the Applicant of 2 years imprisonment and, for his co-offender, 12 months imprisonment.
	
	
	The Crown submits that the Applicant and his co-offender had significantly different subjective circumstances and significantly different roles in the relevant offences. The difference in subjective circumstances seems to be more a result of the reluctance of the Applicant to discuss his and his family’s mental history than a significant difference in their mental state. Further, they were described as “partners” in the criminal offending and the objective evidence seems to suggest that neither obtained a profit from the offending, but each used the offending to support their own drug habit and such living expenses as they may have otherwise incurred.
	
	
	Each offender seems, on the objective material available, to be involved to a similar or like extent in the criminal offending for which they were both charged and any difference in the description of their offending seems to relate more to their use of language than it does to any significant difference in the offending for those three offences with which they were both charged.
	
	
	In light of the foregoing comments, the indicative sentence set for the Applicant in relation to counts 3, 4 and 5 does not reflect a rational differentiation between the offending of each of the offenders. The appeal, however, is against the aggregate sentence imposed; not the indicative sentences. Nevertheless, the difference in the indicative sentences discloses a disparity that is unwarranted and, in relation to the sentence to be imposed in this appeal, ought not be reflected in the orders proposed.
	
	
	The seriousness of the offences charged in counts 1 and 2, as already stated, requires the imposition of a significant sentence over and above that which would have been imposed were they not to have been committed. The effect of those counts, as already stated, relates to the seriousness of those offences, themselves, and the impact that this kind of offending, over a longer period of time, had on factors relating to specific deterrence, punishment and culpability in the offences charged and may lead to a significant penalty over and above that imposed on the co-offender.
	
	
	I propose that the Court set indicative sentences for the offences in the following way:
	



	
	Count 1 – between 2 July and 29 July 2015 Ongoing Supply of prohibited drug, contrary to s 25A(1) of the Drug Act – 2 years and 6 months imprisonment;
	
	
	Count 2 – between 2 July 2015 and 20 August 2015 Supply prohibited drug (large commercial quantity) (3, 4 MDMA), contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Act – 3 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 18 months imprisonment;
	
	
	Count 3 – on 27 August 2015 Supply prohibited drug (large commercial quantity) (3, 4 MDMA), contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Act (taking into account the five offences on the Form 1) 3 years and 6 months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months;
	
	
	Count 4 – on 27 August 2015, Supply prohibited drug (commercial quantity) (Cocaine), contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Act – 2 years and 6 months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 15 months;
	
	
	Count 5 – on 27 August 2015, Supply prohibited drug (methylamphetamine), contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Act – 18 months imprisonment.
	



	
	The foregoing continues the discount of 25% for the Applicant’s early plea of guilty and the finding of special circumstances. It is appropriate, for the reasons explained by the sentencing judge, that the Applicant receive a shorter non-parole period and a longer period during which the Applicant is eligible for parole.
	
	
	I propose that the Court impose an aggregate sentence, being a sentence of a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months, commencing 27 August 2015 and expiring 26 May 2019 and a balance of term of 3 years and 3 months concluding 26 August 2022.
	
	
	The Applicant would be first eligible for parole on 26 May 2019.
	
	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal be granted;
	
	
	Appeal be upheld;
	
	
	The sentence imposed on the Applicant, Benjamin Adam Miles, by the District Court on 10 June 2016, be quashed and in lieu thereof the following sentence be imposed:
	



	
	An aggregate sentence, being a sentence of a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months commencing 27 August 2015 and expiring 26 May 2019 and a balance of term of 3 years and 3 months, concluding 26 August 2022.
	
	
	The Applicant is first eligible for parole on 26 May 2019.
	



	
	HAMILL J:  I have had the very great benefit of reading the draft judgments of both Leeming JA and Rothman J.  I agree with the orders proposed by Rothman J and with the reasons his Honour articulates for those orders.  I also agree with the judgment of Leeming JA.

6455470,Nisan v R [2017] NSWCCA 265,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Schmidt J and the orders which she proposes.
	
	
	SCHMIDT J: In October 2014 Mr Nisan was driving a truck which was involved in a collision at the intersection of Warringah and Pittwater Roads, Dee Why. A number of people were seriously injured, including Mr Nisan. In November 2016, after a judge alone trial, Mr Nisan was convicted of two charges of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm and acquitted of four counts of wilful neglect occasioning bodily harm: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 21 November 2016, unrep).
	
	
	Mr Nisan was later sentenced to terms of imprisonment respectively of 3 years, with a non-parole period of 2 years dating from 4 April 2018 and 2 years with a non-parole period of 1 year and 9 months, dating from 4 April 2017: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 27 April 2017, unrep).
	
	
	Mr Nisan has appealed both his conviction and sentence.
	
	
	Mr Nisan’s case was that he had been wrongly convicted and that the sentence imposed upon him was manifestly excessive and inconsistent with the reasons earlier given by the trial judge in the conviction judgment. On appeal the grounds Mr Nisan advanced were:
	


“Conviction Appeal

1.   The trial judge erred in admitting into evidence over objection expert opinion evidence of Mr John Ruller relating to brake force efficiency in circumstances where the opinions were based on assumption that could not be made out in the evidence.

2.   The trial judge erred in admitted[sic] into evidence over objection as expert opinion evidence of Mr John Ruiler[sic] concerning the record of interview of the Appellant where that opinion evidence was outside the scope of his expertise.

3.   That the trial judge wrongly held that on the evidence there was no reasonable hypothesis inconsistent with guilt and the verdicts were unsafe, unsatisfactory or unreasonable in the circumstances.

4.   The trial judge erred in failing to give adequate reasons for her decision.

Particulars

a.   finding that when the appellant said in his record of interview ""the top of the hill"" he meant May Road and not west of Alfred Street.

b.   rejecting the evidence of Dr Hart and accepting the evidence of Mr Ruller.

c.   failing to address the submissions of the appellant relating to the credibility and reliability of Senior Constable Ben Wilson.

Severity Appeal

1.   That trial judge erred in her assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending in circumstances where that assessment was inconsistent with the trial judge's verdict and reasons for verdict.

2.   That the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.”

The sentence was manifestly excessive


	
	This was not a case which involved either death or deliberately dangerous conduct. It turned on whether it was brake failure, or Mr Nisan’s driving, that had caused the collision.
	
	
	At the hearing of the appeal the Crown conceded that the sentence imposed on Mr Nisan was very high. That concession was properly made.
	
	
	The truck was not owned by Mr Nisan, who was an employed driver. The evidence established that some of the truck’s brakes were out of adjustment and in cross-examination the Crown’s expert Mr Ruller (a crash scene investigator), said that he would not have driven the truck with the brakes in that state. There was no suggestion that Mr Nisan knew or should have known what the state of the brakes was.
	
	
	As I will come to explain, it is not entirely clear that in the conviction judgment the trial judge concluded that regardless of what conclusion was reached as to the number of brakes which were out of adjustment “the Crown cannot exclude the possibility that the poor adjustment caused the accident”. If that was not the conclusion reached, for reasons which I will explain, it ought to have been.
	
	
	If this was the trial judge’s conclusion, it is impossible to see how, consistently with that conclusion, her Honour then went on to “reject beyond reasonable doubt that brake fade was a cause of the accident”.
	
	
	Her Honour later also observed that she had “a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused acted in a conscious way or was conscious of his breach of the necessary standard of care” and that “[t]here is no evidence that he intended to drive in the way he did, or acted recklessly, rather than events overtaking him”.
	
	
	These findings were relevant on sentence to the assessment of the objective seriousness of Mr Nisan’s offences and his moral culpability for that offending. Despite making these findings, her Honour rejected his case that his moral culpability was low. Instead, her Honour concluded that it fell at the higher end of the scale; that the objective seriousness of his offending also fell at the higher end of the range; and that “all the circumstances demonstrate the abandonment of responsibility”.
	
	
	I am satisfied that neither those conclusions, nor the resulting sentences imposed on Mr Nisan, were properly open on the evidence received at trial and involved relevant error: House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499; [1936] HCA 40.
	
	
	Had I come to the conclusion that the conviction appeal should be dismissed, it would thus have been necessary to uphold the sentence appeal. Given that I consider that the conviction appeal must be upheld, it is unnecessary to consider the sentence appeal further.
	


Mr Nisan was wrongly convicted


	
	The onus fell on the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the manner of Mr Nisan’s driving was dangerous. Satisfaction on the balance of probabilities, or a finding of negligence could not result in his conviction of the dangerous driving charges which were found proven.
	
	
	For reasons which I will explain more fully in relation to the grounds of appeal, I consider that Mr Nisan was wrongly convicted; that his appeal must be upheld; and that he must be acquitted of both charges.
	
	
	In her judgment, the trial judge observed that the Crown’s case was that Mr Nisan had failed to control his fully laden truck, while driving down the steep incline to the intersection – safe driving requiring him to reduce his speed sufficiently, so that he could adhere to the 20kph speed limit, which applied to trucks on the steep descent at Warringah Hill. The Crown argued that during this descent, Mr Nisan had to drive in a gear no higher than third and to engage the truck’s exhaust brake. He had failed to do so, with the result that he had driven at excessive speed in the circumstances and in too high a gear.
	
	
	Mr Nisan’s case was that the brakes were not roadworthy and had been poorly adjusted, making them vulnerable to brake failure or fading. That was what had caused the accident, by preventing him from slowing the truck to the 20kph speed limit, as he had attempted to do.
	
	
	There was no issue that Mr Nisan was the driver of the truck and that the applicable Road Rule 108 of the Road Rules 2008 (NSW), required that on a road where a “trucks and buses low gear sign” applies, trucks must be driven in a gear low enough to limit the speed of the truck, without the use of primary breaks.
	
	
	It was also common ground that when Mr Nisan reached the intersection, the truck was travelling at a speed of some 65kph. The evidence established that if it was driven in low range, the maximum speed of the truck was 40kph. On investigation after the collision, the truck was found to be in low range, but not in gear. Being in neutral allowed its speed to increase to 65kph, even though it was in low range.
	
	
	Mr Nisan did not give evidence at trial, but both at the scene and afterwards, he made statements to police about what had caused the collision. On his accounts, the collision occurred because the truck’s brakes had failed. Those statements were considered by the parties’ experts, Mr Ruller and Dr Hart (a qualified engineer and electrical and mechanical engineering consultant).
	
	
	Mr Cowie, an experienced truck driver who witnessed the accident and was accepted to have relevant expertise, given that experience, gave evidence about what he observed and found when he lent aid at the scene of the collision. Other experts, Constable Wilson (a mechanic) and Dr White (a forensic mechanical engineer), had tested the vehicle.
	
	
	There were many differences of opinion between the experts. Many of the critical differences lying between Mr Ruller and Dr Hart were resolved in cross-examination.
	
	
	Evidence was also called from the owner of the truck, the mechanic who had maintained the brakes and the truck’s manufacturer. From this evidence it emerged that while the brakes had been maintained, the owner had supplied the “after market” brake linings which had been used on the last occasion they were adjusted, the month prior to the collision. They were not recommended by the manufacturer, but were not tested by either Constable Wilson or Dr White, to determine whether overheating had contributed to brake failure, as was Dr Hart’s opinion.
	
	
	The expert evidence ought to have led her Honour to the conclusion that the Crown could not exclude the possibility that it was the state of the brakes which had caused the collision, rather than Mr Nisan’s driving. That was because it finally became common ground between Mr Ruller and Dr Hart, that the brakes had faded during the truck’s descent down Warringah Hill. Where that occurred was what remained in issue.
	
	
	In concluding that Mr Nisan’s driving was dangerous, her Honour did not consider the evidence about whether the ‘after market’ brake linings had caused, or contributed to the brakes fading. That was relevant to the question of where it was that the brakes faded.
	
	
	Even so, I consider that Mr Ruller’s concession in cross-examination that the condition of the brakes was such that he would not have knowingly driven this truck and the common view of Dr Hart and Mr Ruller, that if the brakes had been working properly, they would have been capable of stopping this truck on the descent, it was not open to her Honour to find that the Crown had proven beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Nisan’s driving was dangerous, or that it had caused the collision.
	


Ground 1 – admission of expert evidence based on assumptions


	
	Mr Ruller’s opinions rested on a series of identified assumptions. They included brake temperatures, on which various of his calculations were based, and what Mr Nisan had meant by some of his responses during his police interview.
	
	
	The trial judge rejected the objection to Mr Ruller's evidence: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 16 October 2016, unrep).
	
	
	Dr Hart’s opinions also rested on various assumptions, including as to the brakes having overheated and what Mr Nisan had meant by his police interview responses.
	
	
	Mr Cowie’s evidence provided an objective basis for the conclusion that the brakes had overheated, given what he described smelling at the scene of the collision. Mr Ruller agreed that this indicated overheating and conceded that there was no way to verify the actual temperatures which the truck’s various brakes had reached.
	
	
	On Mr Nisan’s case on appeal, that it was not possible to establish the temperature of the brakes was fatal to the admissibility of Mr Ruller’s evidence: Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles (2001) 52 NSWLR 705; [2001] NSWCA 305. Further, it was argued that her Honour’s reasons revealed that she had concerned herself with whether there was any basis for the defence to argue that overheating was a significant issue, in relation to the effectiveness of the brakes, rather than the admissibility of Mr Ruller’s evidence.
	
	
	In the circumstances Mr Ruller’s evidence should not have been admitted and in the absence of his opinions, the Crown’s case should have been rejected as not having established Mr Nisan’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	In rejecting the objection to Mr Ruller's evidence, the trial judge noted that the only evidence of overheating of the brakes came from Mr Cowie, who said that such overheating had been suggested to him by an asbestos-type smell. In his interview with police, Mr Nisan had not said anything about having had any trouble with the brakes, up until this occasion. Her Honour also noted evidence that in normal circumstances, there would have been no heating of the brakes.
	
	
	After referring to evidence foreshadowed in the defence case and to Heydon JA’s observations in Makita at [85], her Honour concluded that Mr Ruller's opinions, while based on assumptions, were “not assumptions without having a grounding or founding in his knowledge and expertise and, in my view, he is entitled to give the estimates he has given”: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 16 October 2016, unrep) at 3.
	
	
	Makita was considered in Dasreef Pty Ltd v Hawchar (2011) 243 CLR 588; [2011] HCA 21. What was there decided has since been repeatedly considered by this Court. Recently in Taub v R [2017] NSWCCA 198, Simpson JA observed, for example:
	


“27    The plurality in Dasreef refined Heydon JA’s seven admissibility criteria in Makita to two:


	
	that the witness who gives the evidence “has specialised knowledge based on the person’s training, study or experience”; and
	
	
	that the opinion expressed in the evidence by the witness “is wholly or substantially based on that knowledge” ([32]).
	


28    What was in issue in Dasreef was whether the opinion expressed by the witness proffered as an expert was based on the witness’ specialised knowledge based on his training, study or experience.

29    The plurality added (citing [85] of Makita) that:

“… ordinarily … ‘the expert’s evidence must explain how the field of ‘specialised knowledge’ in which the witness is expert by reason of ‘training, study or experience’, and on which the opinion is ‘wholly or substantially based’, applies to the facts assumed or observed so as to produce the opinion propounded’.” ([37])

30    This, it appears to me, states a third criterion of admissibility. Their Honours then emphasised (at [42]) that satisfaction of the criteria is a matter that goes to the admissibility of, not the weight to be attributed to, the opinion evidence.

31    The plurality declined to engage with the question whether the “proof of assumption rule” (what their Honours called “the basis rule”) existed at common law; such a rule, their Honours said, was directed to the facts of a particular case. From that it might be inferred that their Honours considered that whether the facts upon which the opinion was based are established as true is a question that goes not to admissibility, but to the weight to be attributed to the opinion expressed. This is also the analysis of Schmidt J in Kyluk Pty Ltd v Chief Executive, Office of Environment and Heritage (2013) 298 ALR 532; [2013] NSWCCA 114 at [176]-[177].

32    It seems to me that the difference between Heydon J and the plurality lies in the rigour with which Heydon J would insist on the availability of evidence to prove the truth, or correctness, of the assumptions or facts forming the foundation of the opinion as a condition of admissibility and at the time admissibility is being considered. It is not the position of Heydon J that, before evidence of the opinion could be admitted, it was necessary that the assumptions or facts be proved to be true or correct; rather, it was necessary that it be shown that ultimately the evidence would be capable of establishing that the facts or assumptions were true or correct. To insist on the availability of evidence to prove the truth of the assumptions enhances efficiency of the trial process (see [127]). Whether the evidence succeeds in establishing the truth of the facts is a question for the trier of fact.

33    The plurality, on the other hand, would allow admission of the opinion evidence provided the reasoning was exposed, reserving to the tribunal of fact whether the evidence was sufficient to establish the truth or correctness of the assumptions or facts. Failure to prove the truth of the assumptions would render the opinion evidence of little or no value.”


	
	It follows that the trial judge did not err in admitting Mr Ruller’s evidence. If, however, at trial the Crown failed to prove the assumptions on which Mr Ruller’s opinions rested, they would be of little or no value, in establishing the Crown case, as her Honour observed in the conviction judgment.
	
	
	In relation to Mr Ruller’s evidence, the trial judge noted, for example, that he had used the wrong graph in coming to conclusions about the power of the exhaust brake. Her Honour did not conclude that his opinion about this was of little or no value, because it had no foundation, as the trial judge had earlier indicated would be her approach. She observed, however, that this “undermines” Mr Ruller: see R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 22 November 2016, unrep) at 21.
	
	
	Her Honour also referred to Mr Ruller’s concessions that a critical assumption he had made about the brake temperature could not be verified; that the front brakes had been poorly adjusted; and that there had been brake fade, albeit in his view, near the end of the descent on Warringah Hill. Despite this, and without referring to the evidence she had earlier noted Dr Hart had given about the ‘after market’ brake linings contributing to the overheating of the brakes and their fading, her Honour accepted Mr Ruller’s opinion that “the brakes, albeit not perfect, were not determinative of the events”: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 22 November 2016, unrep) at 32. This approach did not accord with that of the plurality in Dasreef, or that which her Honour had said that she would adopt.
	
	
	Despite this, the first ground of appeal must be rejected. The trial judge did not err in admitting Mr Ruller’s evidence. If the assumptions on which his opinions were based were not established by the evidence led at trial, they could not, however be relied on in determining whether the Crown had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.
	


Ground 4 – the reasons given were inadequate


	
	It is convenient to next deal with ground 4.
	
	
	The obligation to give reasons in a judge alone trial is governed by s 133(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). The trial judge was also obliged to explain the reasons for the findings of fact which she made: Fleming v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 250; [1998] HCA 68 at [30] and to expose her reasoning process: Filippou v The Queen (2015) 256 CLR 47; [2015] HCA 29 at [6].
	


The conviction judgment


	
	The conviction judgment was delivered orally on 21 and 22 November 2016, after judgment was reserved on 26 October. Mr Nisan’s case that the majority of the judgment dealt with an outline of the evidence and the parties’ submissions must be accepted.
	
	
	There was no issue taken with the various binding principles to which the trial judge referred. She also noted that the test of whether Mr Nisan had been driving dangerously was an objective one, which did not require the Crown to establish that he knew or realised that he was driving the truck in a dangerous manner. Her Honour also observed that the Crown's case was circumstantial and that Mr Nisan had advanced two hypotheses consistent with his innocence:
	


“1   Dr White is (reasonably) possibly correct. If Dr White is possibly correct then it is possible the truck’s foot brakes were unroadworthy and if the truck’s foot brakes were unroadworthy then the truck itself is unroadworthy.

2   If Dr White is wrong and Mr Ruller is correct, based on Senior Constable Wilson’s measurements Mr Ruller says the front brakes were poorly adjusted, then Dr Hart says even one or two poorly adjusted brakes could make the truck more vulnerable to brake fade and brake fade was the cause of the accident”: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 21 November 2016, unrep) at 9.


	
	The trial judge referred extensively to a chronology of relevant events, including dates when the brakes had been adjusted prior to the collision, the last time on 11 September 2014. Her Honour then turned to explain where the collision occurred on 21 October 2014, before turning to the Crown which was explained to be:
	


“The Crown submitted the Crown case is that the accused failed to control a fully laden truck down a steep decline, such that it struck a number of cars at the intersection of Pittwater Road and Warringah Road, seriously injuring two persons in a Mazda 2 and injuring four others. The Crown case is that in order to drive safely down a steep decline the accused needed to reduce his speed sufficiently so that he could adhere to the signposted 20 kilometre per hour sign which, for this truck, meant that he could not have been in more than third gear. He should have engaged the exhaust brake but he did not. The Crown case is that the accused was travelling at an excessive speed in the circumstances and was consequently in too high a gear to drive safely down the decline.

His actions thereafter only made it more likely that the outcome would be disastrous, in that he tried to gear down, which at least disengages the engine and therefore the ability to brake, or worse, can end up in the engine going into the wrong, that is a higher, gear, making it more difficult to brake, or at worst, that the truck goes into neutral gear and therefore has far less ability to brake. Secondly, that he did not use the exhaust brake which, if engaged, has a retarding effect on the engine. Third, that he attempted to use the hand brake which, in normal circumstances, cannot be engaged whilst the service brake is engaged.

He was at this point, the Crown said, panicking, as he acknowledged in the later part of his interview, because, the Crown says, he knew the peril he was in”: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 21 November 2016, unrep) at 18 – 19.


	
	The circumstances relied on by the Crown were identified to be:
	


“1.   That the truck was travelling at an excessive speed, about 65 kilometres per hour, immediately prior to impact;

2.   That the gearstick was in neutral post-impact;

3.   That the exhaust brake was not engaged;

4.   That the brakes were serviceable, albeit not at maximum braking efficiency;

5.   That the accused admitted he was the driver (no dispute);

6.   The accused denied speeding and asserted brake failure. The Crown submits this is unreliable; and

7.   He was going about 40 kilometres per hour at the third pair of 20 kilometre per hour signs”: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 21 November 2016, unrep) at 22 – 23.


	
	Her Honour then observed that the Crown had the onus of “excluding to my satisfaction that guilt is the only rational hypotheses or reasonable inference”: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 21 November 2016, unrep) at 23.
	
	
	The trial judge then turned to the expert evidence, noting that its value depended on the reliability and accuracy of the material which the experts had used, in order to arrive at their opinions. Her Honour noted that there were conflicts between the opinions of Mr Ruller, Constable Wilson, Dr Hart and Dr White. She then outlined their respective opinions and what they were based on, in considerable detail, noting that only Constable Wilson had physically examined the truck, in a condition which was said to be the same as at the time of the collision.
	
	
	As to Mr Ruller, her Honour noted that in summary, his opinions were:
	


“1.    The signage along Warringah Road was sufficient and provided ample warning to drivers of heavy vehicles that there was a steep descent ahead.

2.    The brakes fitted to the truck were in proper working order with the exception of the front brakes. In particular the front left steer brake was out of adjustment. The front right steer brake was almost out of adjustment.

3.    All four wheel groups on the drive and lazy axles had sufficient brake adjustment. If the brakes were operating at a temperature under 300 degrees Fahrenheit they would have had sufficient brake adjustment to allow for wheel lockup.

4.    If the four wheel groups on the drive axles had an operational brake temperature about 400 degrees Fahrenheit there would be a reduction in the brake efficiency. However, the brake adjustment would still have been sufficient to bring the truck to a stop from 65 kilometres per hour whilst on the descent towards Pittwater Road.

5.    Based on the statements provided by Mr Nisan during interview, his knowledge of the exhaust brake would appear to be limited. It would be my opinion that the exhaust brake was not in operation at the time of the crash. This would reduce considerably the deceleration of the vehicle as it travelled down the hill.

6.    The minimum gear that the truck would have been in at the top of the hill if the estimated speed of 40 kilometres per hour provided by Mr Nisan is accepted would have been fifth gear.

7.    This incident is a direct result of Mr Nisan failing to reduce the speed of the truck and choosing the correct gearing prior to attempting to descend the hill”: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 21 November 2016, unrep) at 30 – 31.


	
	Later her Honour referred to the cross-examination where Mr Ruller agreed that in his second report he had said that the brakes on the steer axle were in poor condition and in need of adjustment and that the truck was not fit to be on the road and that the truck driver may not have been aware of this, until he started feeling that he had to use more air pressure.
	
	
	As to brake temperature, her Honour noted that without allowing for heat in the brakes, Mr Ruller assessed their overall efficiency to be about 85% and with heat above 400°F, about 77%, but that still allowed considerable braking of the truck: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 21 November 2016, unrep) at 29.
	
	
	Her Honour also noted Mr Ruller’s agreement with Dr White, that the truck's foundation brake assembly was roadworthy and in generally good condition, but that he had disagreed with his other conclusions, in whole or in part. She also noted Mr Ruller’s observations about conclusions reached by Dr Hart and evidence which Mr Ruller gave in cross-examination, including that brake fade could have been a contributing factor to the accident, in its later stages: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 21 November 2016, unrep) at 39.
	
	
	After outlining the evidence of the other experts and what Mr Nisan had told police after the collision, her Honour noted that the Crown's case was that the truck was not suffering a mechanical defect, relevant to causation. She then turned to summarise, again in considerable detail, both the Crown and defence case, by reference to the evidence.
	
	
	Her Honour dealt with ‘The Crown key points”, namely, “The Brakes and the Experts” – where she noted that it was “[a]greed that poorly adjusted brakes fade at a lower temperature. Agreed between Hart and Ruller that brake fade played a part.” She then turned to “The Interview” and “Brake Fade”, observing that “The experts agree that brake fade played a part”.
	
	
	The trial judge then turned to “The defence key points”, beginning with “Introduction”, then “Mr Nisan’s version”, “The consequences of having the front brakes out of alignment” and “The brake force calculations of Mr Ruller”, noting the Crown case that the brakes were poorly adjusted. She then turned to “Other particulars of the offences alleged by the Crown”, beginning with “Incorrect gear selection”, then “the exhaust brake”, “use of handbrake , “good character” and “speed of truck at bottom of Hill”
	
	
	The trial judge then turned to “Conclusion”. There had not earlier been a ‘conclusion’ section, when her Honour summarised the Crown’s “key points”. Whether what her Honour said at this point of her judgment, was intended to be an explanation of the defence’s final ‘key points’, or her Honour’s conclusion, is not entirely clear. Her Honour said:
	


“The Court must find that (a) it is possible that the condition of the brakes was as bad as Dr White says they were; or (b) the condition of the brakes was as Mr Ruller reported, that is, the front brakes were poorly adjusted. Regardless of which finding I come to, were one, two or five brakes out of adjustment, the Crown cannot exclude the possibility that the poor adjustment caused the accident.

I will just go back. The Court must find that:

(a)    It is possible that the condition of the brakes was as bad as Dr White says they were, or,

(b)    The condition of the brakes were as Mr Ruller reported, that is, the front brakes were poorly adjusted.

Regardless of which finding I come to, were one, two or five brakes out of adjustment, the Crown cannot exclude the possibility that the poor adjustment caused the accident because:

(a) If Dr White is correct, the truck’s brakes, and therefore the truck, was not roadworthy; or,

(b) If Mr Ruller is correct, then as Dr Hart says that even one or two poorly adjusted brakes could make the truck more vulnerable to brake fade, and brake fade was the cause of the accident.

Having considered all of the evidence, and the lengthy submissions of counsel, I will now consider the individual circumstances brought forward by the Crown and the two hypotheses contended for by the defence. What I say under each heading is somewhat of a summary but it is essentially the reasons for the view that I come to in respect of each.

I will also consider whether there is any other alternative hypothesis consistent with innocence.”


	
	What her Honour here initially twice observed, when she began “[t]he Court must find that”, reflected the defence submissions. There was an issue as to whether Dr White or Mr Ruller’s opinion about the state of the brakes would be accepted, which had to be resolved. It was the defence case that whichever opinion was accepted, the Crown could not exclude the possibility that poor adjustment had caused the accident.
	
	
	Her Honour appeared to accept this, when she went on to say that:
	


“Regardless of which finding I come to, were one, two or five brakes out of adjustment, the Crown cannot exclude the possibility that the poor adjustment caused the accident because:

(a)    If Dr White is correct, the truck’s brakes, and therefore the truck, was not roadworthy; or,

(b)    If Mr Ruller is correct, then as Dr Hart says that even one or two poorly adjusted brakes could make the truck more vulnerable to brake fade, and brake fade was the cause of the accident.”


	
	If that is correct, the conclusion to which her Honour finally came, that the Crown had proven its case, was inconsistent with this finding.
	
	
	To understand how her Honour came to conclude that the Crown had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt, it is best to record what her Honour then held in relation to the circumstances the Crown had advanced and the hypotheses the defence had raised. To that point the judgment did not clearly identify the matters over which the parties had joined issue. In the conclusions reached, there was no reference to matters which had been resolved in the cross-examination of Mr Ruller, as was apparent from her Honour’s earlier summary of his and Dr Hart’s evidence.
	
	
	The reasoning for some of the conclusions which her Honour reached by the summary method which she adopted, is difficult to follow. Some of the conclusions are affected by her Honour’s erroneous approach to the expert evidence and some of her Honour’s findings are contradictory. In the result, Mr Nisan’s case that the reasons given are inadequate must be accepted.
	
	
	The trial judge’s conclusions were:
	


CIRCUMSTANCE ONE

That the truck was travelling at an excessive speed, about 65 kilometres per hour, immediately prior to impact. I accept Senior Constable Fenton’s evidence about this. Other lay evidence does not affect my view of his accuracy.

The unchallenged evidence of Senior Constable Fenton is that the average speed of the truck over a distance of 24 to 32 metres, ending at the median strip at Pittwater Road, was 65 kilometres an hour. Mr Ruller supported the methodology of Senior Constable Fenton.

CIRCUMSTANCE TWO

That the gearstick was in neutral post impact. I accept Senior Constable Wilson’s evidence about this.

Under circumstance three, the evidence of Mr Grgic, the tow truck driver who towed the truck from the collision site to the RMS, is summarised. I accept his evidence beyond reasonable doubt. This supports Senior Constable Wilson’s evidence.

CIRCUMSTANCE THREE

That the exhaust brake was not engaged. I accept Senior Constable Wilson’s evidence about this. He said when he examined the truck it was “off”.

I accept Mr Ruller when he said, “It would be my opinion that the exhaust brake was not in operation at the time of the crash”.

I accept Dean Grgic’s evidence that he did not touch anything to do with the gearbox, brakes or suspension.

I also accept his evidence the other fellow with him did not touch anything. He said, “I can guarantee a hundred percent.” He said about himself, “I can tell you a hundred percent I did not touch the gearbox, the suspension or the brakes”. He was an impressive witness.

Mr Cowie said he did not hear the noise he would have expected to hear if the exhaust brake was on.

CIRCUMSTANCE FOUR

That the brakes were serviceable, albeit not at maximum braking efficiency. The history of the servicing of the brakes is noted in the chronology and does not need to be repeated.

I am satisfied the brakes had been serviced in an appropriate and timely way.

It was Senior Constable Wilson who examined the truck in the most ideal circumstances. He was the only expert who physically examined the truck in a condition when it can be said it was the same as at the time of the collision.

He conducted an electronic brake roller test with an approved device and all the brakes received a pass.

Dr White, Senior Constable Wilson and Mr Ruller agreed the truck’s foundation brake assemblies were roadworthy and generally in good condition.

Senior Constable Wilson relied on his having tested the truck shortly after the accident with the truck running and he utilised the foot pedal. He relied on the Roads and Maritime Services brake roller test result and his photos.

Mr Ruller had no concern about Senior Constable Wilson’s methodology, nor did Dr Hart.

All these matters favour his results as being accurate.

I have no concern about Senior Constable Wilson’s credit. I found him to be a careful expert witness. His handwritten report was tendered (Exhibit PP).

Mr Ruller said the truck should be tested loaded, although the Roads and Maritime Services do not require this. He had a different view to Senior Constable Wilson about this.

In any event, he concluded even given the adjustment problem with the steer axle - and he was of the view clearly there was a problem with the steer axle adjustment, and I have already analysed his evidence and summarised it - the brakes were sufficient, or the braking ability was sufficient to control the truck.

Dr White examined the truck in an uncontrolled, unsecured situation. There had been a month of weathering.

I accept, having considered all of the evidence, this circumstance. In support of this finding, I also note what is found under “Hypothesis One”.

CIRCUMSTANCE FIVE

That the accused admitted he was the driver (no dispute). I am satisfied of this.

CIRCUMSTANCE SIX

The accused denied speeding asserted brake failure (unreliable). These assertions are dealt with elsewhere under “Circumstance Seven” and “Circumstance Four”.

CIRCUMSTANCE SEVEN

He was going about 40 kilometres per hour at the third pair of 20 kilometre per hour signs. The accused must be in error when he said he went down to low gear one in the interview. In low gear one, the maximum speed is 12 kilometres per hour (Exhibit XX).

Dr Hart agreed with Mr Ruller that Mr Nisan could not have been in gear one low ratio.

He should have been in third gear prior to reach the top of the hill.

Mr Ruller independently came to the view the Crown contends for, being the accused meant the top of the hill as May Road, not back up west of Alfred.

After some concern, I am satisfied the accused meant the top of the hill to be the top of the hill. The downhill part is where the third 20 sign is as the Crown contends. The accused signals with his hands in the interview at about this point.

I accept this circumstance.

HYPOTHESIS ONE

Dr White is (reasonably) possibly correct. If Dr White is possibly correct then it is possible the truck’s foot brakes were unroadworthy and if the truck’s footbrakes were unroadworthy then the truck itself is unroadworthy.

Dr White examined the truck in an uncontrolled, unsecured situation.

Mr Ruller noted, and I agree, if the brakes were as bad as Dr White said, they would have failed well before that hill. Some 50-odd kilometres was driven. Well before then, they would have failed.

The viewing of the photographs is inconsistent with the evidence of Dr White as already noted. Wilson, White and Hart say in adjustment (Exhibits UU, TT, A) from looking at the angles, and that is in relation to the right (driver or offside) axle 2; and Wilson and Hart say in adjustment (Exhibits A, TT) from looking at the angles, and that is in relation to the right (driver or offside) axle 3.

Dr White agreed the brakes could have been backed off in between his test and the earlier testing of Senior Constable Wilson.

Dr White accepted the condition Senior Constable Wilson examined the truck in was to be preferred.

He could not explain the big difference in the figures between those he obtained and those Senior Constable Wilson obtained, nor could Dr Hart. Dr Hart said he was unable to reconcile them. Dr Hart could not say which expert was correct.

I accept there is no actual evidence of the brakes being backed off. Having said that, such is a possibility. There is clearly a gap which is apparent from the summary of the evidence concerning the movement of the vehicle.

Senior Constable Wilson carried out two tests. He filled out the form, Exhibit PP. He has a professional disinterest in the measurements and Dr White agreed with him about the front brakes.

If Dr White is right, why did the truck not fail the Maha test?

In relation to this hypothesis, I also rely on my findings under Circumstance Four.

I accept the Crown submission Senior Constable Wilson’s measurements are supported by the totality of the evidence on the measurements on the back brakes.

I reject beyond reasonable doubt the evidence of Dr White about the back brakes. In my view, his evidence is not possibly correct.

HYPOTHESIS TWO

If Dr White is wrong and Mr Ruller is correct, based on Senior Constable Wilson’s measurements Mr Ruller says the front brakes were poorly adjusted and Dr Hart says even one or two poorly adjusted brakes could make the truck more vulnerable to brake fade and brake fade was the cause of the accident.

If Mr Nisan was driving at too high a speed too late, which I accept, then this would have inhibited his ability to gear down and consequentially slow his speed.

Mr Ruller accepts brake fade “near the end” but by then the damage had been done. The dangerous driving had resulted in a disastrous outcome.

I repeat again the Crown submission already noted at transcript p 1029:

‘His actions thereafter only made it more likely that the outcome would be disastrous, in that he tried to gear down, which at least disengages the engine and therefore the ability to brake, or worse, can end up in the engine going into the wrong, that is, a higher gear, making it more difficult to brake, or at worst, that the truck goes into neutral and therefore has far less ability to brake; secondly, that he did not use the exhaust brake which, if engaged, has a retarding effect on the engine; third, that he attempted to use the handbrake which, in normal circumstances, cannot be engaged while the service brake is engaged.’

I accept Mr Ruller’s evidence that the brakes, albeit not perfect, were not determinative of the events.

I have real difficulty with Dr Hart’s opinion applying common sense. As Mr Ruller, said Mr Nisan was the driver of the same truck over the same route the day before but there was no crash.

Mr Ruller said, as already stated:

‘[32]   On p 77 at line 1559 of the Hart Report [he also] states the following:

‘The truck route was 55 kilometres. I estimated that there are 88 potential stopping or slowing points on the route not dependent upon traffic density. There are several steep hills at the Warringah Road end of the journey. It is likely that the truck brakes were ‘hot’ when it reached the final descent on Warringah Road. Hot brakes have a drum temperature exceeding 250 degrees Centigrade. Extreme brake temperature is greater than 350 degrees Centigrade. It is plausible that the brakes were at extreme temperature on the final descent.’

[33]    If the driver has driven the truck in a manner as described above, he should never have been behind the wheel of the truck. Mr Nisan was the driver of the same truck the previous day yet there was no crash as would be expected had he driven in the manner suggested by Mr(sic) Hart. This comment would seem to suggest that any truck on the road at any time following the same route would suffer brake fade prior to travelling down this grade.’

Dr Hart’s evidence was effectively the brakes could have faded out at any time.

As a matter of common sense also, and based on the hypothesis put forward by Dr Hart, trucks should have their brakes fade down that hill virtually every day. His answer to this was, ‘It is a notorious hill.’

I reject beyond reasonable doubt brake fade was a cause of the accident.

In my view, the accident was not caused by any mechanical defect or brake fade. I reject both of these as being reasonably possible.

Given my acceptance of the circumstances relied upon by the Crown, I am satisfied that these together prove to my satisfaction the element in dispute in this trial, being at the time of the impact the accused was driving the vehicle in a manner dangerous to another person. This is the only reasonable inference or conclusion that can be drawn. There is no other alternative hypothesis consistent with innocence”: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 22 November 2016, unrep) at 25 – 31.


	
	If the trial judge’s conclusion was that “the Crown cannot exclude the possibility that the poor adjustment caused the accident”, her rejection “beyond reasonable doubt that brake fade was a cause of the accident”, was inconsistent with that finding. In any event, the latter conclusion was wrong, given the expert evidence, to which I will come.
	
	
	Her Honour’s conclusion was sought to be supported by what is described to be “common sense”: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 22 November 2016, unrep) at 32. A finding that it was possible that it was the brakes which had caused this collision, rather than Mr Nisan’s driving, could not conceivably lead to the conclusion that if there had been brake fade “trucks should have their brakes fail down that hill virtually every day”, as the trial judge postulated: see R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 22 November 2016, unrep) at 32.
	
	
	Further, not only was it the common view of Mr Ruller and Dr Hart that there were problems with the functioning of the brakes, which had led to them fading as Mr Nisan attempted to slow down on Warringah Hill, how they had been maintained was relevant to what had caused them to fade. The trial judge gave no reasons, however, for the conclusion that “the brakes had been serviced in an appropriate and timely way”: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 22 November 2016, unrep) at 28. That conclusion was contrary to the evidence of Dr Hart and the manufacturer of the truck.
	
	
	Additionally, not only was there objective evidence that the brakes had overheated, but both Mr Ruller and Dr Hart agreed that the brakes had faded. Dr Hart’s opinion was that the ‘after market’ brake linings had contributed to the overheating, which resulted in the brakes fading. This was not referred to in the trial judge’s conclusions.
	
	
	The conclusion that the reasons given were inadequate is reinforced by the trial judge’s reference to the fact that the truck’s brakes had not failed the preceding day. In her view that precluded the conclusion that they had failed on the day of the collision, also as a matter of ‘common sense’. That is quite illogical, particularly when considered in light of what the experts had agreed, to which I will come.
	
	
	In the result, the conclusion that the reasons given were inadequate is inescapable. Accordingly, this ground of appeal should be upheld.
	


Grounds 2 and 4(a) – Mr Nisan’s record of interview


	
	There was an issue between the parties as to what Mr Nisan had meant when he answered questions about his speed; the point at which he had attempted to slow down; and what he had done when changing the gears. Mr Ruller and Dr Hart each considered his answers and had made different assumptions about what Mr Nisan had meant, in arriving at their opinions.
	
	
	This fell to her Honour to resolve, in deciding whether their opinions could be accepted.
	
	
	In final submissions the parties addressed what Mr Nisan had said at various points during the interview, submissions to which her Honour addressed various questions. Her Honour finally accepted the Crown's submissions as to what Mr Nisan had meant, in the result coming to the same conclusion that Mr Ruller had reached in his report, namely, that Mr Nisan had only attempted to reduce his speed, when he reached the second 20kph speed sign.
	
	
	It follows that admission of Mr Ruller’s opinions, based as they were in part by what he understood Mr Nisan to have meant, is unlike the circumstances which arose for consideration in R v Banhelyi [2012] QCA 357. There it was concluded that Mr Ruller did not have the expertise to form opinions as to what was depicted in video footage which recorded the activation of indicator and brake lights.
	
	
	Mr Nisan’s answers on interview, it may be accepted, were not entirely clear. Fairly read, however, what he said about how he had attempted to reduce the speed of the truck, which was in low range, from 40kph to 20kph, by taking his foot off the accelerator and changing gears down, eventually to one, while using the footbrake, prior to the 20kph speed zone, could not reasonably be understood to have meant that he had only attempted to reduce the truck’s speed at the first 20kph speed limit sign, rather than the first warning sign of the reduced speed zone which he knew was ahead, having driven this route twice or more a week for some two years.
	
	
	It follows that while her Honour did not err in admitting Mr Ruller’s assumptions about what Mr Nisan had meant, in coming to the same conclusions as he did about what Mr Nisan meant and then accepting Mr Ruller’s opinions about where it was that Mr Nisan began slowing the truck, her Honour erred. Mr Ruller’s assumptions were not made good by a fair reading of what Mr Nisan told police who interviewed him and accordingly his opinion could not be accepted.
	
	
	Mr Nisan’s answers had to be understood in the context that the speed limit on the long descent to the intersection at the foot of Warringah Hill was initially 70kph and later 60kph. On the steep part of the descent the limit for trucks was 20kph. Before this 20kph zone was reached, there were two sets (a set being one sign on each side of the road) of white and black signs warning of the approaching 20kph speed limit. There were then two sets of red and white 20kph speed limit signs, the first at the top of the steep descent and another further on. Shortly before the intersection was another sign, which indicated the end of the 20kph zone.
	
	
	What Mr Nisan said when initially asked on interview to start “from the beginning” was:
	


“A (Int):   We are the drivers. We know this downhill ah, the speed is twenty, twenty. Oh, there are two signs, one of them black and white. Ah, due to the fact that I've been ah, driving on that direction to Dee Why for the last two years I know that street or road very, very well, I know that sign, the first one, the black and white. Before reaching the sign I start, I start reducing the speed. When I reached the second sign the speed would be twenty and I will never drive more than twenty, maybe less than twenty. Before reaching the first sign I was starting to reduce the speed. It was, yeah, it was under the forty before reaching the twenty, twenty speed area. I attempted to reduce the speed to twenty. At the top of the hill I was braking, braking to reduce the speed, but didn't go down. I realised the problem was with the brake, braking. I tried to pull the handbrake to stop the speed downhill. It didn't work. It was unsuccessful. The truck was loaded. The speed, the truck's speed increased, started to increase down the hill. I tried until the last minute pressing on the brake. Can I continue?

Q21   Ah hmm.

A (Int):   I realised that’s it, no chance by braking. I saw the cars in front of me. I tried to prevent my truck to go immediately into the cars in front of me. I tried to turn the truck to the left. I tried but what happened happened. The truck flipped on its side.”


	
	Her Honour did not refer to Mr Nisan’s answer to question 20, or the detail of what he said elsewhere in this interview in her conclusions. There she said that:
	


“I am satisfied the accused meant the top of the hill to be the top of the hill. The downhill part is where the third 20 sign is as the Crown contends. The accused signals with his hands in the interview at about this point.”


	
	What Mr Nisan meant by his answer was, however, extensively explored in the interview.
	
	
	Answers to questions 52 to 54 disclosed that Mr Nisan had been working for his employer for two years, driving this route twice or more a week. He agreed that he knew the road well. In questions 56 to 61 he was asked about the number of signs on the road. He answered:
	


“Q56   O.K. Now, I think you told me when you were coming down the road there were two signs, one black and white. What does that sign say?

A (Int):   It's a black and white sign. It's warning, warning the drivers that the speed will become twenty.

Q57   And where is that sign situated, on your left or on your right?

A (Int):   On the right.

Q58   Now, you said there was two. That's one sign, black and white. What's

the other sign you're referring to?

A (Int):   Ah, after the black and white there is the red and white sign.

Q59   And where is that situated?

A (Int):   Both sides. Oh, yeah, I am, sure on the right, but maybe both of them on both sides, but I am sure the sign on the right.

Q60   [19.09] O.K. So are you saying there's two signs or maybe three signs now?

A (Int):   Two black and white and two red and white.

Q61   And if I was to suggest to you that there were actually more than four signs what could you say about that?

A (Int):   Four signs, two black and white and two red and white.”


	
	Mr Nisan was also asked:
	


“Q62   Now, you said you started reducing speed. What were, speed were you going prior to reducing your speed?

A (int):   Forty. Yeah, it was forty before reaching the area, before reaching the sign.

Q63   Then I think you said when you reached the second sign you were doing twenty or maybe less than twenty.

A (int):   But not today. Today, I didn't go down to twenty today.

Q64   What was the speed that you reduced to prior to putting your brakes on?

A (Int):   Before reaching the black and white sign down to forty. I attempted to go down to twenty. It failed. It didn't. The speed increased, started to increase when I was braking.

Q65   The twenty sign, is that before you start to go down the hill?

A (Int):   Yes, yeah. The sign before downhill.

Q66   So - - -

A (Int):   First the sign then the downhill start.

Q67   So when you tried to reduce your speed from forty to twenty were you still driving on the flat or had you started going down the road, down the hill. MR ALALI Sorry, can you repeat that?

SERGEANT SAMUEL

Q68   When you were driving along doing forty you said you tried to reduce to twenty. Is that while you were still on flat or had you started to go downhill?

A (Int):   I was here before the downhill, just at the top, at the top, then the speed increased, started to increase slowly.”


	
	By this exchange Mr Nisan was saying that he had slowed to 40kph by the time he reached the black and white sign, but he was unable to slow to 20kph, by the time he reached the red 20kph speed sign.
	
	
	When asked what else he did to try and reduce his speed, Mr Nisan said:
	


“Q70   [19.13] And what else did you do to try and reduce the speed?

A (Int):   I'd pulled the handbrake and tried to check the gear. The gear was O.K. The truck continued. I can't remember what happened. I panicked.

Q71   Now, you said you attempted to reduce the speed and you realised there was a problem with the brake. How did you know there was a problem with the brake?

A (Int):   I was braking and nothing happened. It was obvious braking failure.

Q72   Now, when you were saying you were braking what was the feeling or sensation you got?

A (Int):   All my attempts pressing on the pedal of the brake, it's nothing happened, nothing happen or the, the, the speed is not slowing.

Q73   When you say there was nothing happening what was the brake pedal doing?

A (Int):   Despite the fact I am pressing on the brake as normal, but the speed, there is no change in the speed. The speed increasing despite the fact I am continuously pressing on the brake.

Q74   Did the brake pedal go to the floor?

A   Yeah.

A (Int):   Yes.

Q75   So every, are you saying that every time you pressed the brake it went to the floor?

A (Int):   Today?

Q76   Yes.

A (Int):   To the end. I ah, all my attempt is to stop that ah, the truck. To the end. To the, I tried more than once.

Q77   Then I think you said you tried the parking brake. What happened then?

A (Int):   At that time the speed started to increase. When I pulled the handbrake nothing happened. The speed wasn't affected. The truck continued.

Q78   Did you say then that the speed increased when you pulled the handbrake on?

A (Int):   It was all in a matter of seconds, seconds. I pulled the handbrake, the speed continued increasing.”


	
	As to the gear he was in, Mr Nisan said:
	


“Q79   And what gear were you in at the time?

A (Int):   One, low gear. Um, um, when I started I started on low gear, one.

Q80   [19.17] So when you started, before you went down the hill you were in first gear are you saying?

A (Int):   Before reaching the sign I started to go down with the gear, four, three, two, but I am sure at the top of the hill I went down to low gear, one. I tried to find a solution. I panicked. I tried to go number one. Nothing happened.”


	
	From this exchange Mr Nisan was saying that he had gone through the gears in low range from 4 down to 1, but he was not able to get into first gear.
	
	
	Signage was returned to after Mr Nisan said that he had noticed something was wrong with the air gauges. He then said:
	


“Q89   And where was this? Where were you on the roadway when that happened?

A (Int):   After the forty when I started, when I wanted to reduce the speed, before the sign when I started, I wanted to reduce the speed.

Q90   [19.21] And is that the sign up on the flat before you go down the hill?

A (Int):   Yes, flat, that's right.

Q91   Well, if you're still driving on the flat and you're only doing forty kilometres per hour why couldn't you stop the vehicle?

A (Int):   Oh, well, it was on forty. I attempted to go down to twenty then I realised something wrong with the gauge. I knew something was wrong with the brakes.

Q92   O.K. The twenty kilometre per hour speed limit which one are you referring to? Where is that situated?

A (Int):   What do you mean? Can you explain?

Q93   Well, you were saying that there are a number of signs going along Warringah Road and I think they warn a driver to slow to twenty.

A (Int):   Yes.

Q94   And where is that first sign that says twenty?

A (Int):   You mean the location? I can't understand.

Q95   Well, are you still driving along the flat when you have to move to twenty or are you going down the hill?

A (Int):   Can I, can l explain?

Q96   No. Sorry. I’m just, I’m just going to show you some pictures. Might be easier to explain.”


	
	In evidence at trial was a video recording of the drive down the road, past the signs, but that was not shown to Mr Nisan. Instead, he was then shown some photographs, with the signs numbered 1 to 4. After he said he recognised number 3, the first 20kph sign, he was asked:
	


“Q110   [19.27] O.K. Earlier you mentioned about changing gears or slowing down prior to the twenty K sign.

A (Int):   Yes, and here approximately the speed was around forty.

Q111   Around about forty. O.K.

A (Int):   I attempted, I, yes. I've tried to slow down to twenty but the truck didn't slow down.

Q112   O.K. So if I'm going to write here urn, forty Ks an hour at this point —

A (Int):   I cannot confirm —

Q113   O.K.

A   Exactly.

A (Int):   - - - at what point exactly.

Q114   O.K. When, do, do you know what this sign means?

A (Int):   Further down it'll be twenty. I can drive more than twenty after this sign, but when I, after the red no, definitely not. It should be twenty.

Q115   O.K. Do you know the speed limit on this road?

A (Int):   I'm not sure hundred percent. Seventy. It's ah, seventy, sixty but I'm not sure.”


	
	From this exchange, it is apparent that Mr Nisan was explaining that while he had attempted to reduce his speed before he reached the 20kph speed limit sign, he had been unable to do so and when he reached that sign, he was still travelling at 40kph.
	
	
	Mr Nisan was later asked again about the signs, by reference to a diagram and the photos at question 139. He then said that he was tired, exhausted, unable to remember exactly and was having trouble concentrating. He was given water and the interview continued. Later he was asked:
	


“SERGEANT SAMUEL

Q150   [19.39] I think earlier we were talking about the twenty kilometre truck and speed limit sign. Is this the one you're referring to in photograph 5?

A (Int):   Yeah, this is the last sign, yes. Must be twenty after this.

Q151   And do you agree that where this sign is the roadway is still flat?

A (Int):   The, the, the downhill start, the road start going down from the top from the first sign, slowly, slowly. This is not flat. Slowly, 'cause when you're driving the truck you can feel you start, start going down.

Q152   It's slightly is it?

A (Int):   Maybe you can see the ocean from the first traffic light. You can feel when you are driving the truck that it's not flat, slightly started going down.

A   Yeah, it's not, like, ah —

Q153   When, when you were driving down here where was your, your right foot?

A (Int):   Today?

Q154   Yes.

A (Int):   On the brake, I was trying on the brake.

Q155   Was it, was it still on the accelerator?

A (Int):   On the brake. No, no, on the brake.

Q156   O.K. And at that stage can you tell me, you might have already said, what gear you were in there?

A (Int):   l don't remember, when I started slowing down to forty, that's forty I was trying to reduce more and reaching this area here, down here the, the, the speed increased.

Q157    And had you tried to brake at that stage?

A (Int):    What stage?

Q158    When you went past this sign.

A (int):   Already I'd started, ah - - -

Q159   O.K.

A (Int)    - - - slowing down. The speed ah, went down to forty, but when I reached the downhill the speed started to increase up and up.”


	
	By this exchange, Mr Nisan was indicating that it was after he reached the 20kph speed limit sign, that his speed began to increase.
	
	
	Later, after he was taken to the signs again, Mr Nisan was asked what he understood the maximum speed in gear one low range was. He said that he thought it was up to 20kph, depending on the load and where the truck was travelling. Later he said that normally he drove down that incline in gear 3 and if the load was heavy, gear 2. Later Mr Nisan said that:
	


“Q170    [19.43] Could it have been that you were actually in fifth gear and not first gear?

A (Int):   … sure my finger is, you can feel it if it's on five, the truck will be lighter. I was certain, I was certain I went to down oh, to one. A, a, a truck driver can hear it from the sound, you know.

Q171   Yes. I realise that, but in the spur of the moment and you said it happened that quick, could you have actually been in fifth and not back to first?

A (Int)   I left the fifth before reaching that area because I started to slow down, went down with the gear.”


	
	Mr Nisan repeatedly said that it was very hard for him to remember exactly what had happened at different stages, because it had all happened in seconds. In his answer to question 190, he said that he could not remember if the exhaust brake had worked when he took his foot off the accelerator.
	
	
	In answering questions 193 and 194, he also said that he always had his foot on the brake on that hill, to make sure his speed did not go over 20kph and because someone could drive in front of him on that road. Mr Nisan was then asked:
	


“SERGEANT SAMUEL

Q196   If you're driving down in first gear wouldn't that also hold you back?

A (Int):   It does.

Q197   Because the truck can't do fifty or sixty kilometres in first gear obviously.

A (Int):   I tried, I attempted actually, I tried ah, to go on gear one, I, to make sure it's on one, but the speed didn't slow down. Increased.

Q198   So is it a case you might not have been in first gear?

A (Int):   …possibility it was on two, but when the downhill started, as I said, the, the, tried to slow down, I panicked when the truck didn’t slow down. I wanted to make sure if it was on low gear one.

Q199   So when you, you said you panicked, you could have been in second, could you have put the truck into neutral at that stage?

A (Int):   With the road going downhill … the speed would increase, go high ….”


	
	By this exchange Mr Nisan again agreed that he may not have succeeded in getting the truck into first gear.
	
	
	The Crown case on appeal was again that Mr Nisan was “very clear, both verbally and by his gestures”, that there were only two sets of signs on Warringah Hill. Further, that “by aiming to reduce his speed to 20kph by what was in reality the second set of mandatory speed limit signs, he … left it too late to reduce speed safely”.
	
	
	Neither of those conclusions were fairly open on what Mr Nisan said in the interview. Nor was the conclusion which the trial judge reached.
	
	
	In the result, while ground 2 must be dismissed, ground 4(a) must be upheld.
	


Ground 3 – unsafe, unsatisfactory or unreasonable verdict


	
	Mr Ruller’s opinion was that the collision had occurred because of Mr Nisan’s driving, not mechanical problems, because he had not attempted to slow the truck to 20kph early enough on the descent. Dr Hart concluded that the collision had occurred because the brakes were out of adjustment and had become so hot that they lost effectiveness – preventing Mr Nisan from slowing the truck, as he had planned, to 20kph, in order to descend the hill.
	
	
	Mr Nisan’s case on appeal was that the evidence, including various concessions made by Mr Ruller in cross-examination and the resulting findings which the trial judge made in the conviction judgment, her Honour ought to have entertained a doubt about his guilt of the charges of which he was convicted: Libke v The Queen (2007) 230 CLR 559; [2007] HCA 30 at [113]. The reasons given for rejecting Dr Hart's opinions did not follow as a matter of common sense, were illogical, unsafe, unreasonable and plainly absurd.
	
	
	Mr Nisan also contended that in circumstances where Dr Hart, a leading expert in heavy vehicle braking with the greater expertise, considerable caution had to be exercised in preferring Mr Ruller's reported opinions. Further, given Mr Ruller’s evidence in cross-examination, that if he knew that the brakes on the steer axle were in poor condition and in need of adjustment, he would not have taken the truck “out of the yard”, Dr Hart’s opinions should have been accepted.
	
	
	In the circumstances, in relation to what remained in dispute, Dr Hart's evidence should have been preferred, or at least led her Honour to the conclusion that there had to be a reasonable doubt as to Mr Nisan’s guilt of dangerous driving. Her Honour did not, as trial judge, enjoy an advantage from seeing and hearing the evidence, given at trial, which would preclude his appeal from being upheld: Filippou v The Queen at [12].
	
	
	On the Crown’s case Mr Nisan should not have used the brake at all on Warringah Hill, except perhaps in an emergency. The speed limit was 20kph and he should have driven in low gear, with the assistance of the exhaust brake.
	
	
	Accordingly, her Honour did not err in concluding that it was Mr Nisan’s manner of driving which had resulted in him exceeding the 20kph speed limit and causing the collision. As he descended the hill he was not only speeding, but driving in the incorrect gear; he had failed to use the exhaust brake; and he then attempted to use the handbrake, thereby depleting the air pressure of the footbrake system.
	
	
	The Crown also submitted that the fact that the truck was found to be in neutral at the scene of the collision, was likely to have been because Mr Nisan’s speed had been too high to permit the engine to allow him to reduce gears. This had also prevented engine retardation from limiting the speed of the truck.
	
	
	In my view the Crown’s case should not have succeeded at trial and Mr Nissan’s case must succeed on appeal.
	
	
	In evidence was:

	Mr Ruller’s third report, in which he responded to Dr Hart’s report.
	



	
	Neither Dr Hart nor Mr Ruller had inspected the truck.
	
	
	Other evidence established that non-genuine or ‘after market’ brake linings had been installed on the truck’s brakes. Their operation was not tested by either Constable Wilson or Dr White, to determine whether they met applicable vehicle standard regulations, or whether their operation could have contributed to the brakes failing. Dr Hart considered that they had contributed to the brakes overheating and fading.
	
	
	While the experts were all called separately to be cross-examined and did not give their evidence concurrently, as would have been of obvious assistance to the trial judge, some agreements emerged.
	
	
	For example, in cross-examination Mr Ruller confirmed that he agreed that the brakes on the steer axle were in poor condition and needed repair and that if he knew they were in that condition, he would not have driven the truck down Warringah Hill, or even taken it out of the yard. He also accepted that Mr Nisan may not have been aware of that problem, but in his view, he should have still been able to drive safely down the Hill, using normal driving procedures.
	
	
	On Dr Hart’s evidence, Mr Nisan needed to be in gear 5 or 6, to be driving the truck at 40kph. In his oral evidence Mr Ruller said that the truck would have needed to be in 5th gear.
	
	
	Mr Ruller agreed that the maximum speed for gear 5 was 40kph and that to go from 5th to 4th gear, Mr Nisan had to slow to the maximum speed of 29kph. When asked if the brakes should have been able to reduce the truck to that speed, Mr Ruller said that at the top of the hill, they should have “pulled him up”; that he could also slow his speed by taking his foot off the accelerator; that using the footbrake brake was an obvious way of reducing speed; and that:
	


“That's what I'm saying. If he had - looking at the 400 degrees at the top of the hill, had he hammered the brakes and tried to come to a stop at that point in time then I would say he probably could have pulled that vehicle up. It's going to take him an awful long time to do it.”


	
	In Dr Hart’s view, to achieve a speed of 20kph going down Warringah Hill, Mr Nisan had to shift down to gear 3. That is only possible if road speed and engine speed are suitable. In cross-examination Mr Ruller agreed that to shift down, the truck had to be put into low range. After the collision it was found to be in that range, but in neutral.
	
	
	Dr Hart said that if the speed was too high, an attempted gear change would fail, resulting in either a higher gear, or neutral being selected. Neutral would preclude engine retardation slowing the truck’s speed. The driver would then have to rely completely on the footbrake, because the exhaust brake only worked in gear. The handbrake would also not then be of assistance, because it used the same brake mechanism as the footbrake. Mr Ruller agreed.
	
	
	Dr Hart’s opinion was that the truck’s exhaust brake would probably be powerful enough to control the descent of the truck, if it was in gear 1 or 2, but not in higher gears. This would, however, require a speed of only 10kph at the top of the final descent. Otherwise, a driver would also have to use the footbrake while descending this hill.
	
	
	Mr Ruller said that the footbrake could have been ‘feathered’. Further, when he drove that route, he had observed another truck driver using both the exhaust brake and the footbrake.
	
	
	Dr Hart considered that Mr Nisan was mistaken, when he said that he had shifted down to low gear one, given that the truck was in neutral. Further, because the exhaust brake was off, he must not have understood what it did, as was also Mr Ruller’s opinion.
	
	
	In Dr Hart’s opinion, if these brakes had been adequate, the collision would not have occurred. Mr Nisan had a driving plan which should have resulted in him descending the final part of the hill at 20kph. That speed was rendered impossible because of brake fade, caused by the brakes having become excessively hot and having lost effectiveness. Mr Ruller agreed that there had been brake fade. What he doubted, however, was that Mr Nisan had applied the brakes before he reached the first 20kph speed sign.
	
	
	While the temperature of the brakes could not be established, the experts agreed that they overheated. Mr Cowie’s evidence was that when he went to the truck after the collision, he noticed a burning smell. On the voir dire Mr Ruller had agreed that the brakes being 400°F would explain the smell.
	
	
	Dr Hart explained that drum brakes fade more quickly when in poor adjustment, because braking effect is not shared equally, that also increasing the chance of all brakes experiencing fade, as brake linings reach extreme temperatures. This leads to a cascading effect, which causes brakes to fade sooner. Given the 55kph route Mr Nisan had travelled before the collision and the ‘after market’ brake linings which had been installed, Dr Hart considered that it was plausible that the brakes had reached extreme drum brake temperature. Dr Hart also said in his report:
	


“There is a fundamental condition in both Mr Ruller’s and Snr Constable Wilson’s opinions. They claim that the truck brakes were in acceptable adjustment, in good working condition and of adequate capacity. The truck was not overloaded. They discount any significant effect from brake fade. In these conditions the service brakes on the truck should then have been able to stop the truck on the Warringah Rd hill. I do not believe that Mr Nisan wanted to crash the truck and I do not believe that he failed to apply the footbrake. The only plausible explanation is that the brakes on the truck faded as he drove it down Warringah Rd. If as claimed the brakes were in good adjustment, then they should have been adequate to stop the truck without the exhaust brake and engine retardation.”


	
	In cross-examination Mr Ruller agreed with what Dr Hart said in this passage of his report, but still disagreed with Dr Hart about the point at which Mr Nisan applied the foot brake.
	
	
	Dr Hart disagreed with Mr Ruller's assumption that hot brakes had an effectiveness of 77% of cold brakes. On Dr Hart's evidence, if the brakes were as good as Mr Ruller said they were, they should have been capable of stopping the truck on the descent, notwithstanding that it was in neutral with the exhaust brake off.
	
	
	In cross-examination Mr Ruller agreed that the truck had a braking problem, or he said, Mr Nisan was trying to commit suicide.  He also agreed that poorly adjusted brakes were unsafe, because that would lengthen the stopping distance. Given that the truck was only doing 65kph at the time of the collision, he considered that the brakes had not failed completely and that brake fade had occurred only at the “later stages”. Dr Hart disagreed.
	
	
	From all of this evidence, I am satisfied that the Crown did not prove beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Nisan’s driving was dangerous, or that it caused the collision.
	
	
	The experts finally agreed that the truck’s footbrakes were defective. So defective that, in Mr Ruller’s view, the truck should not have been driven on the road at all. If the brakes had been properly adjusted, they should have been capable not only of slowing the truck down from 40kph, when Mr Nisan applied them after taking his foot off the accelerator, so that he could change gears in low range, on Mr Ruller’s evidence, they should have been able to bring the truck to a complete stop on the hill.
	
	
	The brakes did not achieve the deceleration necessary to permit Mr Nisan to effect the change into a lower gear, which he attempted. The result was that the truck was put into neutral and it accelerated, eventually to 65kph at the foot of the hill, where the collision occurred. In that situation, even if the exhaust brake had been on, it could not have operated to slow the truck’s speed while it was in neutral and travelling too quickly to permit a gear change. Mr Nisan said that he panicked when the brakes did not slow the truck and so he tried to use the handbrake, but that could be of no assistance to him, because of the way that the braking system operated.
	
	
	It follows that in using the foot brake as Mr Nisan said he did, to decelerate the truck while in it was in low range, so that he could change gears down, in order to descend Warringah Hill at the 20kph speed limit, he was not in breach of Road Rule 108. That Rule did not preclude Mr Nisan from using the foot brake to decelerate the truck, to permit such a gear change, before he reached the first speed sign. Rule 108 only required Mr Nisan to be driving at 20kph, when he reached the first 20kph speed limit sign and to drive at that speed until the 20kph zone ended.
	
	
	In that zone Mr Nisan had to drive in a gear low enough to limit the speed of the truck to that speed, without use of the foot brakes. The gear which would have limited the truck to that speed depended on the load which the truck was carrying that day. In order to put the truck into that gear, it had to be slowed. If the required slower speed could not be achieved by taking his foot off the accelerator, Mr Nissan had to use the truck’s foot brake, which should have been capable of bringing the truck to a stop.
	
	
	On his account, before he reached the speed sign Mr Nisan did take his foot off the accelerator, but that did not reduce the speed of the truck sufficiently so that he could change to a gear low enough, to allow it to descend the hill at 20kph. In that situation, considerations of safety undoubtedly required him to use the foot brake to reduce the speed of the truck, so that he could make such a gear change. That was what he attempted. His attempts failed, because the brakes faded.
	
	
	In that situation it cannot be considered that Mr Nisan’s use of the foot brake was dangerous. To the contrary, it was necessary. If properly adjusted, those brakes would have slowed the truck sufficiently to permit him to change gears down as he attempted. That they did not do so was because of the problems with the adjustment of the brakes which the experts identified.
	
	
	It follows that while the evidence established that the truck did not adhere to the 20kph speed limit, it did not establish beyond reasonable doubt that this was the result of Mr Nisan’s driving, rather than the state of the foot brakes. In the result, it could not be concluded that the Crown established beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Nisan’s s driving was dangerous, as her Honour finally concluded.
	
	
	This ground of appeal must accordingly be upheld, as must the conviction appeal.
	


Orders


	
	The orders I would make are:
	



	
	Leave to appeal be granted;
	
	
	The conviction appeal be upheld;
	
	
	The convictions be quashed; and
	
	
	The appellant should be released forthwith.
	



	
	CAMPBELL J:   I have had the considerable advantage of considering Schmidt J’s reasons in draft. I agree with the orders proposed for the reasons her Honour gives. I wish to record that having considered the evidence for myself I am of the view that notwithstanding the advantages enjoyed by the learned trial judge, for the reasons given by Schmidt J it was not open to her to convict the appellant.

		20 November 2017",2017-11-15 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
6497926,R v Read (No 2) [2017] NSWDC 323,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: It is a fundamental rule in sentencing that the sentence imposed on an offender reflect the objective gravity of that person’s conduct. That rule applies even in a case of powerful subjective features, and that rule explains the sentence that will ultimately impose upon the offender in this case.
	
	
	One sunny day in August 2013 the offender Steward Read was driving a prime mover with an unladen low loader behind him. He was travelling south along the Pacific Highway in an area where the speed limit was 110 kilometres per hour. His vehicle was limited to 100 kilometres per hour. He was travelling below that speed.
	
	
	Up ahead of him was a Roads and Maritime Services mowing operation which consisted of a tractor with a slasher attached doing the mowing and two associated warning vehicles between the tractor and vehicles approaching. Those two warning vehicles were highly visible, both being equipped with flashing lights and signs.
	
	
	Despite that circumstance the offender did not see the first warning vehicle at all and by the time he saw the second warning vehicle his only option was to swerve left, leaving the roadway. Unfortunately the tractor, with Mr Gary Hughes sitting on it, was directly ahead of him. The offender tried to steer his vehicle to the right to get back onto the roadway and miss the tractor but he was unsuccessful. His prime mover and the tractor collided. The tractor was destroyed and Mr Hughes was severely injured.
	
	
	As a result of this the accused faced trial on one charge of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm. The only issue in the trial was whether the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was driving dangerously. By their verdict the jury clearly found in favour of the Crown on that issue. Any other verdict would have been a surprise.
	
	
	The evidence established that the offender was not looking where he was going for something in the order of 21 seconds. In that time the offender approached and then drove past the first warning vehicle, a highly visible utility in which Mr Leith Newell was sitting, without even noticing it.
	
	
	That utility was parked by the side of the road. It had a trailer behind it on which was mounted a large sign indicating the left lane was closed and that vehicles should merge right. There was also an 80 kilometres per hour ahead sign. The utility itself was white with colourful stripes on its rear. The trailer was silver and yellow. The speed sign was of the standard appearance with black numerals surrounded by a red circle on a white background. The large sign was bordered in yellow, had a black background and had words spelt out on it in yellow lights.
	
	
	Despite all that, there is no doubt that the offender failed to see Mr Newell’s vehicle. A truck driver following closely behind the offender described how the offender drove his vehicle. He did not move to the right, as the sign on Mr Newell’s ute said he should do, nor did he decrease his speed from the 95 kilometres per hour at which he had been travelling.
	
	
	The offender then approached the second warning vehicle, described in the trial as a shadow vehicle. It too was highly visible with flashing lights and a large item known as an attenuator behind it. This is a structure designed to absorb impact. The truck had a large arrow board on top with flashing lights indicating that motorists should move to the right. There was an illuminated 80 kilometres per hour road work sign on the truck too and the rear of the truck itself was largely painted with bright red and yellow stripes. The attenuator had a large panel facing oncoming traffic with red and white chevrons painted on it.
	
	
	Despite these highly visible markings it appears that the accused only saw the shadow vehicle when he was about four seconds away from it, causing him to have to make the emergency steering move I have described above.
	
	
	What the evidence revealed was that the accused was not looking where he was going for a considerable period of time. At his trial Mr Bonnici of counsel, who does not appear on sentence, attempted to demonstrate a possible reason the accused was not looking where he was going as he approached the work site. Mr Bonnici suggested that it was reasonably possible, if not likely, that the offender was distracted by three Harley Davidson motorcycles passing him on his right. I do not find it necessary to decide whether that is what distracted the offender or whether it was, as he told police, that he had been looking at attractive female occupants of other vehicles on the road. Whatever it was that distracted the offender, it was clearly dangerous for him to not look where he was going for about 21 seconds.
	
	
	A great deal of the trial was taken up with evidence as to the adequacy of the traffic control plan put in place by Roads and Maritime Services for this mowing operation. An expert called by the Crown and an expert called by the defence both agreed that it was inadequate. There is no doubt that things could and probably should have been done better by the RMS. In one sense this collision may not have occurred if more adequate traffic control measures had been put in place. But the obvious must also be stated: the collision would not have occurred if the offender had been paying proper attention to the road ahead.
	
	
	An expert called on behalf of the offender at trial gave evidence that research suggests that drivers are only aware of things which are five to seven seconds down the road. The expert called by the Crown agreed with that opinion in normal circumstances but he, Mr George, questioned whether that researched applied to the situation faced by the offender on 28 August 2013. What was up ahead of him should have been visible to any attentive driver and gave plenty of time for that driver to respond to the warnings by changing lanes and slowing down.
	
	
	This was not a case of momentary inattention at all. This was a sustained piece of dangerous driving, dangerous because the offender was simply not looking where he was going for an extended period of time. The offender was driving a heavy vehicle which magnified the risks he posed to others on the road or nearby.
	
	
	Twenty-one seconds is not a “moment”. I recognise that the language in Court of Criminal Appeal decisions is not to be treated as though it was the language of a statute, but even so I have no doubt that the Court of Criminal Appeal in the guideline judgment of R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343; (2002) 55 NSWLR 252 never contemplated that a sustained piece of driving, where the driver was not looking where he was going for 21 seconds, could be a case of momentary inattention. I am fortified in this conclusion by a decision to which I have referred today; Kerr v The Queen [2016] NSWCCA 218.
	
	
	In deciding the sentence to impose upon the offender attention must of course be paid to the effect of the offence on the victim of it, Mr Gary Hughes. He has not provided a victim impact statement. I understand that he wishes to get on with his life. Evidence at trial was given as to his injuries, both in the form of evidence from Mr Hughes himself and also in a statement of agreed facts tendered to the jury.    From that I know that Mr Hughes had multiple broken ribs on both sides of his chest and a broken bone at the front of the chest that joins the ribs. The broken ribs caused injuries and bruising to both his lungs, he also had some bruising to his heart muscle. Due to the injuries to his lungs and ribs his chest cavity filled with air and blood, he had large tubes inserted into his chest cavity on both sides to drain the blood and air.
	
	
	He had an injury to his left lumbar artery which caused blood to collect in his pelvis, this artery was actively bleeding at the time and a wire was introduced under x‑ray guidance to block the bleeding from inside. Due to his chest injuries and blood lost he required intubation, he remained intubated for five days and when he was in the intensive care unit for seven days.
	
	
	He had fractures in his spine. They were of the L1 to L5 transverse processes. He also had a fracture of his collar bone, his elbow and two teeth. Glass was removed from his elbow during surgery and a laceration of his scalp was sutured. That was the evidence as to the treatment administered to Mr Hughes whilst in hospital.
	
	
	When he was called to give evidence it was clear that he had no memory of the collision and indeed said that he could not remember events up to a week before the collision. His first memory, he said, was probably about eight days after coming out of a coma. He was asked whether he had any ongoing problems, he said, “Yes, I’ve got brain damage basically. I’ve got problems with my leg or my left knee and my back”. When he was asked what he meant by problems he said, “They shoot pain. I still got a horrible knee. It just shoots pain basically”.
	
	
	These injuries, whilst of course not as significant as some injuries occasioned by victims of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm offences, were nevertheless serious. I am told that Mr Hughes has been able to return to work and so the injuries are clearly not such that they have prevented him from working, but I am able to find that the consequences to Mr Hughes of the offender’s dangerous driving are likely to be lengthy and serious, if not permanent.
	
	
	In common with many other offenders appearing for sentence for offences of this type Mr Read is a person of otherwise good character. He is now 41 years of age. He lives with his mother in Concord. He has a positive relationship with her. He had a positive relationship with his father until his father’s untimely death relatively shortly after the collision I have just described. He has an older sister who lives in country New South Wales, with whom he also has a positive relationship.
	
	
	Mr Read has a daughter. She lives with his ex-partner in the southern highlands. Mr Read’s mother gave evidence today about the positive relationship that Mr Read has with his ex-partner and how they cooperate in decisions concerning the welfare of their child.
	
	
	Mr Read left school in year 10 and completed a certificate 3 in heavy vehicle motor mechanics at TAFE. Since 2004 he has been employed as a driver or mechanic of heavy vehicles. He has been employed by his present employer for some 13 years. His employer, Mr Clark, gave evidence in support of his employee, the offender, today. He described him in exemplary terms. He has been a good worker, never late, taking his job seriously. He said that he could not fault him in any way. Mr Clark is obviously proud of his employees, including the offender, who deal with difficult driving jobs on a daily basis. He contrasted his employees with those who drive over‑height vehicles into tunnels, for example.
	
	
	Of course the offender’s criminal and driving record were tendered to me. They revealed an offence of dangerous driving in 1994 when the offender was a child, showing misconduct of a nature which apparently has not been repeated since he became an adult. There also a number of traffic infringement matters on his criminal history which have to be looked at in the light of the circumstance that he drives many more kilometres per year than the average driver. He has had three traffic infringement notices since this collision. Two were explained in evidence today. They did not reflect badly on the offender, resulting from what was apparently fleet-wide confusion as to the type of licence that was required for driving jobs people. Mr Clark seemed to accept responsibility for that confusion, indicating that he had paid Mr Read’s fines.
	
	
	Of course Mr Peluso of counsel who now appears for the offender paid attention to the guideline decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Whyte. Before looking at that guideline judgment in some detail, it is as well to remember why the very first guideline judgment handed down by the Court of Appeal, Jurisic v R (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 and its successor, Whyte v R, came about. Jurisic was a response by the Court of Criminal Appeal to a series of Crown appeals, usually successful, in which sentencing judges imposed excessively lenient sentences, probably as a result of the circumstance that offenders appearing for sentence for offences of that kind did not easily fit the description of “criminal”. They were, as this offender is, people of otherwise exemplary character who never intended to harm anyone else by their driving, but through dangerous misconduct on the roadway they have caused harm.
	
	
	Of course powerful subjective features cannot be allowed to overcome the need for a sentencing judge to impose a sentence which reflects the need for general deterrence in a case of this kind. Road users, even those who do not easily fit the description of being a criminal, need to be made aware that they are involved in a dangerous activity, that they need to pay attention to what they are doing, and that they cannot allow themselves to be distracted for a period of up to 21 seconds. Such circumstances of course apply even more so when the person doing the driving is in charge of a heavy vehicle where the consequences of a collision are usually much more serious.
	
	
	Many of the commonly recurring features identified in Whyte apply to this case. Obviously one does not, there was not a plea of guilty in this matter. Another commonly referred to feature concerned remorse displayed by the offender. I have no doubt that the offender has been deeply affected by the consequences for Mr Hughes of the collision. But I have my doubts as to whether the offender is truly as accepting of his own responsibility for those injuries, as he should be.
	
	
	In the pre-sentence report, this appears:
	


“Mr Read agreed with the police facts, however during the interview process he asserted that there were other contributing factors which he believes contributed to the accident, namely the warning signs did not provide him sufficient distance to stop.”


	
	Mr Read confirmed that that was his belief in evidence today. I have to say that Mr Read’s attitude is wrong. The warning signs were visible from some distance away. Had he been paying attention to the road on which he was travelling, he would have seen them. It is remarkable that Mr Read drove past Mr Newell’s utility with its trailer attached without even noticing it. The warning signs, contrary to what Mr Read asserts, did provide him with sufficient distance to stop.
	
	
	I do not want to minimise however the effect of this collision on the offender himself. The psychological report speaks of the consequences for him of the events of that day. He is, according to the psychologist, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. It would be a rare person who has injured another person significantly through their dangerous driving who does not reflect constantly on the consequences of that driving for the injured person. However, this offender, Mr Read himself, appears to have taken matters to heart more than most. I accept that in many senses he has already suffered because of his misconduct. In Mr Read’s case the consequences for him were exacerbated by the untimely death of his father shortly after the collision.
	
	
	Of course one consequence for the offender will be that he loses his licence for a period of time. Ordinarily, as a truck driver, that would mean that he loses his job. Mr Clark generously and, as a reflection of how well he regards Mr Read as an employee, will keep the offender on as a mechanic although his income will probably halve as a result of him losing his licence.
	
	
	There will be other consequences too of course, it will be harder for the offender to visit his daughter. There will be consequences too if the offender is imprisoned. The offender’s mother suffers from a condition whereby she cannot drive lengthy distances. As I mentioned, the offender’s sister lives in country New South Wales so the offender’s mother will suffer should the offender go to gaol. The offender’s daughter will suffer as well. But the hardship to these people is not exceptional. I will nevertheless take it into account as part of the general mix of subjective features in the offender’s favour.
	
	
	I have determined the length of the sentence to impose upon the offender. It is such that an intensive corrections order is an available sentencing option. Mr Peluso impressed upon me an outcome which would involve me obtaining a report as to the suitability for the offender to serve his sentence through that means. I have given serious consideration of course to Mr Peluso’s submission, but I have ultimately rejected it. I have done so for two particular reasons. The first is the authorities which bind me, in particular the guideline judgment of Whyte, and the second is the need to reflect in a very positive way the principle of general deterrence. Other truck drivers who are behind the wheel for hours at a time must know that if they allow themselves to be distracted, whether it is by attractive women in other cars, Harley-Davidson motor bikes overtaking them, or any other reason whatsoever, and as a result of such distraction they cause serious injuries to another road user, then significant punishment will result.
	
	
	I recognise that the offender will pay a heavy price for his manner of driving, but in my view that is necessary, as I began these remarks on sentence, to reflect the objective gravity of his offending.
	
	
	I will disqualify the offender from driving for a period of two and a half years from today. I impose a sentence of imprisonment consisting a non-parole period of nine months and a head sentence of 18 months to date from today. The non-parole period will expire on 5 July 2018 on which day the offender is to be released to parole.

Introduction 

Rolf Harris 

This  is  a  renewed  application  for  leave  to  appeal  against  conviction  and  a  long 
extension of time in which to do so.  Since the allegations are of a sexual nature, the 
provisions  of  the  Sexual  Offences  (Amendment)  Act  1992  apply  so  that  the 
complainants are entitled to anonymity. 

The applicant was convicted after a trial at Southwark Crown Court on 30 June 2014 
of  12  counts  of indecent  assault,  contrary  to  s.14  of the Sexual  Offences  Act  1956.  
Those convictions related to four different victims: WR (Count 1); GP (Count 2); JH 
(Counts  3  to  9);  and  TL  (Counts  10  to  12).    On  4  July  2014  the  applicant  was 
sentenced to a total of five years and nine months’ imprisonment.  That has now been 
served. 

Following that trial there was an application for leave to appeal against conviction in 
November 2014.  Those grounds  are not  pursued in this application.  The applicant 
now seeks to advance further grounds of appeal settled by new counsel.  At the heart 
of this renewed application is an application to introduce fresh evidence which, it is 
submitted, undermines the credibility of two of the complainants, namely, WR (Count 
1)  and  TL  (Counts  10  to  12).    In  addition,  however,  it  is  contended  that  if  the 
convictions in respect of either complainant are found to be unsafe, either because of 
fresh  evidence  or  additionally  in  the  case  of  Counts  10  to  12  by  reason  of  lack  of 
disclosure,  the  convictions  on  the remaining  counts  concerning  GP  and  JH  are also 
unsafe  given  the  terms  of  the  Judge’s  directions  in  summing  up  as  to  cross-
admissibility. 

After  the  2014  trial  the  applicant  earlier  this  year  faced  a  further  indictment 
containing different allegations of indecent assault against seven other complainants.  
In February 2017 he was acquitted of four counts, with the jury being discharged on 
the remaining counts after failing to agree.  A further trial was held, ending in May 
2017 with a jury disagreement.  The prosecution did not seek a further retrial and not 
guilty  verdicts  were  entered  on  the  outstanding  counts.    That  matter  is  of  relevance 
because  transcripts  are  available  from  the  February  2017  proceedings  of  evidence 
given by witnesses now put forward in the fresh evidence application.  In the case of 
three such witnesses, Raymond Piper, Peter Spencer and JW the court has heard oral 
evidence de bene esse.

The  appellant 
in  children’s 
entertainment.    He  came  to  this  country  from  Australia  in  the  1950s  and  became 
successful.    The  Crown’s  case  was  that  he  used  his  celebrity  status  to  abuse  young 
women  and  children  sexually.    It  was  alleged  that  between  1969  and  1986  he 
committed 12 offences of indecent assault against the four complainants named in the 
indictment.    Those  offences  took  place  in  this  country.    It  was  also  alleged  that  in 
1978/9 he had sexually assaulted JH (then aged 13) outside the jurisdiction and that 
between  1969  and  1991  he  committed  indecent  assaults  upon  other  young  females 
outside  the  jurisdiction  which  were  not  reflected  in  the  indictment  but  which  were 
introduced as bad character evidence.

Part  of  the  Crown’s  case  was  that  the  evidence  of  the  complainants  named  on  the 
indictment was cross-admissible.   Its case was that there were telling similarities in 
the accounts of the four complainants and also in the accounts of complainants whose 
accounts were admitted as bad character evidence.  The jury was provided with a list 
of similarities in a “schedule of potential relevance”.   

The defence case on all counts was one of denial.  In relation to the complainants WR 
(Count1), GP (Count 2) and TL (Counts 10 to 12) their accounts were untruthful or 
mistaken.  The applicant denied ever meeting WR.  Any contact with any of them at 
the material time was entirely innocent.  There was no significance in any similarities 
between the alleged assaults. 

As far as JH (Counts 3 to 9) was concerned, the defence case was that the applicant 
had had a consensual sexual relationship with her but that it did not begin until she 
was 18.  Allegations of earlier sexual contact were untrue. 

The  defence  also  maintained  that  due  to  the  passage  of time it  was  difficult  for the 
applicant to recall with precision his movements or attendance at specific events.  It 
was said that contemporaneous records which might have assisted in that respect were 
no longer in existence and that there had been difficulties in identifying and tracing 
potential witnesses.  All of these matters were alluded to in the summing up. 

Waiver of Privilege 

10. 

The applicant signed a limited waiver of privilege and John Harding (a solicitor) and 
Simon Ray (junior trial counsel) provided statements regarding the extent of enquiries 
carried out prior to trial in relation to the allegations made by WR and TL, as well as 
in relation to the reading of Ms Loughlin’s statement and related issues. 

Ground 1 - Count 1 (WR) – The Evidence at Trial 

11. 

The  allegation  was  one  of  indecent  assault  by  touching  WR’s  vagina  over  her 
clothing.  This occurred in 1969 when WR was aged 7 or 8 and had attended an event 
at the Leigh Park Community Centre in Portsmouth.  We set out the evidence relied 
on by the Crown in the following paragraphs. 

12.  WR placed the incident  in 1969 by  reference to  television reports of the  first moon 
landings and the applicant’s song “Two Little Boys” being in the pop charts.  It was 
agreed that the song was released in the autumn of 1969.  WR said she went to the 
event with her older brother and possibly her older sister.  She recalled the applicant 
performing the song on stage and signing autographs.  After he signed an autograph 
for her, the applicant had put his hand between her legs, touching her twice over her 
clothing.  On the second occasion it was done forcefully and aggressively.  She said 
that  the  applicant  had  big  hairy  hands.    Although  she  had  told  the  police  that  she 
might have told her brother and sister, her recollection was that she had not.  She had 
not told her mother, who was unwell at the time.  She had married in the early 1980s 
and  told  her  husband  about  the  incident  after  they  had  their  first  child.    She  had 
reported the matter to police in May 2013.  She said she had nothing to gain from this 
apart from closure.

13.  WR’s husband said that WR, prompted by seeing the applicant on television, had told 
him  early  in  their  relationship  that  the  applicant had  indecently  assaulted  her.    This 
was well before any revelations concerning Jimmy Savile. He could not recall the date 
or details, beyond saying that she had mentioned it on about four occasions, and that 
the first mention was prior to the birth of their first child. 

14. 

Karen Dix, a Family Support Officer, had seen WR in 2012, before Jimmy Savile was 
exposed, and had been told by her that when she was aged about 7, and at a festival or 
similar event when living in Leigh Park, the applicant had put his hand up her skirt 
from  behind and into her knickers.  She thought WR had said that she had told her 
parents  but  that  they  didn’t  believe  her  or  were  dismissive.    In  April  2013  WR 
mentioned  the  matter  again,  saying  she  now felt  sufficiently  confident  to  report  the 
matter to police. 

15.  WR’s older brother confirmed that he used to take his sisters to the community centre 
on Saturdays.  He did not recall the applicant having visited the centre and said that 
WR did not tell him that she had been sexually assaulted. 

16.  WR’s  sister  said  she  did  not  recall  attending  the  community  centre  for  the  event 
described,  but  that  did  not  mean  it  had  not  happened.    She  did  not  recall  WR 
mentioning an indecent assault by the applicant and said that she would recall it if had 
been mentioned.   

17.  WR’s mother, MW, said that the family had moved to Leigh Park in September 1969.  
She  remembered  the  children  going  to  the  community  centre  on  a  regular  basis  on 
Thursday and Saturday afternoons.  All of the above witnesses’ statements were read, 
with the exception of WR.   

18. 

19. 

20. 

David James gave evidence saying he had lived  in  Leigh Park for many  years.   He 
was on a large period of leave having come back from a long tour of duty in Korea at 
the time of a visit by the applicant to the centre.  He recalled that in about 1967 the 
applicant opened a nearby shop and was invited to the community centre afterwards.  
He  said  he  had  met  the  applicant  and  may  have  got  his  autograph  for  his  young 
children.  He said that the visit was not in 1978 or later when his children would have 
been older.  Nor had he confused the applicant with other celebrities who had visited 
the centre.  

Phillip  Willbourn  gave  evidence  that  he  lived  and  went  to  school  in  the  area  until 
moving  away  in  about  1977  when  he  was  aged  20.    He  recalled  that  the  applicant 
visited  the  area  in  the  late  1960s.    He  had  heard  about  it  rather  than  seeing  him  in 
person.  He denied that he was mistaken or confusing a later visit to the area by the 
applicant in 1978 or in the 1980s. 

Detective  Sergeant  Pankhurst  accepted  that  the  applicant  had  a  high  profile  in  the 
1960s and that it might have been expected that a visit to the community centre would 
have been mentioned in the media.  He said that despite extensive research no reports 
had been found placing the applicant in the Portsmouth area between 1967 and mid-
1974.    House-to-house  enquiries  in  the  locality  had  failed  to  lead  to  any  other 
witnesses who recalled any celebrities visiting the area during that time.

Certain agreed facts were put before the jury:

Rolf Harris 

The  Metropolitan  Police 

“24. 
checked  Portsmouth 
newspapers between April 1968 and May 1970.  No trace was 
found  of  the  event  at  the  Leigh  Park  Community  Centre 
described by WR.  The police action recorded that ‘all relevant 
lines were exhausted and no media available.’ 

25. 
A police investigator attended Portsmouth Library and 
the British Library to examine archived editions of ‘The News’ 
Portsmouth,  published  between  January  1967  and  May  1974.  
He found no reference to Rolf Harris. 

The  Metropolitan  Police  issued  a  witness  appeal  to 
26. 
anyone  who  attended  Leigh  Park  Community  Centre  between 
1968  and  1972  as  either  a  child  or  an  adult  asking  if  anyone 
knew  of  any  events  held  at  the  community  centre  during  this 
time.    A  letter  was  delivered  to  surrounding  roads  on  the 
housing estate. 

Between  12  March  2014  and  31  March  2014  the 
27. 
Metropolitan  Police  conducted  enquiries  in  the  vicinity  of 
Leigh  Park,  Havant,  Portsmouth.    The  investigator  stated  that 
the enquiries were intended ‘to ascertain if any residents could 
recall the subject of Rolf Harris being in the area during the late 
1960s or 1970s’ but, ‘no persons were able to assist’.” 

22. 

23. 

In addition to the summarised evidence, the Crown relied on an alleged lie told by the 
applicant in relation to Count 2 in asserting that he had never been to Cambridge prior 
to 2010/11.  This alleged lie was relied on as supporting WR’s evidence on Count 1 
that the applicant had attended the community centre despite his assertion that he had 
never been there. 

The defence case on this count was that WR  was lying or mistaken in  her account.  
About 15 years had passed between the alleged incident and her first telling anyone 
about it.  She may genuinely but mistakenly have persuaded herself that the applicant 
was the person responsible.  There was no record, despite very extensive enquiries, of 
him having visited the community centre in the late 1960s.  In summing up, the judge 
directed the jury that they must be sure that WR had correctly identified the applicant 
as the person who had assaulted her.   

24.  We next set out evidence relied on for the defence.  The applicant denied ever going 
to the community centre, let alone meeting WR.  He said he did not have big hairy 
hands. 

John  Tabbener  said  he  had  lived  near  to  the  community  centre  except  for  a  period 
between  1964  and  1967.    His  family  were  closely  involved  with  the  centre  and  he 
would expect to have heard had the applicant ever visited.  He would have been in his 
mid-20s at the time and had no knowledge of any such visit. 

Lorna Madden, the applicant’s solicitor, provided a witness statement stating that she 
had  attended  Portsmouth  Central  Library  and  reviewed  local  newspapers  for  the 
period 1968-1970.  Based on her research she said that the appearance of any notable

individual  at  the  community  centre  would  have  been  announced  in  the  Portsmouth 
Telegraph.    She  had  found  no  reference  to  the  applicant  attending  the  venue.    Ms 
Madden did not give evidence but her statement was used to obtain the admissions set 
out above along with further admissions confirming her findings from the officer in 
the case.     

Fresh Evidence – Count 1 

27.  We received evidence from a number of witnesses on a provisional basis.  JW, WR’s 
stepfather,  gave  oral  evidence  to  the  effect  that  the  children,  and  WR  in  particular, 
would  not  have  been  allowed  to  go  to  the  community  centre  unaccompanied.    He 
knew  of  no  meeting  between  WR  and  the  applicant.    He  also  said  he  had  told  the 
police  prior  to  the  first  trial  that,  as  a  local  door-to-door  tradesman,  he  had  never 
heard  of  the  applicant  attending  the  community  centre,  but  that  they  had  not  been 
interested in taking a statement from him. 

Raymond  Piper  was  a  former  police officer  who  had  risen  to  the  rank  of Detective 
Superintendent.  He had been stationed at Leigh Park between 1968 and 1971 in close 
proximity to the community centre.  He said he had visited the centre almost daily and 
said  that  the  applicant  had  never  attended.    He  said  he  would  have  known  about  it 
from  posters  or  being  informed  by  staff.    He  accepted  it  was  possible  the applicant 
had visited the centre without his knowledge, but thought it unlikely.     

Peter  Spencer  was  another  former  police  officer  who  had  retired  with  the  rank  of 
Sergeant.  He had been stationed at Leigh Park in 1969 and attended the centre almost 
daily  for CID  briefings  over coffee.    He  said  that  the applicant  had  not  been  to  the 
centre for the same reasons as given by Mr Piper, but accepted that he had a lack of 
interest in who appeared there and that the applicant might have appeared without him 
noticing.  The tenor of his evidence was that he did not believe that the applicant had 
visited the centre. 

In  addition  to  those  witnesses  who  gave  evidence  orally  we  have  read  a  statement 
from Joyce Burrows.  She was a local resident heavily involved with the centre at the 
relevant time, as were her family.  Her brother John Tabbener gave evidence for the 
defence at the trial (see above).  In 1969 she had had a Saturday job at a supermarket 
near the centre.  She did not recall that the applicant had attended the centre at any 
point.  It was possible that there had been a visit, but as far as she knew, he did not 
visit. 

Bruna  Zanelli  was  a  personal  assistant  to  the  applicant  at  the  relevant  time.    Her 
written statement shows that she would not have booked him to attend an event at the 
community centre and that he would not have promoted “Two Little Boys” at such a 
venue.    At  that  time  it  was  being  promoted  on  Top  of  the  Pops  and  other  similar 
television programmes.  She also thought it very unlikely that he would have agreed, 
impromptu, to visit a community centre after opening a shop. 

Daphne James was the ex-wife of David James who had been called as a prosecution 
witness  (see  above).    She  said  he  never  went  to  Korea  as  a  serviceman  as  he  had 
claimed in a witness statement (but not in evidence).  He was in fact a long-distance 
lorry driver who was in the Territorial Army but had never served abroad.  She also 
said  that  she  would  have  known  if  he  had  got  the  applicant’s  autograph  for  their

children,  and  he  had  not.    Whenever  he  went  to  the  community  centre  she  always 
went  with  him.    She  had  never  heard  of  the  applicant  going  there  or  of  Mr  James 
meeting him.  She had lived in the Leigh Park area for most of the time since the late 
1930s.    As  set  out  at  below,  information  has  now  come  to  light  about  Mr  James’ 
antecedents. 

All  of  these witnesses  gave evidence  at  the  applicant’s  trial  on  different  allegations 
early  in  2017.    Their  evidence  was  adduced  pursuant  to  s.74(3)  of  the  Police  and 
Criminal Evidence Act 1984 in rebuttal of the applicant’s convictions at the first trial 
having  been  adduced  as  bad  character  evidence.    This  evidence  was  called  by  the 
applicant  in  seeking  to  discharge  the  burden  upon  him  to  prove  that  he  had  not 
committed the offences presently before the court.  It is relied on afresh before us.  In 
each  such  case  we have  read  transcripts  of the  witnesses’  evidence  given  at  trial  in 
2017, in addition to witness statements and/or oral evidence placed before this court. 

For  the  defence,  it  was  contended  that  the  combined  effect  of  this  fresh  evidence, 
when assessed with the evidence given in relation to Count 1, was to cast extremely 
serious  doubt  on  the  proposition  that  either  the  complainant  or  the  applicant  had 
attended the centre in 1969, let alone as alleged by WR.  The only direct evidence to 
that effect, apart from WR, came from David James.  Philip Willborn’s evidence was 
secondary.  This fresh evidence would have had a significant impact on the minds of a 
jury, which is a legitimate method of testing the safety of the conviction.  The only 
rational conclusion to be drawn is that the applicant is innocent of the allegation. 

On behalf of the Crown it was contended that this material did not affect the safety of 
the conviction.  In response to the fresh evidence proffered from JW, WR’s stepfather, 
the  prosecution  relied  on  rebuttal  evidence  given  at  the  first  2017  trial  from  D.C. 
Atkin who had seen JW in 2013 prior to the initial trial.  D.C. Atkin was called before 
us.  He disputed JW’s account of events, saying that no witness statement had been 
taken from JW since he could not add anything to that which his wife MW had said.  
The  contact  with  JW  was  recorded  and  included  in  a  schedule  of  unused  material.  
D.C. Atkin refuted the assertion by JW in evidence in 2017 that he or another officer 
had told JW that they had a witness who could place the applicant at Leigh Park.  He 
pointed out that at the date of the visit to JW the police had no witness other than WR 
who positively put  the applicant at  Leigh Park.  The statement of David James was 
not obtained until 23 October 2013, by different officers, some 10 days later.  He had 
only  been  identified  as  a  witness  on  18  October.    We  were  shown  documentation 
confirming this.   

The Crown’s overall submission was that the fresh material did not add anything of 
significance  to  the  evidence  before  the  trial  jury  which  indicated  that,  save  for WR 
and  David  James,  extensive  research  could  not  identify  anyone  who  recalled  the 
applicant attending the centre.  The evidence from the two retired police officers was 
simply further evidence  within a category that had already been adduced before the 
jury and should not be received.  Similar submissions were made in relation to Joyce 
Burrows.  It was clear that she had been specifically considered as a potential witness 
by the defence at the time of the trial and a decision had been made not to call  her 
because the defence “felt we had enough material to undermine [WR’s] allegations”. 

37. 

In relation to the evidence of Ms Zanelli, the Crown submitted that there was no good 
reason as to why her evidence could not have been called at trial.  It was clear from
--------

Rolf Harris 

his  former  solicitors  that  they  had  made  extensive  enquiries  as  to  the  applicant’s 
movements at the relevant time and had spoken to those who provided services and 
support to the applicant.  Moreover, if David James’ account of a possibly impromptu 
visit to the centre was correct, the applicant himself was in a position to give evidence 
as  to  whether  or  not  he  would  have  done  something  like  that.    In  any  event,  this 
evidence added little to the previous body of evidence. 

Turning  to  JW,  at  trial  it  was  clear  to  the  defence  from  the  statements  of  WR’s 
mother,  MR,  and  her  two  siblings  that  JW  was  a  potential  witness.    Indeed,  he  is 
referred to in statements from two of those three witnesses.  His name also featured in 
a disclosure schedule which recorded that he had no information to add to that which 
was contained in his wife’s statement.  The previous defence team had not approached 
JW, perhaps influenced by that entry, but in any event they had made clear that they 
felt  they  had  sufficient  evidence  to  undermine  WR’s  allegation  of  presence  at  the 
centre.  Much of what JW had to say duplicated evidence already given.  Insofar as he 
went  beyond  that,  the  evidence  of  D.C.  Atkin  tended  to  rebut  that  given  by  JW.  
Accordingly, his evidence should not be received.   

As  we  have  noted,  David  James  was  the  only  person  other  than  WR  who  gave 
evidence about Rolf Harris attending the community centre.  The Crown accepts that 
the evidence now put forward by Daphne James potentially undermines his reliability 
and credibility.  He claimed at trial to be able to date the applicant’s appearance at the 
centre  to  about  1967  by  reference  to  having  been  on  leave  following  return  from  a 
long tour of duty in Korea.  That might have been thought to be somewhat odd since 
the Korean War took place in the early 1950s.   

It appears, after waiver of privilege, that the defence team did not take steps to trace 
members  of  David  James’  family.    They  were  of  the  view  that  they  had  sufficient 
material to undermine WR and did not feel that further enquiries were necessary.   

Prior  to  the  first  trial  the  prosecution  did  not  disclose  that  Mr  James  had  previous 
convictions and that he had been discharged from the RAF on medical grounds after a 
matter of weeks.  D.C. Atkin made a statement early in 2017 setting out steps taken 
prior to discovering a microfiche relating to David James before the 2017 proceedings 
showing details of convictions for three minor offences of dishonesty (all resulting in 
fines) in the period 1962 to 1968, and recording discharge from National Service after 
10 days for unsatisfactory performance. 

The  same  information  also  revealed  that  Mr  James  had  worked  as  a  haulage  driver 
between  1963  and  1969.    Indeed,  one  of  his  convictions  concerned  dishonestly 
obtaining just over £1 from his employer by falsely altering a receipt.   

The  Crown  submitted  that  whilst  the  new  information  might  potentially  undermine 
David James’ credibility, in reality it was unlikely to have altered the view taken by 
the  applicant’s  previous  legal  team  that  further  enquiries  were  unnecessary.    We 
record  that  Mr  James  has  died  and  so  was  not  available  to  comment  in  these 
proceedings.

Overall,  the  Crown’s  submission  was  that  whether  all  or  any  of  the  fresh  evidence 
was received, it did not operate to render the conviction on Count 1 unsafe.

The Law 

Rolf Harris 

45. 

46. 

The receipt of fresh evidence by this court is governed by s.23 of the Criminal Appeal 
Act  1968.    The  primary  consideration  is  the  interests  of  justice,  but  sub-section  (2) 
sets  out  a  number  of  matters  to  which  the  court  should  have  regard  in  considering 
whether  to  receive  any  evidence.    Those  matters  include  consideration  of  the 
credibility of the evidence, whether the evidence may afford a ground for allowing the 
appeal and whether there is a reasonable explanation for not calling the evidence at 
the original trial. 

As to the court’s approach to any fresh evidence received, or any other matter raised 
before  the  court,  it  was  common  ground  that  the  test  for  the  court  was  whether 
convictions  were  safe,  notwithstanding  matters  raised  before  us.    In  the  absence  of 
controversy, there is no need to develop these matters further.     

Discussion of Ground 1 

47. 

It  seemed  to  us  that  by  the  far  the  most  cogent  evidence  presented  to  us  related  to 
David James.  That evidence came from his antecedents, revealed for the first time, as 
confirmed by the evidence of his wife Daphne James.  We have already commented 
on the oddity that nobody  at trial picked up on the reference made by Mr James to 
being on leave from a tour of duty in Korea, notwithstanding the ending of the war 
there about a decade and a half prior to 1969.  Be that as it may, the belated disclosure 
of Mr James’ antecedents shows that what was an apparent peculiarity on the face of 
his statement is transformed into something rather more significant.  The information 
now available about his military service and employment history tends to suggest that 
his account of recent service in Korea was a fantasy.  Mr Rees QC, for the Crown, 
rightly  accepted  that  the  primary  duty  in  investigating  its  witness’s  antecedents  lies 
with the Crown.  For some reason, at the time of trial the necessary checks had not 
been  made  or  had  not  properly  been  made  as  the  subsequent  investigation  by  D.C. 
Atkin showed.  The relevant information was available to be found and disclosed, but 
that did not happen.

In our judgment, this was a significant failing.  If the material had been obtained and 
disclosed at the correct time it is very doubtful that Mr James would have been called 
as  a  witness.    If  he  had  been  called  to  give  evidence,  his  credibility  would  have 
suffered devastating damage.  The fact of his  minor criminal convictions would not 
have made  any material  difference since Mr James had not re-offended since 1968, 
but the exposure of the truth about his military service and employment history would 
have been of great significance. 

49.  Mr James was a very important witness on Count 1.  He was the only person, apart 
from  WR,  to  confirm  a  visit  by  Rolf  Harris  to  the  centre  at  the  relevant  time.    He 
confirmed  the  event  described  by  WR  and  his  evidence  had  emerged  after a  public 
appeal  for  witnesses  so  that  he  would  have  appeared  to  be  independent  and 
disinterested.  His evidence was also significant because the account given suggested 
an impromptu visit to the centre by Mr Harris.  This enabled the Crown to counteract 
defence reliance on the absence of reports of a visit in the media.  There was some 
minor  other  supporting  evidence  from  Mr  Willbourn,  but  it  was  hearsay  and 
somewhat vague.  If Mr James is removed from the picture, WR is left on her own in

asserting  an  encounter  with  Mr  Harris  at  the  community  centre  in  circumstances 
where there was a body of evidence to the contrary. 

It is plain to us that it is in the interests of justice that we should receive the evidence 
of Daphne James and the antecedents of David James.  In our view, this operates to 
weaken the Crown’s case on the important issue of whether Rolf Harris ever attended 
the  community  centre  in  1969  to  the  extent  that  we  cannot  view  the  conviction  on 
Count 1 as safe.  The remaining evidence of WR herself, taken together with evidence 
of her complaints to others prior to the exposure of Jimmy Savile, is insufficient  to 
give us the necessary degree of confidence in the verdict on Count 1. 

That conclusion is sufficient to dispose of the fresh evidence adduced in relation to 
Count 1, but we think it right to deal with the other evidence we heard or read.   

Joyce  Burrows  was  not  heavily  relied  on  by  Mr  Vullo  QC.    Her  evidence  was 
available  at  the  time  of  trial  and  a  decision  was  made  not  to  call  her.    In  those 
circumstances, it would be an unusual case in which she could now be relied on.  We 
see no basis for doing so and decline to receive her evidence. 

Bruna  Zanelli  did  not  in  our  view  add  materially  to  evidence  which  was  already 
before  the  jury.    Her  evidence  faces  the  additional  difficulty  that,  given  her  role  as 
diary  keeper  for  Mr  Harris,  it  is  hard  to  see  that  there  could  be  a  reasonable 
explanation for failure to call her.  We decline to receive her evidence. 

As to the former police officers Piper and Spencer, we say at once that they struck us 
as honest witnesses who had been in the vicinity at the relevant time and who did not 
believe  that  a  visit  by  the  applicant  to  the  centre  would  have  escaped  their  notice.  
However,  there  was  already  a  significant  body  of  evidence  before  the  jury,  calling 
into question whether the applicant had visited the centre.  We do not consider that the 
evidence  of  these  witnesses  changes  that  picture  and  we  decline  to  receive  the 
evidence.   

JW was a witness heavily relied on by Mr Vullo.  There were two particular matters 
which  emerged  from  his  account.    Firstly,  that  at  that  time  his  children  were  not 
permitted to visit the centre unaccompanied, and secondly, that as a local tradesman 
he  had  no  knowledge  of  a  visit  by  Rolf  Harris.    As  to  that  second  point,  his 
information does not add to what was already before the jury.  As to the first point, 
having considered the statements given by other members of his family and evidence 
given  by  D.C.  Atkin,  we  are  unconvinced  about  the  reliability  of  JW’s  assertion, 
although  we  accept  his  honesty.    More  significantly  perhaps,  we  consider  that  his 
reliability  is  seriously  undermined  by  his  insistence  that  police  officers  in  October 
2013  told  him  that  they  had  another  witness  who  could  place  Rolf  Harris  at  the 
community centre.  Having heard from D.C. Atkin, who contradicted that assertion, 
we are  satisfied  that  JW  is  mistaken  in  his  recollection  and  have  seen  documentary 
evidence  which  clearly  supports  that  conclusion.    For  these  reasons,  we  decline  to 
receive the evidence of JW. 

Conclusion on Ground 1
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 
 

Rolf Harris 

56. 

In the light of our finding in relation to David James’ evidence, we give leave and the 
necessary extension of time in relation to Ground 1.  For the reasons given above, we 
conclude that the conviction on that count is unsafe.   

Grounds 2 and 2A - Counts 10 to 12 (TL) 

TL grew up in Australia.  In 1986 when she was 15 she travelled to the UK with a 
theatre  group.    Following  its  final  performance  on  31  May  1986  the  group  met  the 
applicant in a public house.  It was alleged that whilst there TL sat on the applicant’s 
knee  and  he  touched  her  upper  leg  and  vagina  (Count  10),  and  that  outside  the 
lavatory he touched her breasts (Count 11) and digitally penetrated her vagina (Count 
12). 

TL’s evidence was that on her return to Australia she did not tell her mother.  She had 
first disclosed what had happened to her brother, in brief in about 2008-9, and then in 
more detail to a counsellor, Robyn Loughlin, in 2012.  TL contacted Australian police 
on 30 April 2013.  She had seen a report that British police were interviewing another 
Australian woman over allegations concerning the applicant.  She denied in evidence 
that, as recorded by the police, she had recently returned to Australia after living in 
the UK.  A police interview was arranged for 1 May 2013 but TL did not attend.  She 
said she went to a police station but did not enter because there were press outside.  
She denied telling police on 2 May that the reason for her non-attendance was that she 
had had a car accident and had been in hospital and was moving between houses.  She 
was interviewed on 5 May 2013 by British police.  By this stage there was so much 
media attention that she and her partner, FM, had moved from home into a hotel. 

On  2  May  TL  signed  an  exclusive  story  agreement  with  the  Bauer  Media  Group, 
brokered  by  an  agent.    On  6  May  2013  she  was  interviewed  by  an  Australian 
magazine for a payment of 22,000 Australian dollars.  The interview appeared in an 
article on 20 May.  On 7 May she signed an exclusive interview agreement with an 
Australian TV network for an agreed fee of 48,000 dollars.  That interview was duly 
recorded  and  broadcast.    When  interviewed  by  the  police  on  5  May  2013  TL  had 
denied that she had been offered or accepted any offers of payment for her story in 
relation to the applicant.  In June 2013 she admitted to the police that the assertions in 
the  May  interview  were  untrue  and  gave  an  account  of  her  involvement  with  the 
media, saying she regretted the earlier lies.  That history was in evidence before the 
jury.  TL said that her boyfriend, FM, was controlling and violent and wanted to make 
money  from  the  media.    He  had  persuaded  her  not  to  tell  the  police  initially  about 
media dealings. 

FM  had  made  two  statements  to  the  police  which  were  read  to  the  jury.    They 
conflicted in important respects.  Neither prosecution nor defence relied upon him as a 
witness  of  truth.    Evidence  of  his  bad  character,  including  a  prison  sentence  for  an 
assault on TL, was before the jury. 

Cathy  Henkel, the Artistic Director of the theatre  group, said that  after seeing TL’s 
interview on television she recalled her sitting on the applicant’s knee, although she 
did not know how accurate that memory was.  She had kept an eye on the  younger 
members  of  the  theatre  group  and  had  not  noticed  any  problems  with  TL.    TL’s 
mother  said  that  TL  told  her  that  she  had  had  a  happy  time  on  the  tour.    TL  had 
always worried about her weight, but bulimia had started after the tour.

There was also evidence about disclosure or complaints made by TL.  TL’s brother 
said that in 2008/2009, when the applicant was on television, TL had referred to him 
as  a  “kiddie-fiddler”.    Robyn  Loughlin  was  an  alcohol  treatment  counsellor  in 
Australia.  Her witness statement was read in evidence.  She said that TL had been 
referred to her organisation in September 2011 and that she had started working with 
TL  in  November  2012.    She  had  carried  out  an  assessment  on  28  November  2012 
during which TL had disclosed that she had been sexually assaulted by the applicant, 
and she described what TL had said.  

63. 

In  addition  to  the  foregoing  evidence,  there  were  admissions  before  the  jury  as 
follows: 

“28.  Medical  records  for  TL  dated  10  November  2006 
include that she told a doctor that she had been very upset and 
had  been  having  nightmares  as  she  had  been  thinking  about 
past sexual abuse by an uncle from the age of 5 to 15. 

29. 
Medical  records  and  records  from  drug  and  alcohol 
counselling  between  2011  and  2013  refer  to  TL  disclosing  a 
history of sexual abuse by a maternal uncle between the ages of 
4 and 7 years old. 

Medical records for TL from a Dr Leicester (consisting 
30. 
of two A4 pages of handwritten notes, two letters and a copy of 
a  business  card  for  Dr  Leicester)  include  a  counselling  report 
from  February  that  states:  ‘T  presented  with  a  number  of 
significant  effects from the sexual assault.   Indeed she suffers 
from  a  range  of  psychiatric  illnesses.    For  example,  she  has 
recently  been  diagnosed  with  borderline  personality  disorder 
and  post-traumatic  stress  disorder.    Equally,  she  has  suffered 
from anorexia and bulimia from the age of 11 to 31.  She has 
used alcohol as a way of trying to cope’.” 

64.  Ms  Loughlin’s  statement  revealed  that  TL  at  the  time  of  disclosure  to  her  suffered 
from post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol abuse, and family problems.  Her children 
had been taken into care and she was described as emotionally fragile. 

The applicant was interviewed by police under caution in November 2012 and August 
2013 regarding the allegations.  He declined to answer questions put to him but put 
forward written statements.  In due course the judge directed the jury not to draw any 
inference from his declining to answer questions in interview.   

As already stated, the applicant gave evidence denying the allegations.  He relied on 
character evidence from a number of witnesses  and on his  previous  good character.  
The applicant’s evidence was that although he recalled the occasion, he did not recall 
TL  and  her  account  had  been  made  up.    The  defence  pointed  to  inconsistencies 
between the accounts given by TL and accounts which Ms Loughlin and D.S. Hogan 
of  the  Australian  police  reported  she  had  provided  to  them.    Further,  the  defence 
relied  on  the  fact  that  no  complaint  had  been  made  by  TL  about  the  applicant  to 
professionals  who  had  treated  her  for  psychological  issues  over  a  number  of  years 
prior to her disclosure to Ms Loughlin, although there had been complaints about an

uncle.  Moreover, medical records showed that contrary to the evidence of TL and her 
mother, TL’s anorexia and bulimia had started prior to her trip to the UK. 

Applicant’s Submissions on Counts 10-12 – TL 

67. 

68. 

The safety of the convictions on these counts is challenged on two main bases.  The 
first matter relates to disclosure.  Subsequent to the applicant’s conviction there were 
civil  proceedings  for  damages  brought  by  TL  against  the  applicant.    In  those 
proceedings medical reports held by a number of medical institutions concerning TL 
were disclosed.  It is contended that the records indicate that TL suffered from more 
complex  mental  health  problems  and  psychiatric  issues  than  indicated  by  material 
disclosed at trial.  It was submitted that the prosecution had not fully discharged its 
disclosure duties under s.3 of the Criminal Procedure Investigations Act 1996 and that 
the verdicts were thereby rendered unsafe. 

The safety of the convictions was also challenged on the basis of fresh evidence from 
Liz  Bowsher,  described  as  a  defence  researcher.    We  have  considered  her  witness 
statement  on  a  provisional  basis.    Ms  Bowsher  has  produced  a  chronology  of 
Australian media reporting concerning the applicant between October and December 
2012.    This  indicates  that  on  29  November  2012  the  applicant  was  first  named  on 
Twitter  as  the  subject  of  police  investigations  and  was  followed  by  less  specific 
newspaper  coverage.    Accordingly,  it  is  said  that  Ms  Loughlin’s  evidence  of 
disclosure  on  the  preceding  day  was  highly  significant  and  called  for  live  evidence 
and cross-examination of Ms Loughlin. 

69. 

In addition, it is asserted that the judge was in error in summing up in referring to the 
date of TL’s referral to the counselling service (13 September 2011) in the context of 
the timing of her disclosure and in his observation to the jury that TL’s disclosure had 
taken place “long before there was any prospect of media involvement at all”.   

70.  We  have  read  the  statement  of  Kate  Prestidge,  the  applicant’s  solicitor  in  the  civil 
proceedings, setting out the details of material disclosed which it is submitted should 
have been disclosed at trial.  We have examined that material. 

71. 

Additionally,  reliance  is  sought  to  be  placed  upon  evidence  from  Ms  Bowsher  of 
details of an alleged sexual assault given in a television interview by Jimmy Savile’s 
great-niece on 22 October 2012.  It is asserted that the details are strikingly similar to 
the assault alleged by TL against the applicant. 

The Crown’s Response 

The  Crown’s  position  is  that  investigators  took  reasonable  and  appropriate  steps  to 
discharge  their  duty  to  pursue  all  reasonable  lines  of  enquiry  to  identify  relevant 
material in medical records concerning TL held by third parties.  It is submitted that 
notwithstanding  the  additional  material  which  has  emerged  since  the  trial  the 
convictions remain safe. As far as the fresh evidence of Liz Bowsher is concerned, Ms 
Loughlin’s  evidence  suggested  that  TL  was  unaware  that  the  applicant  had  been 
named  publicly  until  a  later  date,  namely,  April  2013.    This  was  then  followed  by 
contact with the police on 30 April 2013.  The defence had Ms Loughlin’s statement 
and  were  aware  of  the  date  of  TL’s  complaint.    They  had  decided  to  permit  the 

72.
--------

Rolf Harris 

statement to be read.  Accordingly, the evidence should not be admitted.  In any event 
it did not afford a ground for allowing the appeal. 

73. 

As  to  the  similarity  between  TL’s  account  and  that  of  Jimmy  Savile’s  niece,  a 
decision  had  been  taken  at  trial  not  to  recall  TL for  cross-examination  on  the  basis 
that her account had been based on that of the niece.  In those circumstances, this part 
of Ms Bowsher’s evidence was not admissible. 

Discussion on Counts 10-12 

74. 

75. 

The first area of challenge arises from what is said to be a failure by the Crown in its 
duties  under  s.3  of  the  Criminal  Procedure  and  Investigations  Act  1996  to  disclose 
material which might reasonably be considered capable of undermining the case for 
the  prosecution  or  assisting  the  case  for  the  defence.    Reference  was  made  to  the 
decision of this court in R v Flook [2010] 1 Cr App R 30.  There, this court noted that 
the 1996 Act did not make special provision in relation to materials held overseas by 
individuals,  companies  or  foreign  governmental  authorities.    The  court  stated  that 
nonetheless it was the obligation of the Crown, whether as investigator or prosecutor, 
to  pursue  reasonable  lines  of  enquiry  in  relation  to  material  that  might  be  held 
overseas in states outside the European Union.  If it appeared that there was relevant 
material, the Crown must take reasonable steps to obtain it.   

Subsequent to the trial and conviction of Mr Harris, TL instructed solicitors to bring a 
civil claim against him.  Ms Prestidge, representing Mr Harris in those proceedings, in 
due course received disclosure of medical records pertaining to TL.  By that means, 
Ms Prestidge was able to identify and obtain still further records.  It is those further 
records accumulated in the process  of the civil proceedings  which have enabled the 
applicant to pursue this argument. 

76. 

The  court  has  seen  copies  of  the  relevant  records.    It  is  clear  that  the  records  now 
provided  show  a  greater  number  of  consultations  between  TL  and  medical  or 
counselling services than had been disclosed by the Crown at the trial.   

77.  Mr Vullo’s submission is that those documents had been obtained with relevant ease 
so  that  the  Crown  had  not  discharged  its  duty  under  s.3.    It  was  submitted  that  the 
further material was relevant in that it showed a greater degree of contact between TL 
and  professional  services  in  the  decade  or  so  prior  to  her  complaint  to  the  police.  
Moreover,  it  was  significant  because  the  only  complaints  of  sexual  abuse  recorded 
were  made on  frequent  occasions  and  referred  to  an  uncle,  with  no  reference  being 
made  to  the  applicant.    For  the  Crown,  it  is  asserted  that  the  steps  taken  to  obtain 
medical information on TL held by third parties were reasonable in the circumstances, 
apparently using the assistance of the Australian Federal Police.   

78.  Whilst we have some reservations about whether reasonable steps were taken by or on 
behalf of the Crown to obtain the medical records, the matter was not investigated in 
any detail before us.  This was, no doubt, because the parties recognised that even if it 
be assumed that there was a failure to discharge disclosure duties, the question for us 
would in any event be whether the material now available has any significant impact 
upon the proceedings below.

79. 

80. 

It was frankly acknowledged by Mr Vullo that the additional material did not provide 
anything other than a repetition and reinforcement of information already available to 
the  jury.    The  phrase  he  used  was  “there  is  no  smoking  gun”.    We  think  this  is 
important. 

The  evidence  before  the  jury  presented  a  picture  of  a  troubled  and  unfortunate 
woman.    The  jury  was  aware  of  diagnoses  of  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  and 
borderline personality  disorder.    TL  had  suffered  from  family problems,  an  abusive 
relationship,  and  her  children  had  been  removed  from  her  care.    She  also  had  had 
eating disorders and depression, and was assessed as emotionally fragile at around the 
time she made her complaints.  The jury knew that she had sold her story to the media 
more than once and that initially she had lied to the police about that.  The jury also 
knew that over a significant period of time prior to her complaint about Mr Harris, she 
had  complained  to  doctors  and  other  professionals  about  sexual  abuse  of  her  by  an 
uncle when she had been younger, but had made no complaint whatsoever about Mr 
Harris.  It is perhaps significant that at trial the defence made no application under s.8 
of the 1996 Act for further disclosure.  That suggests that the information referred to 
above was considered to be sufficient for their purposes, even when it must have been 
apparent that further information might well be available.   

81. 

Having examined the further material it is apparent that although the picture already 
painted is confirmed in more detail, there is nothing new which might have assisted 
the defence or undermined the Crown.  Importantly, there is nothing in the records we 
have  seen  to  show  that  TL  was  a  fantasist  or  that  she  was  likely  to  make  false 
allegations.  The jury was already fully aware that over a number of years of contact 
with medical and other professionals, the only allegation of sexual misconduct related 
to an uncle and not to Mr Harris. 

82. 

In those circumstances, we do not think that this evidence would provide a basis for 
allowing an appeal and we decline to receive it in evidence. 

83.  We turn next to the issue raised about a television interview given by Jimmy Savile’s 
great-niece  which  was  said  to  contain  details  of  a  sexual  assault  which  bore 
similarities  to  TL’s  complaint.    The  defence  were  aware  of  the  YouTube  video 
relating  to  Jimmy  Savile.    There  is  an  issue  raised  as  to  whether  the  defence  were 
under a misapprehension as to the date of TL’s complaint to Ms Laughlan, to which 
we will return later, but it is clear that in any event careful consideration was given as 
to whether it would be wise to use the video to cross-examine TL and suggest that her 
account might have been derived from it.  We have seen an e-mail from then junior 
counsel, Mr Ray, sent to the rest of the defence team during the trial.  It is clear that 
there  was  serious  concern  that  the  point  might  backfire  at  a  time  when  it  was 
considered there were already strong reasons to put forward suggesting that TL was 
unreliable.  There was concern that those points could be diminished if reliance was 
placed on the YouTube video.  It was thought that the jury might  conclude that the 
description of what was done was “an obvious and unremarkable method by which to 
commit  the  assault”.    The  defence  were  keen  not  to  implant  in  the  jury’s  minds 
similarities between Rolf Harris and Jimmy Savile. 

That  reasoning  is  entirely  understandable  and  accords  with  our  own  reaction.    The 
decision not to use this material was in our view a sound tactical decision.  It is not 
the  purpose  of  appellate  proceedings  to  allow  a  second  bite  of  the  cherry  in  such 

84.

Rolf Harris 

circumstances  and  we  decline  to  receive  this  evidence.    Any  question  of  a 
misunderstanding  about  the  date  of  first  complaint  to  Ms  Loughlin  was  of  little 
moment in the making of the decision by the defence. 

85.  We turn to submissions arising from the date of the first complaint about Rolf Harris 
to Ms Loughlin on 28 November 2012.  Ms Loughlin’s statement to that effect was 
read at trial and the contention now made is that she should have been challenged as 
to  the  date  but  was  not,  because  of  a  misapprehension  by  the  defence  team  to  the 
effect  that  TL’s  first  complaint  had  been  made  in  September  2011.    The  basis  for 
testing  Ms  Loughlin’s  fixing  of  the  date  was  said  to  arise  from  the  fact  that  Ms 
Bowsher’s researches showed that in the days following 28 November 2012 a tweet 
referred to Mr Harris as being under investigation for sexual assault, and Australian 
newspapers  had  reported  that  an  Australian  entertainer  in  his  80s  was  under 
investigation (without naming Mr Harris).  In essence, if Ms Loughlin had been cross-
examined  and  the  date  of  complaint  then  moved  to  one  later  than  28  November,  it 
would enable the defence to suggest that TL had been influenced in her complaint by 
that publicity.   

86. 

87. 

There are a number of difficulties with this approach.   There was evidence that  TL 
had, in about 2008, complained to her brother about Rolf Harris.  That was supported 
by  evidence  from  the  brother,  although  he  had  not  appreciated  at  the  time  that  the 
comments made by his sister represented TL’s own experience.  Secondly, although 
an in-trial e-mail which we have seen appears to show that junior counsel had at one 
point  misapprehended  the  date  of  complaint  to  Ms  Loughlin,  examination  of  his 
papers  and  those  of  leading  counsel  show  that  both  had  highlighted  the  date  of  28 
November 2012.  Further, we have seen contemporaneous documentation created by 
Ms Loughlin which shows that the date of the assessment was 28 November 2012, as 
described in her witness statement.  The documents refer to an allegation of abuse but, 
in keeping with the clinic’s policy, did not record the alleged perpetrator. 

A decision was made not to seek to recall TL for cross-examination on this issue or to 
require Ms Loughlin as a live witness.  Mr Ray’s witness statement is very careful to 
state  in  Ms  Loughlin’s  case  that  he  cannot  recall  whether  he  was  involved  in  the 
decision,  but  that  such  decisions  were  not  made  without  discussion  and  careful 
consideration.  In the case of TL, he states that “it is relevant to note that the timing of 
TL’s complaint to Ms Loughlin was only one factor that led me to advise not to seek 
the recall of TL to the witness box”.   

88.  Whilst  the  e-mail  he  sent  during  the  trial  considering  the  possible  recall  of  TL  for 
cross-examination seems to show that he was under a misapprehension as to the date 
of complaint to Ms Loughlin, there is no material to show that any other member of 
the legal team was under the same misapprehension.  There had been two versions of 
Ms  Loughlin’s  statement  served.    Only  the  second  statement  contained  the  date  of 
complaint.    Both  leading  and  junior  counsel  had  marked  the  relevant  date  in  their 
papers and there is no reason to believe that leading counsel fell into the same error 
which Mr Ray made in his e-mail. 

In  any  event,  the  force  of  this  point  can  be  tested  by  posing  the  question  of  what 
would have happened if matters had proceeded as it is now suggested they should.  If 
TL had been recalled or if Ms Loughlin had been required to give evidence and the 
point  as  to  date  of  complaint  to  Ms  Loughlin  had  been  raised,  the  mistake  which 

89.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 
 

Rolf Harris 

junior counsel had made would have come to light and it would have been seen that 
TL  made  her  complaint  to  Ms  Loughlin  prior  to  any  reference  on  Twitter  to  Rolf 
Harris  and  prior  to  more  general  comment  in  the  Australian  media  stating  that  “an 
Australian legend” was being investigated by British police.  Thus the point would not 
have assisted the defence, and might have reinforced TL’s credibility with the jury. 

90.  We note in this context that there was evidence both from TL and Ms Loughlin to the 
effect that when Mr Harris’s name emerged in the mainstream media in April 2013 as 
the focus of an investigation into sexual assault, TL had reacted in a manner, in the 
presence of Ms Loughlin, which suggested to Ms Loughlin that only at that point had 
TL  become  aware  of  other  complaints  about  Mr  Harris.    It  was  this  disclosure  in 
Australian mainstream  media which was closely  followed by  TL’s complaint to the 
police.    It  seems  to  us  that  this  sequence  of  events  demonstrates  that  no  harm  was 
done to Mr Harris’s case by a failure to challenge Ms Loughlin as to the date when 
TL complained to her.  The documents we have seen, as we have already said, fix that 
date in a way which would have made challenge to it unproductive.  Accordingly, this 
particular  argument  fails.    The  fresh  materials  relied  on  do  not  afford  a  basis  for 
allowing the appeal and we decline to receive them. 

91. 

The remaining point made in the written grounds about the error in summing up was 
not pursued in oral submissions.  Nothing was made of the slip at the time, suggesting 
that the judge’s slip was an inconsequential error.  The judge had at another point in a 
necessarily lengthy summing up given the correct date.  We consider this to have been 
a minor error in an otherwise admirable summing up which could not even arguably 
affect the safety of the convictions.    

Conclusion on Counts 10-12 

92. 

Having considered the various matters raised in relation to these counts, we conclude 
that nothing arises which could impugn the safety of these convictions. 

Ground 3 – Cross-admissibility 

93. 

The defence submitted that if any of the convictions on Count 1 and Counts 10 to 12 
were  unsafe,  the  remaining  convictions  were  unsafe,  since  the  judge  had  given  a 
cross-admissibility  direction  in  relation  to  all  counts.    The  Crown  resisted  this  and 
urged that even if convictions on Count 1 and Counts 10 to 12 were unsafe, it did not 
affect the remaining verdicts.  The Crown pointed to a schedule of potential relevance 
identifying a number of common features between the complaints of WR, GP, JH and 
TL themselves and with the accounts of a series of witnesses which had been adduced 
by way of bad character evidence.  That evidence related to a number of other young 
females who alleged that they had been indecently assaulted by the applicant outside 
the jurisdiction prior to 1997. 

94.  We summarise the effect of the bad character evidence. 

i) 

CM (statement read) said that in 1989 when she was aged about  11 she was 
visiting  the  home  of  family  friends  in  Australia  where  the  applicant  was  a 
house guest.  He said he wanted to be the first to “tongue-kiss” her.  He held 
her  in  a  gentle  hug,  leant  forward  and  put  his  tongue  in  her  mouth.    In  his 
evidence, the applicant accepted visiting the house and that he must have met

ii) 

iii) 

iv) 

v) 

CM.  He said the incident simply did not happen and he did not know why CM 
would lie. 

MC (statement read) said that she met the applicant in 1970 when she was 16 
at  a  private  party  in  New  Zealand.    She  obtained  his  autograph  which  she 
produced,  together  with  a  photograph  of  them  together  at  the  event.    The 
applicant was friendly and asked her to dance.  While they danced he put his 
hand down her back onto her bottom and then moved his hand to the front of 
her  dress  and  up  between  her  legs  to  her  crotch.    The  applicant  said  that 
although he had been to New  Zealand many times he had no recollection of 
the party.  However he accepted, having seen the photograph and autograph, 
that he must have met MC there.  He denied any assault and said that MC was 
lying although he did not know the reason why. 

FW said that in 1970 when she was 18 she visited Malta for a holiday.  She 
met the applicant while seeking assistance in a bar for a friend who had been 
injured.    Later  that  day  she  had  a  drink  with  the  applicant  and  he  offered  to 
show her some art in a public area of the bar.  Once in that room he shut the 
door  and  tried  to  kiss  her.    Initially  she  was  flattered  but  then  he  started  to 
touch  her  breasts  and  put  his  hand  into  her  knickers  and  digitally  penetrated 
her vagina against her wishes.  He also placed her hand on his penis through 
his clothing.  In evidence the applicant accepted that he had met FW, since she 
had produced a photograph of them eating.  He said that he had no recall of her 
and that her account of sexual assault was a fabrication. 

Tony Porter, a retired actor and journalist, said that in about 1983-1985 whilst 
working  on  a  pre-recorded  television  series  with  the  applicant  he  saw  him 
tickle a female make-up artist’s breasts as she applied make-up, and heard him 
making lascivious noises.  The make-up artist was in her late 20s or mid 30s 
and  clearly  did  not  like  it.    The  applicant  said  he  had  no  recollection  of  Mr 
Porter, but he had not indecently assaulted the make-up artist and was allergic 
to face powder. 

SD  was  a  make-up  artist  who  said  that  in  1986,  when  she  was  24,  she  was 
responsible  for  the  applicant’s  make-up  for  a  television  production  in 
Australia.    Filming  took  place  over  eight  hours.    The  applicant  had  run  his 
hand up the inside of her leg and inside her shorts a number of times during 
that day.  The applicant’s brother had been present on one occasion and there 
was  an  all-male  crew.    She  had  been  upset  and  had  complained  to  her 
supervisor.    The  applicant  gave  evidence  that  he  had  never  taken  part  in  a 
show  which  had  lasted  eight  hours.    He  was  allergic  to  powder  and  SD  was 
simply  imagining  the  incident.    The  applicant’s  brother  gave  evidence  in 
which  he  said  he  had  no  recollection  of  an  eight-hour  production.    The 
allegation that groping took place in his presence was ridiculous and he would 
have stopped it. 

vi) 

JH said that the applicant hugged her when they were introduced at an event at 
a hardware store in May 1991.  At the time she was about 16.  The applicant 
put  his  hand  on  her  breast  and  his  other  hand  on  her  buttock.    When  she 
stepped back he had laughed.  She had told her mother, who was present, that 
he was a dirty old man.  JH’s mother said that the applicant had focussed on

Rolf Harris 

her  daughter  and  confirmed  that  her  daughter  had  stepped  away  from  close 
proximity  to  the  applicant.    He had  told  her  that  he was  “very  handy”.    Her 
daughter had refused to participate during his act.  The mother also said that 
the  applicant  had  rubbed  himself  against  her  briefly  but  forcefully  whilst  a 
photograph was taken.  She had trodden on his foot, looked him in the eye and 
told  him  that  he  was  a  disgusting  creature.    His  expression  changed  from  a 
smile to  a  sneer  and  he  leaned  forward  saying  that  “she”  (her  daughter)  had 
“liked it”.  The applicant accepted he had attended the event and had met JH 
and her mother.  A photograph of the three of them had been produced.  He 
denied indecent assault. 

Discussion on Cross-admissibility 

95. 

96. 

The  judge  gave  the  jury  a  direction  which  covered  not  only  the  counts  on  the 
indictment but the incidents of bad character evidence set out above.  No criticism is 
made of the terms of those directions or of additional directions in response to a jury 
question.  At the heart of those directions was the consideration of the unlikelihood of 
a  series  of  false  similar  complaints  being  made  independently  by  unconnected 
complainants.  The question of independent complaint was left to the jury to assess, 
along  with  their  appraisal  of  the  value  of  similarities.    Defence  submissions  as  to 
those matters were properly put before the jury. 

As  is  already  clear,  we  have  concluded  that  the  conviction  on  Count  1  cannot  be 
safely  sustained.    Mr  Vullo’s  submission  was  that  quashing  of  even  a  single  count 
would suffice to render the remaining convictions unsafe.  He argued that that unsafe 
conviction had the effect of poisoning the minds of the jury on the remaining matters.  
He placed reliance on the recent decision of this court in R v Morris [2016] EWCA 
Crim 2236.  We did not find that decision of assistance.  It was plainly based on the 
facts of that case where cross-admissibility arose as between two complainants, one of 
whom had given materially misleading evidence. 

97.  We note that although the judge told the jury they could apply the principle of cross-
admissibility if they saw fit after evaluating the evidence, he had also directed the jury 
to  give  separate  consideration  to  each  count  with  the  possibility  of  differential 
verdicts, depending on their view of the evidence.  There has been no fresh evidence 
adduced which directly touches upon the counts involving GP or JH.  There has been 
no fresh evidence which touches upon the bad character evidence.  There has been no 
discrete  submission  of  any  sort  challenging  any  of  that  evidence.    Count  1  differed 
from the other counts in the sense that there were real issues as to whether Mr Harris 
had ever visited the community centre and whether he had been correctly identified 
by WR.  In that respect, Count 1 was different from the remaining counts. 

98.  We do not accept that the approach urged by Mr Vullo is the correct one.  The issue 
for  us  is  whether  the  removal  of  Count  1  from  the  picture  renders  the  remaining 
convictions unsafe.  Our conclusion is that it does not.  The primary evidence relating 
to  GP  and  JH  remained  intact,  as  did  the  body  of  bad  character  evidence.    The 
subtraction of a single allegation does not in our view have significant impact where 
there  was  abundant  remaining  evidence.    We  note  that  in  relation  to  GP,  evidence 
emerged  of an  alleged  lie  told  by  Mr  Harris,  and  that  in  relation  to  JH  there was  a 
letter written by him to JH’s father in 1997 which, on one interpretation, represented a 
calculated attempt to avoid the police being informed and whose terms indicated that

it had been written by someone who knew perfectly well that he had been abusing her 
since she was 13. 

99. 

Stepping back and looking at the totality of the evidence of Counts 2 to 12, including 
the bad character evidence, we find nothing that causes us to doubt the safety of those 
convictions. 

Conclusion on Cross-admissibility 

100.  This ground is not properly arguable for the reasons given above.

EWCA Civ 1831 (16 November 2017) 

 

(on appeal from the Order of Mr Justice Supperstone in the Planning 

Court [2016] EWHC 1454 (Admin)) 

 

Judges: Lord Justices Treacy, Hickinbottom and Singh 
 
Background 
 
This  appeal  concerns  the  powers  of  London  boroughs  to  hire  out  public  parks  for 
music festivals.  It does not concern Royal Parks. 
 
The Wireless Festival is an annual music festival held in Finsbury Park.  The Friends 
of  Finsbury  Park  sought  to  challenge  the  decision  of  Haringey  London  Borough 
Council  (who  are  responsible  for  the  Park)  to  hire  part  of  the  Park  to  Festival 
Republic, the company which organised the  festival in 2016.  This decision involved 
closing  approximately  a  quarter  of  the  park  for  just  over  two  weeks.    The  Friends 
challenged  the  decision  by  way  of  judicial  review,  which  was  heard  by  Mr  Justice 
Supperstone on 9 June 2016.  He refused the substantive claim in a judgment on 22 
June  2016,  shortly  before  the  relevant  part  of  the  Park  was  closed  to  prepare  for 
Wireless  Festival  on  30  June  2016.    The  Festival  went  ahead;  but  the  Friends  were 
granted permission to appeal to resolve the issue for future festivals. 
 
The companies which run the Wireless Festival appeared as Interested Parties at the 
appeal, and the Open Spaces Society appeared as an Intervener. 
 
Arguments 
 
The Friends, with the support of the Open Spaces Society, submitted that the Council 
did not have the power to enclose such a large portion of the Park for such a long time 
and exclude members of the public who had not purchased tickets. The key issue was 
whether Section 145 of the Local Government Act 1972 provided the Council with the 
necessary power.
--------
The Friends argued that section 145 did not, because it only allows the Council to ‘set 
apart or enclose’ an area of the Park and does not explicitly state that the public may 
be  excluded.    The  Open  Spaces  Society  took  a  slightly  different  approach.    They 
accepted that section 145 gave the Council the right to exclude the public; but argued 
that  that  section  did  not  apply  here  because  an  earlier  statute  (Article  7  of  the 
Schedule to the Local Government Provisional Order Confirmation (Greater London 
Parks  and  Open  Spaces)  Act  1967),  which  specifically  concerned  London  local 
authorities,  applies  and  effectively  excludes  section  145,  which  consequently  only 
applies outside London.  The 1967 Act permits no more than 10%  of any park to be 
enclosed,  compared  with  the  quarter  of  the  Park  which  had  been  hired  out  for 
Wireless Festival. 
 
Judgment 
 
The Court of Appeal upheld the judgment of Mr Justice Supperstone.   
 
The  1967  Act  was  held  to  be  an  alternative  to  section  145  available  to  London  local 
authorities, such that it did not restrict section 145 from applying to London as well 
as the rest of the country.  Given the stark difference in their terms, if Parliament had 
intended the 1967 Act to exclude the operation of section 145 in London it would have 
made  this  clear.    The  power  to  enclose  part  of  the  Park  in  section  145  was  held  to 
include the power to exclude non-paying  members of the public.   That accords with 
the  ordinary  meaning  of  the  word  ‘enclose’,  and  is  necessary  to  give  effect  to  the 
intention of Parliament, because without the power to exclude the public the power to 
enclose a portion of the Park would be empty. 
 
The  judgment  deals  only  with  the  narrow  issue  of  statutory  construction  as  to 
whether a London borough has power to hire out part of a park in its area without the 
restrictions  in  the  1967  Act.    In  this  case,  the  merits  were  not  in  issue:  it  was  not 
contended that, if the Council had the power to hire out the part of the park for the 
Wireless  Festival,  then  it  acted  unlawfully in exercising  that  power  in the  particular 
circumstances of this case.

Appeal’s decision.   It  does not  form part  of the reasons for the decision.

Approved Judgment

Lord Justice Hickinbottom: 

The Background 

Large scale music festivals have been a  particular feature of  London parks since the 
1960s.  This  appeal  raises a narrow but  important  point as to  the powers of  London 
boroughs to permit parks to be used for such events. 

The  issue  arises  in  the  context  of the  hire  of  Finsbury  Park  (“the  Park”),  a  115-acre 
park owned by the Respondent London Borough (“the Council”), for an event known 
as the Wireless Festival 2016.   

The  Park  has  played  host  to  large  scale  events,  including  commercial  ticket-only 
concerts attended by tens of thousands of people such as this, for many years.  These 
events  are  controversial,  in  the  sense  that  they  are  clearly  a  source  of  great 
entertainment  and  enjoyment  for  those  who  attend;  but  they  are,  equally  clearly, 
regarded  as  a  considerable  inconvenience  to  some  who  do  not,  particularly  local 
residents  and  those  whose  enjoyment  of  the  Park  is  diminished  when  they  are 
displaced from those parts of the Park that are, from time-to-time, used for the events.  
It  is  therefore  unsurprising  that,  over  the  last  few  years,  these  events  have  been  the 
subject of much consideration by the Council.   

The  Council’s  Finsbury  Park  Management  Plan  2013-16  included  an  events  policy, 
namely that there would be a maximum of five commercial events of up to 30,000 to 
40,000  people  to  be  held  each  year,  with  a  further  maximum  of  three  separate 
funfairs.   

Under  the  Council’s  Outdoor  Events  Policy  (which,  after  full  consultation,  was 
adopted  on  7  January  2014),  applications  for  major  events  in  the  Park  have  to  be 
lodged  at  least  nine  months  prior  to  the  proposed  date  of  the  event,  to  allow  for 
consultation  with  (amongst  others)  the  Appellant,  an  organisation  of  Friends  of  the 
Park recognised by the Council.  In 2014, the Council also set up the Finsbury Park 
Stakeholders Group, a group of elected councillors, officers from the Council and the 
adjacent  London  Boroughs  of  Hackney  and  Islington,  local  businesses,  the  police, 
residents  and  other  interested  parties  including  the  Appellant.    One  key  role  of  the 
Stakeholder  Group  is  “to  review  and  comment  on  initial  and  final  draft  event 
management plans for major events”.   

In addition to permission to hire the relevant part of the Park, any promoter of such an 
event  also  requires  a  premises  licence  from  the  Council’s  Special  Licensing  Sub-
committee,  under  Part  3  of  the  Licensing  Act  2003.    That  is  also  subject  to  a 
significant  procedure,  during  which  interested  parties  have  an  opportunity  to  make 
representations.    

The  Wireless  Festival  is  an  annual  event,  being  held  in  Hyde  Park  and  Queen 
Elizabeth Olympic Park before the festival moved to the Park in 2014.  It is promoted 
by the Second Interested Party (“Live Nation”).  Its application for a premises licence 
in  2013  incorporated  an  Event  Management  Plan  of  over  70  pages,  a  Crowd 
Management & Security Plan of similar length, a Medical Management Plan, a Waste 
Management  Plan,  a  Noise  Management  Plan,  a  Show-stop  Procedure,  an  Alcohol 
Management Plan, and Health and Safety Rules for Contractors.  The Appellant was

consulted  and  made  representations  generally  adverse  to  the  application.    The 
application was granted by the Council through its Special Licensing Sub-committee 
on 16 December 2013, subject to 113 conditions.  

The Council received many complaints in relation to the 2015 festival, which resulted 
in the Council’s Overview and Scrutiny Committee setting up a review “to reflect on 
and  understand  the  impact  of  recent  large  events  that  have  taken  place  in  Finsbury 
Park  such  as  the  Wireless  Festival”.    The  Appellant  was  invited  to  give  evidence  to 
the review, which it did.  The Committee published its report in early October 2015, 
which set out various ways in which the impact of the festival could be mitigated. 

The  First  Interested  Party  (“Festival  Republic”)  is  an  associated  company  of  Live 
Nation.  Its application for the Wireless Festival  2016 was notified to the Appellant, 
as a consultee, on 3 December 2015.  It required closing part of the Park from 25 June 
to 15 July 2016, with a two stage music event (including a community/charity event) 
on  2  July  and  a  two  or  three  stage  music  event  on  8-10  July  2016.      During  the 
performance days, 27% of the Park would be closed to the public.  The earlier stage of 
the event was later cancelled, with the result that the closures began, not on 25 June, 
but on 30 June 2016. 

The Appellant  submitted an objection, not  only on the merits of the application, but 
also  contending  that  the  Council  did  not  have  power  to  authorise  such  an  event.  
However,  on  18  March  2016,  the  Leader  of  the  Council,  purporting  to  exercise 
powers  under  section  145  of  the  Local  Government  Act  1972  (“the  1972  Act”), 
determined to hire the relevant part of the Park to Festival Republic for the festival.     

The Appellant commenced judicial review of that decision on 29 April 2016.  At an 
expedited  rolled-up  hearing  on  9  June  2016,  Supperstone  J  granted  permission  to 
apply  for  judicial  review,  but  dismissed  the  claim,  giving  his  reasons  in  a  judgment 
handed down on 22 June 2016 ([2016] EWHC 1454 (Admin)).   

The music festival went ahead.  However, on the basis that this was an issue of some 
importance and would at least determine whether this annual event could take place in 
the  Park  in  the  future,  on  19  December  2016,  Lewison  LJ  granted  permission  to 
appeal on a single ground, namely that Supperstone J had erred in law in holding that 
section  145  of  the  1972  Act  authorised  the  Council  to  hire  out  the  Park  for  the 
Wireless Festival 2016.  Permission was refused in respect of all other grounds, and 
nothing more need be said about them. 

Before  us,  Richard  Harwood  QC  appeared  for  the  Appellant,  supported  by  George 
Laurence QC and Ross Crail of Counsel appearing for the Intervenor, the Open Spaces 
Society.  Philip Kolvin QC and Ranjit Bhose QC appeared for the Council, supported by 
Robert McCracken QC and Juan Lopez of Counsel appearing for the Interested Parties.  
The court is grateful for their able, helpful and focused submissions. 

The Law 

The  Park  was  established  by  section  7  of  the  Finsbury  Park  Act  1857,  “for  the  use, 
recreation and enjoyment of the public”.  It was originally owned by the Metropolitan 
Board of Works (set up in 1855 as a cross-London borough public body, particularly 
to deal with infrastructure issues in the light of the rapid growth of the capital), but, as

a  result  of  successive  local  government  reorganisations,  its  ownership  has  passed 
through  the  hands  of  a  number  of  public  bodies,  including  the  London  County 
Council, the Greater London Council and, now, the Council. 

The 1857 Act has since been repealed; and, pursuant to article 32 of, and Schedule 5 
to, the London Authorities (Property Etc) Order 1964 (SI 1964 No 1464), the Park is 
now  held  by  the  Council  for  the  purpose  that  is  set  out  in  section  10  of  the  Open 
Spaces Act 1906 (“the 1906 Act”), which provides, so far as relevant: 

“A  local  authority  who  have  acquired  any  estate  or  interest  in 
or control over any open space or burial ground under this Act 
shall, subject to any conditions under which the estate, interest 
or control was so acquired— 

(a) 
hold and administer the open space or burial ground 
in  trust  to  allow,  and  with  a  view  to,  the  enjoyment 
thereof by the public as an open space within the meaning 
of  this  Act  and  under  proper  control  and  regulation  and 
for no other purpose…”. 

Section 20 defines “open space”: 

“The  expression  ‘open  space’  means  any  land,  whether 
inclosed or not, on which there are no buildings or of which not 
more than one-twentieth part is covered with buildings, and the 
whole  of  the  remainder  of  which  is  laid  out  as  a  garden  or  is 
used for purposes of recreation, or lies waste and unoccupied.” 

For  the  sake  of  completeness,  I  should  say  that,  even  where  a  park  has  been 
established  under  statutory  provisions  that  contain  no  express  comparable  trust  (e.g. 
section  164  of  the  Public  Health  Act  1875  (“the  1875  Act”)),  these  have  been 
construed  by  the  courts  as  having  a  similar  effect  (see,  e.g.,  Attorney  General  v 
Sunderland  Corporation  (1876)  2  Ch  D  634  at  page  641  per  James  LJ,  a  case 
concerning  the  predecessor  provision,  namely  section  74  of  the  Public  Health  Act 
1848), i.e. it is held on trust for the purpose of public enjoyment.   That construction 
was  recognised  by  Parliament  in  section  122  of  the  1972  Act,  which  concerns 
appropriation of land by local authorities and expressly refers to “land held in trust for 
enjoyment by the public in accordance with [section 164 of the 1875 Act]”. 

Therefore, the Council hold the Park under section 10 of the 1906 Act on a statutory 
trust for use by the public for its recreation, such that it has been said that the public 
are its beneficial owners (see Blake v Hendon Corporation [1962] 1 QB 283 at page 
300  per  Devlin  LJ).    Where  such  a  trust  exists,  it  is  well-established  that  the  public 
have  a  statutory  right  to  use  the  land  for  recreational  purposes  (R  (Barkas)  v  North 
Yorkshire  County  Council  [2014]  UKSC  31;  [2015]  AC  195  at  [20]  per  Lord 
Neuberger  of  Abbotsbury  PSC).    Therefore,  generally,  the  local  authority  owner 
“must  allow  the  public  the  free  and  unrestricted  use  of  it”  (The  Churchwardens  and 
Overseers of Lambeth Parish v London County Council [1897] AC 625 at page 631 
per Lord Halsbury LC), and it  cannot  exclude the general public from it “even for a 
single  day”  (Attorney  General  v  The  Loughborough  Local  Board  (1881)  The  Times 
31  May  1881,  recently  quoted  and  confirmed  in  Western  Power  Distribution
--------
Investments  Limited  v  Cardiff  County  Council  [2011]  EWHC  300  (Admin)  at  [16] 
per Ouseley J).   

However,  of  course,  that  general  rule  bows  to  contrary  legislative  provision.    For 
example, section 44 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act 1890 (“the 1890 Act”) 
allows for the closure of a park to the general public for a limited number of days per 
year, and the use of it on those days by some particular public institution or for some 
particular public event.  It originally provided:  

institution,  or 

“[An  urban  authority]  may  on  such  days  as  they  think  fit  (not 
exceeding 12 days in any one year, nor [four] consecutive days 
on  any  one  occasion)  close  to  the  public  any  park  or  pleasure 
ground provided by them or any part thereof, and may grant the 
use  of  the  same,  either  gratuitously  or  for  payment,  to  any 
public  charity  or 
for  any  agricultural, 
horticultural,  or  other  show,  or  any  other  public  purpose,  or 
may  use  the  same  for  any  such  show  or  purpose;  and  the 
admission  to  the  said  park  or  pleasure  ground,  or  such  part 
thereof,  on  the  days  when  the  same  shall  be  so  closed  to  the 
public  may  be  either  with  or  without  payment,  as  directed  by 
the  [urban  authority],  or  with  the  consent  of  the  [urban 
authority] by the society or persons to whom the use of the park 
or  pleasure  ground,  or  such  part  thereof,  may  be  granted: 
Provided  that  no  such  park  or  pleasure  ground  shall  be  closed 
on any Sunday or bank holiday.”  

Section 53 of the Public Health Act 1961 amended that section, so that it now applies 
to all local authorities, and extends the number of consecutive days upon which a park 
or pleasure ground might close from four to six, excluding Sundays.  Section 12 of the 
Greater  London  Council  (General  Powers)  Act  1978  amended  the  section  further  to 
allow for some Sunday closing in London.       

The  power  to  close  parks  and  pleasure  grounds  in  section  44  of  the  1890  Act  as 
amended applies to all local authorities.  Specific local provisions are found in other 
statutes.    For  example,  “notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  section  44  of  the  1890 
Act”,  section  11  of  the  Derbyshire  Act  1981  gives  the  Derby  council  the  power  to 
close to the public an area of the Bass Recreation Ground not exceeding 1.42 hectares 
for  54  days  (including  Sundays)  per  year  and  section  77  of  the  West  Yorkshire  Act 
1980 gives the Leeds council the right to close Roundhay Park for up to 10 Sundays 
per year, but in either case otherwise subject to the restrictions found in section 44.   

In  addition,  for  over  a  century,  there  have  been  specific  statutory  provisions  for 
entertainment in parks etc, including provision for the restriction of access to the parts 
of  parks  where  and  when  entertainment  is  provided.    Section  76(1)  of  the  Public 
Health  Acts  Amendment  Act  1907  (“the  1907  Act”),  which  applied  to  the  whole  of 
England  and  Wales,  gave  power  to  the  Local  Government  Board  (the  central 
government  body  that  oversaw  local  government)  to  make  rules  prescribing 
restrictions and conditions subject to which the powers conferred in the section “shall 
with respect to any area in a public park or pleasure ground be exercisable in relation 
to the enclosure or setting apart of the area…”; and, subject to those rules, it provided:

22. 

 

“… [T]he local authority shall, in addition to any powers under 
any general Act, have the following powers with respect to any 
public park or pleasure ground provided by them or under their 
management and control, namely powers— 

(a)  To enclose during time of frost any part of the park 
or  ground  for  the  purpose  of  protecting  ice  for  skating, 
and  charge  admission  to  the  part  inclosed,  but  only  on 
condition  that  at  least  three-quarters  of  the  ice  available 
for the purpose of skating is open to the use of the public 
free of charge; 

(b)  To set apart any such part of the park or ground as 
may be fixed by the local authority, and may be described 
in  a  notice  board  affixed  or  set  up  in  some  conspicuous 
position in the park or ground for the purpose of cricket, 
football, or any other  game or recreation, and to  exclude 
the public from the part set apart while it is in actual use 
for that purpose; 

… 

(e)  To  enclose  any  part  of  the  park  or  ground,  not 
exceeding  one  acre,  for  the  convenience  of  persons 
listening  to  any  band  of  music,  and  charge  admission 
thereto; 

… 

(g)  To  provide  and  maintain  any  reading  rooms, 
pavilions,  or  other  buildings  and  conveniences,  and  to 
charge  for  admission  thereto,  subject  in  the  case  of 
reading  rooms  to  the  limitation  that  such  a  charge  shall 
not  be  made  on  more  than  twelve  days  in  any  one  year, 
nor on more than four consecutive days;…” 

Section 76(4) provided that no power under the section should be exercised “in such a 
manner as to contravene any covenant or condition subject to which a gift or lease of 
a public park or pleasure ground has been accepted or made…”, without the consent 
of the donor or other person entitled to the benefit of such a covenant or condition. 

Although there were express provisions for excluding the public from part of a park 
“while in actual use” for games or other recreation, it is clear that the power in section 
76 of the 1907 Act was additional to the power to close a park under section 44 of the 
1890 Act, the latter being a general power to close the whole or part of a park (subject 
to  time  restrictions)  and  the  former  being  a  specific  power  directed  towards 
recreation, with its own restrictions but not subject to the restrictions in the 1890 Act.  
In any event, section 11 of the 1907 Act specifically provided: 

“All  powers  given  to  a  local  authority  under  this  Act  shall  be 
deemed to be in addition to and not in derogation of any other
--------
powers  conferred  upon  such  local  authority  by  any  Act  of 
Parliament,  law,  or  custom,  and  such  other  powers  may  be 
exercised  in  the  same  manner  as  if  this  Act  had  not  been 
passed.” 

As I have indicated, section 76 of the 1907 Act applied to the whole of England and 
Wales,  including  London.    However,  the  London  County  Council  (General)  Powers 
Acts 1895-1927 made various specific provisions in relation to parks and open spaces 
in  London.    The  London  County  Council  (General  Powers)  Act  1935  generally 
brought  these  together,  and  made  specific  provision  for  London  local  authorities  in 
respect of “open space”, which was widely defined to include “any public park heath 
common  recreation  ground  pleasure  ground  garden  walk  ornamental  enclosure  or 
disused  burial  ground  under  the  control  and  management  of  the  local  authority…” 
(section  41).    Section  42(1)  gave  local  authorities  broad  powers  in  relation  to  open 
space,  including  the  provision  of  open  air  baths,  places  for  dancing,  golf  courses, 
tennis courts, gymnasia, and rifle ranges (section 42(1)(a)); and also to: 

“(b)  provide or contribute towards the  expenses of or by  way 
of subsidy to any band of music to perform in the open space; 

(c)  provide entertainments including bands of music concerts 
dramatic  performances  cinematographic  exhibitions  and 
pageants; 

(d)  provide and maintain in time of frost facilities for skating 
and flood any part of the open space in order to provide ice for 
skating; 

… 

(g)  erect  and  maintain  for  the  purposes  of  or  in  connection 
with  any  of  the  foregoing  paragraphs  (a)  to  (f)  or  for  or  with 
any other purpose relating to  the open space such buildings or 
structures as they consider necessary or desirable… 

(h) 
set apart or enclose in connection with any of the matters 
referred  to  in  this  section  any  part  of  the  open  space  and 
preclude  any  person  from  entering  that  part  while  so  set  apart 
or enclosed other than a person to whom access is permitted by 
the  local  authority  or  (where  the  right  of  so  setting  apart  or 
enclosing is granted to any person by the local authority under 
the powers of this part of this Act) by such person: 

Provided that— 

(i)  where  any  part  of  an  open  space  is  set  apart  or 
enclosed under the foregoing provisions of this subsection 
for the playing of games and that part is not specially laid 
out and maintained for that purpose the power under this 
subsection to preclude any person from entering that part

shall  not  apply  while  the  part  is  not  in  actual  use  for 
games; 

the part of any open space set apart or enclosed for 
(ii) 
to  or  viewing  an

entertainment 
(including  a  band  concert  dramatic 
performance cinematographic exhibition or pageant) shall 
not exceed in any open space one acre;…”. 

listening 

By  section  45(a)(iii),  a  local  authority  was  given  power  to  make  reasonable  charges 
for  “admission  to  or  the  use  of  any  part  of  any  open  space  set  apart  or  enclosed  by 
them under paragraph (h) of [section 42(1)]”.  

Section  69  of  the  1935  Act  made  clear  that  the  powers  conferred  by  the  Act  were 
cumulative  to,  and  not  in  substitution  for  or  derogation  of,  powers  exercisable  by  a 
local authority under any other enactment. 

Section  76(1)(e)  of  the  1907  Act  was  repealed  by  section  147  of,  and  Part  V  of 
Schedule 2 to, the Local Government Act 1948 (“the 1948 Act”).  The 1948 Act did 
not  repeal  section  42  of  the  1935  Act;  but  section  132  of  the  1948  Act  expressly 
applied to all London boroughs including the Common Council of the City of London 
(section  132(7)).    Section  132,  under  the  heading  “Provision  of  entertainments”, 
provided as follows (so far as relevant to this appeal): 

“(1)  A local  authority may do, or arrange for the doing of, or 
contribute  towards  the  expenses  of  the  doing  of,  anything 
necessary  or  expedient  for  any  of  the  following  purposes,  that 
is to say— 

the provision of an entertainment of any nature or of 

(a) 
facilities for dancing; 

(b) 
the provision of a theatre, concert hall, dance hall or 
other premises suitable for the giving of entertainments or 
the holding of dances; 

(c) 

the maintenance of a band or orchestra; 

(d) 
any  purpose  incidental  to  the  matters  aforesaid, 
including the provision,  in  connection  with  the  giving of 
any  entertainment  or  the  holding  of  any  dance,  of 
refreshments  or  programmes  and  the  advertising  of  any 
such entertainment or dance:… 

(2)  Without  prejudice  to  the  generality  of  the  provisions  of 
the preceding subsection, a local authority— 

(a)  may  for  the  purposes  therein  specified  enclose  or 
set apart any part of a park or pleasure ground belonging 
to  the  authority  or  under  their  control  not  exceeding  one 
acre  or  one-tenth  of  the  area  of  the  park  or  pleasure 
ground whichever is the greater;
--------
(b)  may  permit  any  theatre,  concert  hall,  dance  hall  or 
other  premises  provided  by  them  for  the  purposes  of  the 
preceding  subsection  and  any  part  of  a  park  or  pleasure 
ground  enclosed  or  set  apart  as  aforesaid,  to  be  used  by 
any  other  person,  on  such  terms  as  to  payment  or 
otherwise as the authority think fit, and may authorise that 
other person to make charges for admission thereto; 

(c)  may themselves make charges for admission to any 
entertainment  or  dance  held  by  them  and  for  any 
refreshment  or  programmes  supplied  at  any  such 
entertainment or dance: 

Provided  that  nothing  in  this  subsection  shall  authorise  any 
authority  to  contravene  any  covenant  or  condition  subject  to 
which  a  gift  or  lease  of  a  public  park  or  pleasure  ground  has 
been  accepted  or  made  without  the  consent  of  the  donor, 
grantor, lessor or other person entitled in  law to  the benefit of 
the covenant or condition.  

(3)  The expenditure of a local authority under this section… 
shall not in any year exceed the product of a rate of sixpence in 
the pound, plus the net amount of any receipts of the authority 
from any such charges or payments as are referred to in the last 
preceding subsection…”. 

This section thus amounted to a spatial extension from section 76(1) of the 1907 Act, 
in  that,  instead  of  the  restriction  being  one  acre,  it  was  one  acre  or  one  tenth  of  the 
area of the park or pleasure ground whichever was the greater. 

27. 

Following  the  Report  of  the  Royal  Commission  on  Local  Government  in  Greater 
London, the London Government Act 1963 effectively abolished the London County 
Council  and  all  existing  London  metropolitan  boroughs,  replacing  them  with  the 
Greater London Council and 32 new London boroughs.  Section 87(3) provided that: 

“For  the  purpose  of  securing  uniformity  in  the  law  applicable 
with respect to any matter in different parts of the relevant area, 
or  in  the  relevant  area  or  any  part  thereof  and  other  parts  of 
England  and  Wales,  any  appropriate  Minister  may,  after 
consultation with such of the appropriate councils as appear to 
the Minister to be interested, by provisional order made after 1 
April  1965  amend,  repeal  or  revoke  any  Greater  London 
statutory provision…”.      

Under  that  subsection,  the  Minister  of  Housing  and  Local  Government  made  an 
Order,  entitled “Provisional order  for securing uniformity in  the law applicable with 
respect to parks and open spaces”.  That Order was later confirmed by Parliament in 
the  Ministry  of  Housing  and  Local  Government  Provisional  Order  Confirmation 
(Greater London Parks and Open Spaces) Act 1967 (“the 1967 Act”).  “Open space” 
was defined in article 6 of the Schedule, widely, as including “any public park, heath, 

28.
--------
29. 

30. 

 

common, recreation ground, pleasure  ground,  garden, walk,  ornamental  enclosure or 
disused burial ground under the control and management of a local authority”.   

Article  7  of  the  Schedule  (“article  7  of  the  1967  Act”)  authorises  the  use  of  open 
space  in  London  for  the  provision  of  entertainment  provided  that  the  area  set  apart 
does not exceed one acre or one tenth of the open space, whichever is greater, in terms 
somewhat  similar  to  section  42(1)  of  the  1935  Act.    It  thus  gives  a  local  authority 
power  to  provide  and  maintain  open  air  or  indoor  baths,  golf  courses  and  “indoor 
facilities for any  form  of recreation whatsoever”  (article 7(1)(a)(v)).   As  particularly 
relevant to this appeal, article 7 provides:  

“(1)   A local authority may in any open space— 

…  

(b)  provide  amusement 
including 
performances, cinematograph exhibitions and pageants;  

fairs  and  entertainments 
dramatic 

bands 

of  music, 

concerts, 

… 

(g) 
set  apart  or  enclose  in  connection  with  any  of  the 
matters  referred  to  in  this  article  any  part  of  the  open 
space and preclude any person from entering that part so 
set apart or enclosed other than a person to whom access 
is  permitted  by  the  local  authority  or  (where  the  right  of 
so  setting  apart  or  enclosing  is  granted  to  any  person  by 
the  local  authority  under  the  powers  of  this  part  of  this 
order) by such person.  

Provided that  

…  

(ii) the part of any open space set apart or enclosed for the 
use  of  persons  listening  to  or  viewing  an  entertainment 
(including  a  band  concert,  dramatic  performance, 
cinematograph exhibition or pageant) shall not  exceed in 
any  open  space  one  acre  or  one  tenth  of  the  open  space, 
whichever is the greater.”  

Whilst altering the spatial exclusion, this later wording appears largely to derive from 
and replicate proviso (ii) to section 42(1) of the 1935 Act. 

The  1972  Act  accompanied  the  major  local  government  reorganisation  of  that  year.  
Except  where  excluded  by  a  particular  provision  (e.g.  section  144,  which  expressly 
proscribes all  London authorities from  having the power to  contribute to  advertising 
the  commercial  and  industrial  benefits  of  London),  the  Act  expressly  applies  to  the 
Greater London Council and London borough councils (section 270).   At least to an 
extent, it sought to rationalise the powers of local government.  For example, as I have 
already  indicated,  it  extended  the  power  in  section  44  of  the  1890  Act  to  all  local 
authorities.
--------
31. 

 

The 1972 Act did not repeal any part of the 1935 Act or the 1967 Act; but section 272 
of,  and  Schedule  30  to,  the  1972  Act  repealed  section  132  of  the  1948  Act.    It  was 
replaced by section 145 of the 1972 Act, which is at the heart of this appeal.  Falling 
within  Part  VII  of  the  Act,  under  the  heading  “Miscellaneous  powers  of  local 
authorities”, it provides, under the particular heading “Provision of entertainments”:  

“(1)  A local  authority may do, or arrange for the doing of, or 
contribute  towards  the  expenses  of  the  doing  of,  anything 
(whether inside or outside their area) necessary or expedient for 
any of the following purposes, that is to say— 

(a)  the provision of an entertainment of any nature or of 
facilities for dancing;  

(b)  the provision of a theatre, concert hall, dance hall or 
other premises suitable for the giving of entertainments or 
the holding of dances;  

(c)  the maintenance of a band or orchestra;  

(d)  the development and improvement of the knowledge, 
understanding  and  practice  of  the  arts  and  the  crafts 
which serve the arts;  

(e)  any  purpose  incidental  to  the  matters  aforesaid, 
including  the  provision  of  refreshments  or  programmes 
and  the  advertising  of  any  entertainment  given  or  dance 
or exhibition of arts or crafts held by them.  

(2)  Without  prejudice  to  the  generality  of  the  provisions  of 
sub-section (1) above, a local authority— 

(a)  may for the purposes therein specified enclose or set 
apart  any  part  of  a  park  or  pleasure  ground  belonging  to 
the authority or under their control;  

(b)  may  permit  any  theatre,  concert  hall,  dance  hall  or 
other premises provided by them for the purposes of sub-
section  (1)  above  and  any  part  of  a  park  or  pleasure 
ground  enclosed  or  set  apart  as  aforesaid  to  be  used  by 
any  other  person,  on  such  terms  as  to  payment  or 
otherwise as the authority think fit, and may authorise that 
other person to make charges for admission thereto;  

(c)  may  themselves  make  charges  for  admission  to  any 
entertainment  given  or  dance  or  exhibition  of  arts  or 
crafts  held  by 
them  and  for  any  refreshment  or 
programmes supplied thereat.   

(3)  Sub-section (2) above shall not authorise any authority to 
contravene any covenant or condition subject to which a gift or 
lease of a public park or pleasure ground has been accepted or
--------
made without the consent of the donor, grantor, lessor or other 
person  entitled  in  law  to  the  benefit  of  the  covenant  or 
condition.  

(4)  Nothing  in  this  section  shall  affect  the  provisions  of  any 
enactment  by  virtue  of  which  a  licence  is  required  for  the 
public  performance  of  a  stage  play  or  the  public  exhibition  of 
cinematograph films, or for boxing or wrestling entertainments 
or for public music or dancing, or for the sale of alcohol.   

In  this  section,  the  expression  ‘local  authority’  includes 

(5) 
the Common Council.”   

32. 

It was under section 145 that the Council purported to act when hiring part of the Park 
to the First Respondent for the Wireless Festival 2016. 

The Appellant’s Case 

33.  Mr  Harwood  and  Mr  Laurence  put  their  submissions  somewhat  differently,  but,  as 
one  would  expect,  there  was  some  significant  overlap.    Both  emphasised  that  the 
purpose of the statutory  trust  under  which the Park  is  held  by  the Council  is  for the 
provision  of  recreation  for  the  public,  an  adjunct  of  which  is  that  the  Council  is 
generally  unable  to  exclude  the  public  from  the  whole  or  any  part  of  the  Park.  
Exclusion can only be by way of statutory provision.  It was common ground that the 
Council  did  not  have  power  to  hire  part  of  the  Park  for  the  Wireless  Festival  under 
either section 44 of the 1890 Act (because of the temporal restrictions in that Act) or 
article 7 of the 1967 Ac (because of the spatial restrictions in that Act).  The issue is 
whether the Council had such a power under section 145 of the 1972 Act. 

34. 

35. 

There  were  two  main  strands  of  challenge  to  the  Council’s  conclusion,  with  which 
Supperstone J agreed, that it had. 

First, Mr Harwood emphasised that section 145 does not authorise any local authority 
to restrict any private or public rights, including the right of the public to use the Park 
for the purposes of recreation.  He submitted that, in particular, it does not authorise a 
local  authority  to  exclude  the  public,  or  any  member  of  it,  from  any  part  of  open 
space.  The only relevant extant provisions that allow such exclusion are section 44 of 
the 1890 Act and article 7 of the 1967 Act.  The construction of section 145 favoured 
by the Council, which would enable any part of the Park to be hired out for any length 
of time, renders both of those provisions redundant, and implicitly repeals them.  That 
cannot  have  been  the  intention  of  Parliament,  particularly  as  section  44  has  been 
amended since the passing of the 1972 Act, by the Greater London Council (General 
Powers) Act 1978 (see paragraph 18 above).   

36.  Mr Laurence’s primary point began from a different starting point.  For the purposes 
of this appeal, he accepted that a local authority did have the power to restrict access 
to any part of an open space that it may enclose or set apart under section 145(2)(a).   
However, he submitted that article 7 of the 1967 Act confers upon London councils a 
power  to  close  parks  and  pleasure  grounds  for  the  purposes  of  providing 
entertainment.  It is intended to deal with essentially similar circumstances as section 
145,  but  is  of  more  particular  application.    The  maxim  generalia  specialibus  non
--------
derogant  applies,  i.e.  in  bringing  in  the  general  power  in  section  145,  Parliament 
cannot  be  taken  as  intending  to  repeal,  derogate  from  or  otherwise  alter  the  more 
specific power, particularly as section 145 was enacted only five years after article 7 
of the 1967 Act. 

The Judgment of Supperstone J 

37. 

Supperstone  J  dealt  with  these  arguments,  insofar  as  they  were  before  him,  in 
reasonably short order, as follows: 

“45.  …  I  consider  that  section  145  of  the  1972  Act,  of  itself 
and  standing  alone,  provides  the  Council  with  the  necessary 
power to permit Wireless 2016 to take place in the Park.   

46.  On  a  proper  analysis  of  the  legislative  provisions,  as  Mr 
Kolvin submits, each of these Acts creates different powers for 
different places subject to different limitations.   

47.  There  is  express  power  under  section  145(2)(a)  to 
‘enclose  or  set  apart’  any  part  of  a  park.    I  agree  with  Mr 
Kolvin  that  ‘enclosing’  an  area  in  a  park  must  mean  or  entail 
closing it to the public, otherwise this would be an unnecessary 
provision.    Sub-sections  (2)(b)  and  (c)  make  clear  that  the 
power includes closing the park in question to members of the 
public,  save  for  those  who  pay  for  admission.    In  any  event 
section  145(1)  confers  on  the  council  an  express  power  to  do 
‘anything’ that is necessary or expedient for the purposes of the 
provision  of  an  entertainment  ‘of  any  nature’.    I  accept  Mr 
Kolvin’s submission that includes closing the Park to the extent 
and  for  the  time  necessary  to  set  up  and  take  down  the  event 
infrastructure,  and  to  hold  the  event  safely  for  the  benefit  of 
those members of the public who wish to buy tickets to attend 
it.  Wireless 2016 is an event that falls within section 145(1)(a) 
and (e).   

replaced  section  132  of 

48.  Section  145 
the  Local 
Government  Act  1948,  which  conferred  a  similar  power  to 
provide, or provide for, entertainment of any nature.  However 
it  is  to  be  noted  that  the  limitation  on  how  much  of  the  park 
may  be  closed  or  set  aside  in  section  132(2)(a)  is  not 
reproduced in section 145 of the 1972 Act.  The specific power 
in section 145(2) is also without any limitation on the period of 
time  during  which  such  enclosure  or  setting  aside  may 
continue.   

49.  Section  145  does  not  state  that  its  exercise  is  subject  to 
any other enactment, or that it is to be read or qualified by any 
such  enactment,  whether  in  London  or  elsewhere  in  England 
and  Wales.    It  applies  to  the  individual  London  boroughs  and 
also, significantly, to the City of London (see sub-section (5)).
--------
Discussion 

I  also  accept  Mr  Kolvin’s  submission  that  the  power 
50. 
contained in section 44 of the 1890 Act is an additional power 
that  an  authority  may  rely  upon  should  it  so  choose.    This  is 
made  clear  by  section  341  of  the  Public  Health  Act  1875….   
Similarly article 7 of the Schedule to the 1967 Act provides the 
Council  with  a  power  in  addition  to  any  other  power  that  it 
possesses (see article 20 of the Schedule).”   

38. 

39. 

Despite  the  submissions  of  Mr  Harwood  and  Mr  Laurence,  I  am  unpersuaded  that 
Supperstone J erred.  Indeed, I am firmly of the view that he was right, for the reasons 
he gave. 

Before  us,  Mr  Harwood  focused  upon  the  proposition  that  section  145  did  not 
authorise the Council to exclude members of the public from the area of the proposed 
festival.    He  contrasted  the  wording  of  section  145(2)(a)  (“a  local  authority  may… 
enclose or set apart any part of a park or pleasure ground…”), with article 7(1)(g) of 
the  1967  Act  (“A  local  authority  may…  set  apart  or  enclose…  any  part  of  the  open 
space and preclude any person from entering that part so set apart or enclosed other 
than a person to whom access is permitted by the local authority” (italics added)).  He 
submitted that the italicised words were crucial: it was those that gave an authority the 
power under article 7 to exclude from an event in a park those who had not paid.  If, 
as Mr Kolvin and Mr McCracken submitted, the power to “set apart and enclose” part 
of  a  park,  and  charge  people  to  go  into  that  part,  necessarily  included  the  power  to 
exclude other members of the public, those italicised words would be otiose in article 
7.    There  is  a  tenet  of  construction  that  Parliament  does  not  use  empty  words  in 
legislation.    They  are  not  empty,  he  submitted,  because,  on  the  true  construction  of 
section 145, the power to “set apart or enclose” land does not incorporate the power to 
exclude people from it.   

40. 

This argument, I admit, had some superficial attraction; but, when the words are seen 
in their full context, I find it unconvincing.   

41.  Mr  Kolvin  and  Mr  McCracken  accepted  that  the  italicised  words  in  article  7  were 
superfluous,  because  the  concept  of  “enclosing  or  setting  apart”  land  inherently 
includes the concept of being able to keep people out of that land once it had been set 
apart  or  enclosed.    That  was  particularly  the  case  here,  where  there  was  a  statutory 
power to charge people for entering the land, a pointless power if, anyway, the public 
could  not  be  prevented  from  entering  the  land  without  paying  anything.    Both 
considered  that  the  otiose  words  were  probably  there  for  historic  reasons,  given  the 
lengthy evolution of article 7. 

In my view, as a matter of ordinary language, “enclosing” an area of land necessarily 
connotes  putting  some  form  of  barrier  round  the  whole  of  that  area,  with  a  view  to 
preventing access  to  and/or egress  from  it.  Mr McCracken cited the example of the 
movement  involving  the  enclosure  of  public  lands  by  private  landowners  for  the 
purposes of cultivation; but, in case that might be regarded as use as a term of art, an 
animal enclosure or a members’ enclosure has the same connotation.  It is difficult to 
think  of  a  use  of  the  word  where  it  does  not  have  that  connotation.    Mr  Harwood 

42.
--------
suggested that something could be “enclosed” even if there were gaps to enable public 
access; but, in my view, such gaps would be inconsistent with the concept. 

43.  Mr Kolvin submitted that the tenet of construction that Parliament does not use otiose 
words  –  i.e.  that  Parliament  intends  that  every  word  used  in  legislation  has  some 
purpose  and  meaning  –  is  weak  in  circumstances  where,  as  here,  there  is  a  long 
history and borrowed phraseology.  That submission has considerable power.   

44.

48. 

However, in this particular case, I consider there may be more than usual grounds for 
caution.  The use of “set apart” and “enclose” in this context appear to have been used 
first in the 1907 Act.  “Set apart” is used in section 76(1)(b) in the context of sports 
pitches:  there  is  provision  to  “set  apart”  a  part  of  the  park  for  that  purpose,  and  “to 
exclude the public from  the part set apart while it  is  in  actual use for that  purpose”.  
“Enclose” is used in a different context, namely for the purpose of protecting ice for 
skating  and  charging  for  the  enclosed  part.    There  is  no  discrete  reference  to  any 
power  to  exclude  persons  from  the  enclosed  area;  although,  from  the  context,  it  is 
clear that such exclusion is necessary and allowed.  Unlike land which is “set apart”, 
the concept of land which is “enclosed” appears there to include the ability to exclude 
the public from that land.  That appears to me to be consistent with the ordinary use of 
the respective words.  It is noteworthy, that section 76(1)(e) of the 1907 Act referred 
to merely “enclose” any part of a park or ground, and did not have an express specific 
power to exclude persons from the part enclosed.  

I accept the strength of support is, at best, modest; and is, perhaps, very modest.  The 
phrases “set apart” and “enclosed” are put together in later statutes – first, it seems, in 
section 42 of the 1935 Act – and, in some, an express power to exclude (or preclude 
the entry of) members of the public is maintained.  Indeed, by section 44 of that Act, a 
local  authority  is  given  the  power  to  “enclose”  any  part  of  any  open  space  “for  the 
purpose  of  or  in  connection  with  the  cultivation  or  preservation  of  vegetation  in  the 
interests of public amenity; or… in the interests of the safety of the public; and may 
preclude any person from entering any part so enclosed”; which reduces the force of 
the point I make.   

In any event, however the phrase “enclose or set apart” came to arrive in section 145 
of the 1972 Act, given that, as a matter of ordinary language, “enclosing” an area of 
land  necessarily  connotes  putting  some  form  of  barrier  round  the  whole  of  that  area 
with  a  view  to  preventing  access  to  and/or  egress  from  it,  in  its  full  context,  in  my 
view, Parliament intended section 145 to give a power to the relevant local authority 
to  exclude  members  of  the  public,  e.g.  those  who  do  not  have  a  ticket  and  have  not 
paid, from that part. 

Two further matters in my view support that conclusion. 

First,  the  1967  Act  does  not  apply  out  of  London.    I  do  not  accept  that  Parliament 
could  sensibly  have  intended  out  of  London  local  authorities  to  have  no  power  to 
restrict access to parts of their parks for the purposes of entertainment (other than the 
power to close parks for a particular public institution or event under section 44 of the 
1890 Act). 

49. 

Second, local statutory provisions, to which we have been referred, generally appear 
to proceed on the basis that a power simply to “enclose” includes a power to restrict
--------
access to the general, non-paying public, and consequently do not include a separate, 
express  power  to  do  so.    For  example,  paragraph  9  of  Schedule  2  to  the  West 
Yorkshire  Act  1980,  under  the  heading  “Power  to  enclose  lakes  for  skating  and  to 
charge for admission”, provides: 

“The  Bradford  council  during  times  of  frost  may  for  the 
purpose  of  protecting  ice  for  skating  on  all  or  any  part  of  any 
lake or piece of water on [Baildon] Moor enclose such parts of 
the  Moor  as  may  be  necessary  to  effect  such  purpose  and 
charge for admission to any part so enclosed.” 

It is clear that that provision allows the relevant local authority to restrict access to the 
area enclosed.  Indeed, that is made the clearer in some local provisions which, whilst 
giving  the  relevant  authority  power  to  enclose  identified  open  space  under  section 
145,  expressly  require  access  to  be  maintained  to  a  particular  part  of  it  (see,  e.g., 
section 5 of the Shrewsbury and Atcham Borough Council Act 1988). 

50.  Mr  Laurence  did  not  support  Mr  Harwood’s  contention  that  the  1972  Act  did  not 
include a power under which a local  authority  could  restrict access  to  part of a park 
etc  used  for  entertainment.    Indeed,  for  the  purposes  of  this  appeal,  his  primary 
submission  was  based  on  the  premise  that,  like  the  1967  Act,  it  did.    He  submitted 
that,  although  the  1967  Act  and  1972  Act  did  not  have  precisely  the  same 
consequences, the two statutes dealt with the same “state of facts”, i.e. the proposed 
enclosure or setting apart of part of a park or pleasure  ground belonging to or under 
the control of a London borough council for the purposes of providing entertainment 
for the public.  In those circumstances, the maxim generalia specialibus non derogant 
(a general provision does not derogate from a special one) applied.  That maxim was 
explained neatly, he submits, in Section 88 of Bennion on Statutory Interpretation: A 
Code (6th Edition) (2013), as follows: 

 “It  may  be  that,  while  a  state  of  facts  falls  within  the  literal 
meaning  of  a  wide  provision,  there  is  in  an  earlier  Act  a 
specific provision obviously intended to cover that state of facts 
in greater detail.  Where the effect of the two enactments is not 
precisely  the  same,  and  the  earlier  one  is  not  expressly 
repealed, it is presumed that Parliament intended it to continue 
to  apply.    The  Earl  of  Selborne  LC  said  [in  Seward  v  The 
Owners of the Vera Cruz (The Vera Cruz) (1884) 10 App Cas 
59 at page 68]: 

‘…  where  there  are  general  words  in  a  later  Act  capable 
of  reasonable  and  sensible  application  without  extending 
them to subjects specially dealt with by earlier legislation, 
you  are  not  to  hold  that  earlier  and  special  legislation 
indirectly  repealed,  altered  or  derogated  from  merely  by 
force  of  such  general  words,  without  any  indication  of  a 
particular intention to do so.’” 

51.  Mr  Laurence  submitted  that,  read  in  context,  the  1967  Act  effectively  provides  a 
comprehensive  regime  for  the  holding  of  entertainments  in  parks  and  pleasure 
grounds in London.  That separate and distinct regime, he submits, has been in place
--------
since the 1935 Act.  He rejects the suggestion that section 132 of the 1948 Act applied 
to  London at  all;  because it too  was general,  and bowed to  the special provisions of 
the  1935  Act.    Of  course,  the  1972  Act  expressly  applies  to  London  (including  the 
City of London); but, he submitted, the 1972 Act confers upon authorities a mass of 
powers  not  covered  by  the  1967  Act  (e.g.  the  provision  of  swimming  baths  etc).  
Given that the 1972 Act was passed only five  years after the 1967 Act,  the “glaring 
contradiction” between the explicit spatial  limitation  in  article 7  and the lack of any 
such limitation  in  section 145  can only be explained by such  a construction.   Had it 
been intended that the former should be made redundant, it is inconceivable that the 
draftsman would not have made that clear. 

52. 

In my view, this was the most powerful argument against the construction of section 
145  pressed  by  the  Council,  skilfully  put  by  Mr  Laurence;  but,  again,  I  have  been 
ultimately unpersuaded.  It is based on the premise that Parliament intended article 7 
of  the  1967  Act  to  be  specifically  directed  towards  the  holding  of  entertainments  in 
parks  and  pleasure  grounds  in  London  to  the  extent  that  it  can  be  assumed  that 
Parliament  intended  that  section  145  of  the  1972  Act,  that  would  otherwise  apply, 
should not apply to London.  That is a premise I cannot accept. 

local  government  reorganisation 

The 1967 Act,  and the provisional Order that preceded it, were adopted  after 
the 
to  secure 
“uniformity  in  the  law  applicable  with  respect  to  parks  and  open  spaces”.  
There is nothing to suggest that it was intended to effect any radical change. 

in  London,  expressly 

It  is  also  noteworthy  that  section  145(3)  of  the  1972  Act  expressly  retains 
private covenants and conditions upon which a gift of a public park has been 
made;  but  remains  silent  about  the  rights  of  the  public  to  enjoy  the  park  and 
the proviso (ii) in article 7(1) of the 1967 Act. 

The  1972  Act  is,  of  course,  the  later  statute.    Section  145  of  it  applies  to  all 
local authorities, which include all 32 London borough councils (section 270).  
It  is  especially  clear  that  the  draftsman  intended  section  145  to  apply  to 
London  because  (a)  section  145(5)  expressly  includes  the  City  of  London 
within  its  scope,  and  (b)  it  is  clear  that,  where  the  draftsman  intended  to 
exclude London, he did so, as in the immediately previous section (see section 
144(3)).  Section 145 also expressly includes the power to enclose (and, hence, 
restrict  general  public  access  to)  any  part  of  a  park  or  pleasure  ground.    It  is 
clear that it is intended to give power to enclose any part of a park in London 
for  the  purposes  of  “an  entertainment  of  any  nature”,  which  includes  music 
festivals. 

The  1890  Act  provides  a  specific  power  to  close  a  public  park  or  pleasure 
ground for a limited number of days for any charitable or other public purpose.  
It  is  not  suggested  that  that  is  a  special  provision  which  trumps  the  general 
power  in  the  1972  Act.    In  respect  of  the  1967  Act  and  the  1972  Act, 
Supperstone  J  concluded  that,  as  Mr  Kolvin  submitted  before  him  and  this 
court, article 7 and section 145 are stand alone provisions, creating “different 
powers for different places subject to different limitations” (see [46]).  I agree.  
The  1972  Act  is  restricted  in  its  scope  to  parks  and  pleasure  grounds;  whilst 
the  1967  Act  applies  to “open  space”  which  is  defined  much  more  widely  to 
include,  not  only  those,  but  also  heaths,  commons,  walks,  and  disused  burial

grounds.    The  1972  Act  is  specifically  focused  on  “entertainment”  of  a 
performing  kind;  whilst  the  1967  Act  has  within  its  scope  a  much  wider 
variety  of  facilities  for  public  entertainment,  including  swimming  baths,  golf 
courses, gymnasia, swings and other such apparatus, and centres and facilities 
for  clubs  and  other  organisations.    The  whole  focus  of  these  two  (indeed, 
three) statutes is different.  I do not accept the submission that the two sets of 
provisions  “conflict”:  they  are,  in  my  view,  simply  separate  and  distinct 
powers,  subject  to  different  criteria  and  restrictions. 
  That  seriously 
undermines  the  contention  that  the  1967  Act  was  a  special  provision  for  the 
same  “state  of  facts”  as  those  for  which  the  1972  Act  provided.    It  is 
insufficient for the application of the maxim – and, hence, the assumption that 
the  Parliamentary  intention  was  to  deny  London  boroughs  the  powers  in 
relation  to  entertainment  in  parks  provided  by  the  1972  Act  –  that  there  was 
merely some overlap. 

Indeed, far from suggesting that the 1967 Act excluded powers which, on the 
face of it, were given to London boroughs in respect of entertainment in parks, 
the  various  statutes  expressly  provide  that  the  powers  they  give  are 
supplementary to any powers derived from other Acts (see, especially, article 
20  of  the  1967  Act).    In  my  view,  that  is  a  clear  flag  of  the  intention  of 
Parliament. 

Section  145  replaced  section  132  of  the  1948  Act.    Insofar  as  out  of  London 
authorities are concerned, it removed the spatial restriction imposed by section 
132(2)(a)  of  the  1948  Act  on  the  power  to  enclose  or  set  apart  any  part  of  a 
park  (i.e.  the  greater  of  one  acre  or  one  tenth  of  the  area  of  the  park).    Of 
course, one can see why the extension of powers in respect of a particular area 
may be appropriate: I have referred to  some such local extensions.  But there 
does  not  appear  to  be  a  logical  reason  why  London  boroughs  should  be 
deprived of the powers which non-London local authorities have in respect of 
entertainment  in  parks  under  section  145.    Mr  Harwood  suggested  that  there 
might be a rationale in the population density in London and/or the size of the 
capital,  but  there  is  nothing  to  suggest  that  Parliament  had  that  in  mind  as  a 
reason to reduce the powers in London.   

v)

vii) 

I do not accept Mr Laurence’s submission that the provisions of section 42 of 
the 1935 Act were, so far as London is concerned, specialia to the provisions 
of section 132 of the 1948 Act’s generalia, so that the latter did not  apply to 
London  either.    For  the  same  reasons,  I  consider  those  two  statutes  gave 
London authorities two distinct powers, under either of which they could have 
acted in particular circumstances. 

For  those  reasons,  I  do  not  consider  that  Mr  Laurence  (or,  insofar  as  he  made  a 
supporting  submission,  Mr  Harwood)  can  obtain  any  significant  support  for  the 
contention that Parliament intended that section 145 of the 1972 Act should not apply 
to London from the maxim.   

Indeed, I am satisfied that that was not Parliament’s intention; but, rather, that section 
145 provides the Council power to enclose part of the Park for the purposes of events 
such as the Wireless Festival, entirely distinct and separate from the power in article 

 

53. 

54.
--------
7, such that the Council can, in any particular circumstances, exercise either power it 
chooses.  The power under section 44 of the 1890 Act is, likewise, distinct. 

55.  Mr Laurence and Mr Harwood relied upon other submissions based upon the rights of 
the  public  to  have  free  and  unrestricted  access  to  the  park,  under  the  statutory  trust 
established now by section 10 of the 1906 Act.  Mr Laurence submitted that the power 
under section 145 to enclose part of a park has to be construed, so far as possible, in 
the  light  of  that  statutory  trust,  which  imposes  a  primary  obligation  on  the  Council.  
Where Parliament has given an authority to do things which may potentially interfere 
with  the  free  and  unrestricted  use  by  the  general  public  of  parks,  then,  relying  on 
Blake v Hendon Corporation [1962] 1 QB 283, Mr Laurence submits they “are to be 
construed (if possible, which it is) as conferring powers that are to be exercised in a 
way that is consistent with and ancillary to “beneficial occupation by the public” and 
“compatible  with  the  full  use  by  the  public  of  [the  land]  as  [a  public  park  or]  as  a 
pleasure  ground”.    That,  he  says,  informs  “the  correct  approach  to  the  interpretation 
and application” of section 145. 

56. 

There  is  here,  I  consider,  room  for  confusion.    This  appeal  concerns  the  issue  of 
whether, as a matter of jurisdiction, the Council had power under section 145 to hire 
out part of the Park for the purposes of the Wireless Festival; or whether, as a matter 
of  jurisdiction,  they  were  limited  to  considering  the  application  for  hire  only  under 
section  44  of  the  1890  Act  or  article  7  of  the  1967  Act.    In  respect  of  that  issue,  it 
seems to me that that the statutory trust provisions of section 10 of the 1906 Act are of 
limited value, because section 145 clearly gives local authorities the power to enclose 
parts of a park that is subject to that trust: the issue is whether it applies to London, 
and  hence  the  Park.    Of  course,  if  the  Council  has  the  power  to  consider  the 
application  under  section  145,  they  must  use  that  power  lawfully,  and  not  (e.g.)  to 
frustrate  the  legislative  purpose  (Padfield  v  Minister  of  Agriculture  Fisheries  and 
Food [1968] AC 997) or perversely (Associated Provincial Picture Houses Limited v 
Wednesbury Corporation [1948] 1 KB 223).  But  that is  a different  and highly fact-
specific  question,  which  involves  an  assessment  of  the  various  rights  and  interests 
involved – quintessentially a question for the democratically-elected Council, subject 
to  control  by  the  courts  on  well-established  principles  of  judicial  review  –  and  one 
that does not arise in this appeal.  There is no challenge to the Council’s exercise of 
the  section  145  power  in  this  case,  if  it  had  such  a  power;  and,  consequently,  no 
evidence has been lodged by the Council in respect of it.  Given the consultation and 
other  processes  that  went  into  the  Council’s  policy  on  events  in  the  park  generally, 
and its decision to grant Festival Republic a premises licence and Live Nation a hiring 
of part of the Park for the festival, it may be that such a challenge would have been 
difficult  to  mount  or  even  untenable;  but,  as  no  such  challenge  has  been  made,  it 
would be inappropriate to say anything further about it. 

Conclusion 

57. 

For those reasons, I would dismiss this appeal.

Orders are sought in the nature of certiorari and mandamus. 2    The grounds upon which the applicant relies can be summarised as follows:(a)    the Minister failed to give primary consideration to the best interests of the applicant’s child;(b)    the Minister denied the applicant procedural fairness by not providing notice that the decision would not give primary consideration to the best interests of the applicant’s child,(together, primary consideration ground);(c)    the Minister considered the serious nature of the offences for which the applicant had been punished as a stand-alone consideration (irrelevant consideration ground);  and(d)    the decision to cancel the applicant’s visa (original decision) was invalid as s 501(3A) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (Act) (the provision conferring the mandatory cancellation power) is invalid as conferring judicial power on the Minister, contrary to Chapter III of the Constitution (Falzon ground).3    These reasons do not deal with the Falzon ground, which is a contention the subject of consideration by the High Court in a proceeding heard on 14 November 2017 and, in respect of which, judgment is reserved: see Falzon v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2017] HCATrans 230.  In this circumstance, I determined that the hearing proceed on the argument in relation to the primary consideration and irrelevant consideration grounds, and that disposition of the Falzon ground await the High Court’s judgment.4    A further preliminary matter should be mentioned.  Throughout the material before the Court, reference is made to the applicant’s ‘minor relatives’, including in the statement of reasons for the non-revocation decision (Minister’s reasons).  Notwithstanding a reference to other minor relatives in the grounds specified in the application, it became evident during oral submissions that the parties accept that in the context of this proceeding, the focal point legally is the applicant’s daughter (T 3-4), which is consistent with art 3 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child which does not extend to non-parental or non-guardian relationships or to circumstances where a person is not legally responsible for a child; it was not suggested that the applicant was a parent or legal guardian to, or otherwise legally responsible for, any other child.  Accordingly, insofar as the interests of any children are concerned, it is common ground that the Minister, in making the non-revocation decision, was only required to give primary consideration to the best interests of the applicant’s daughter.5    I turn now to the relevant factual background.B    FACTUAL BACKGROUND & THE non-revocation DECISION 6    The applicant is a citizen of New Zealand who arrived in Australia in 1983 as a child and has lived here since. He was granted the visa the subject of the original decision in 2002.  Unhappily, his wife suffers from muscular dystrophy, as a consequence of which she requires support from the applicant and their 12 year-old daughter.7    In January 2015, the applicant was convicted of committing an act of indecency.  The ignominious details of this incident are unnecessary to recount.  Later that year, he was convicted of two counts of common assault and contravening an apprehended domestic violence order.  These offences were all committed against his wife.  He was sentenced for both sets of offences.  In March 2016, he successfully appealed the sentence imposed and was re-sentenced to 16 months’ imprisonment.8    In April 2016, a delegate of the Minister notified the applicant of the original decision, made pursuant to s 501(3A) of the Act.  The notification confirmed that the Minister was satisfied that the applicant did not pass the character test on the basis of his substantial criminal record, and that his visa had been cancelled.  The notification went on to explain that the original decision could be revoked and invited the applicant to make representations.  It continued: How to make representations about revocation of the decision to cancel your visa…Under s499 of the Act which permits the Minister to issue written directions about the exercise of powers under the Act, the Minister has issued Direction 65 – Visa refusal and cancellation under s501 and revocation of a mandatory cancellation of a visa under s501CA which identifies issues that are relevant to the revocation consideration. A copy of Direction 65 is enclosed for your information. You should address each paragraph in Part C of the Direction that is relevant to your circumstances.…If…the Minister makes a revocation decision personally, he or she is not bound by Direction 65, although Direction 65 provides a broad indication of the types of issues that the Minister is likely to take into account in deciding whether or not to revoke the decision to cancel your visa.(uncorrected, original bolding, underlining and italics)9    Later that month, the applicant requested a revocation of the original decision.  Between April 2016 and February 2017, the applicant made representations and representations were also made by others (including the applicant’s wife, who described the difficulties that would be occasioned by the applicant’s absence).10    In order to obtain some appreciation of the structure and content of the Minister’s reasons for the non-revocation decision, it is regrettably necessary to quote parts of those reasons at some length, starting with the discussion under the heading “Best interests of minor children”:13. In considering whether or not I am satisfied that there is another reason why the original decision should be revoked, I acted in conformity with Article 3 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, and treated the best interests of any affected children under 18 in Australia as a primary consideration and have concluded that it is in the best interests of [the applicant’s] daughter for the [original decision] to be revoked.…15. [The applicant] states that he speaks with [his daughter] on a daily basis and that she visits him in detention at least twice a week. He submits that [his daughter] needs his support and that non-revocation of the [original decision] would burden her with the day to day care of her mother who suffers Muscular Dystrophy.16. [The applicant’s wife] states that [the applicant] is a good father. [His daughter] misses him and cries regularly. [The applicant’s wife] submits that [the applicant’s daughter] should be focussing on her education, enjoying time with her friends and playing sport instead of being weighed down with the caring responsibilities of her mother.17. I acknowledge [the applicant’s daughter’s] young age. She is 12 years old and has recently started high school. I recognise that [the applicant’s daughter] is under a significant amount of pressure having assumed the caring responsibilities for her mother. I note that [the applicant’s wife] is under significant financial pressure to provide for [the applicant’s daughter] and that [the applicant’s daughter’s] wellbeing is most likely impacted. I find that [the applicant’s] presence would alleviate many of the physical and financial pressure on [the applicant’s daughter] as he was the main provider for the family. 18. I have considered the comments of…[the applicant’s] in-laws, that [the applicant’s] presence in Australia will provide [his daughter] with the love and support she needs.19. I accept that [the applicant’s daughter] will be disadvantaged by a decision not to revoke the [original decision] and therefore will continue to bear a lot of the caring responsibilities for her mother. I also accept that [the applicant] maintains a close relationship with his daughter and that his presence is important for her development. However, I note with some concern that [the applicant’s daughter] was exposed to his most recent, and most serious, offending. I have particular regard to the Magistrates (sic) remarks of 22 January 2015 that [the applicant’s] actions would change [the applicant’s daughter’s] attitude towards her father for the worse, and that his role was to nurture and protect [his daughter] and provide her with stability given her mother’s declining health.20. I recognise that [the applicant’s] capacity to be a positive influence on [his daughter] depends on his ability to manage his alcohol problems and avoid further incidents of domestic violence and acts of indecency. Although [the applicant’s] actions exposed [his daughter] to events that will have a long lasting psychological and emotional impact on her, I nevertheless find that it is in [the applicant’s daughter’s] best interests for the [original decision] to be revoked.11    Having found that if the original decision was not revoked, the applicant’s wife and daughter may face emotional, physical and financial hardship; that other members of the applicant’s family were likely to experience emotional hardship; and that impediments the applicant would face if removed were broadly neutral, the Minister’s reasons continued:Protecting the Australian Community34. In coming to my decision about whether or not there is another reason why the original decision should be revoked I have had regard to the consideration of the protection of the Australia community, noting in particular [the applicant’s] claim that he is rehabilitated and will not reoffend. I considered the government’s commitment to protecting the Australian community from harm as a result of criminal activity by non-citizens.Criminal conduct35. In considering the nature and seriousness of [the applicant’s] criminal offending I note that violent offences are very serious.12    The Minister’s reasons then turned to the applicant’s offending in detail over several paragraphs, before continuing:42. The seriousness of [the applicant’s] offending has increased over the years, culminating with his most recent sentence of 16 months (sic) imprisonment. Dispositions involving incarceration of the offender are the last resort in the sentencing hierarchy and I have considered that the court viewed [the applicant’s] most recent offending as serious.43. Having regard to his offending history, and the remarks and dispositions of the court, I adopt the judicial observations of the court and form the view that overall, [the applicant’s] offending is serious.Risk to the Australian community…13    The Minister proceeded to consider mitigating circumstances and submissions in support of the applicant’s claims of rehabilitation, before continuing:49. In assessing the likelihood of [the applicant] reoffending, I have had particular regard to the persistent nature of his offending, particularly that involving domestic violence. [The applicant’s] criminal history shows a propensity of breaching conditional release orders. I find that his actions demonstrate a lack of regard to judicial orders. I also recognise that apprehended violence orders, fines, community service orders and a suspended sentence failed to curb [the applicant’s] offending and ultimately led to him being imprisoned. I consider this weighs toward a likelihood of him reoffending.50. I have considered the comments of the court concerning the nature of the harm caused by [the applicant’s] offending, in particular the long term impact his actions will have on [his daughter]. I find that there remains a likelihood that [the applicant’s daughter] could be exposed to further offending by [the applicant]. Should [the applicant] reoffend in a similar manner, I find that there is a risk that he may cause further emotional and/or psychological harm to [his daughter].51. In light of [the applicant’s] sustained criminal record, the trend toward more serious offending, and the untested nature of his rehabilitation, I find that there is an ongoing likelihood of him reoffending. Should [the applicant] re-offend in a similar manner in the future, I find that there is a risk that he could cause further physical and/or psychological harm to [his wife], [his daughter] or to members of the Australian community.CONCLUSION52. I considered all relevant matters including (1) an assessment of whether the person has made representations…; (2) an assessment of whether I am satisfied that the person passes the character test…; (3) an assessment of whether I am satisfied that there is another reason why the original decision should be revoked…; and (4) all evidence available to me, including evidence provided by, or on behalf of, [the applicant].53. I concluded [the applicant] has made representations…54. I am not satisfied that [the applicant] passes the character test… 55. In considering, in light of [the applicant’s] representations, whether I was satisfied that there is another reason why the [original decision] should be revoked, I gave primary consideration to the best interests of [the applicant’s] daughter and other minor relatives and have found that their best interest would be served by the revocation of the [original decision].56. In addition, I have considered the length of time [the applicant] has made a positive contribution to the Australian community, some 33 years and the consequences of my decision for his other family members.57. On the other hand, in considering whether I was satisfied that there is another reason why the [original decision] should be revoked, I gave significant weight to the serious nature of the crimes committed by [the applicant], in particular those relating to domestic violence and indecency, noting that the victim was his wife and vulnerable due to her disability.58. Further, I find that the Australian community could be exposed to great harm should [the applicant] reoffend in a similar fashion. I could not rule out the possibility of further offending by [the applicant].59. I am aware that where great harm could be inflicted on the Australian community even other strong countervailing considerations may be insufficient for me to revoke the [original decision], even applying a higher tolerance of criminal conduct by [the applicant], than I otherwise would, because he has lived in Australia for most of his life and from a very young age.60. In reaching my decision about whether I am satisfied that there is another reason why the [original decision] should be revoked, I concluded that [the applicant] represents an unacceptable risk of harm to the Australian community and that the protection of the Australian community outweighed the best interests of his daughter…as a primary consideration, and any other considerations as described above. These include his lengthy residence and bonds, employment history, the hardship to his wife and other family and social networks will endure in the event the original decision is not revoked.C    PARTIES’ CONTENTIONSC.1    Primary consideration ground14    The applicant’s first contention is that the Minister’s reasons treated the protection of the Australian community as the primary consideration to be displaced, or as “inherently more significant” than the best interests of the applicant’s child, drawing on the discussion by Mortimer J in Murad v Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2017] FCAFC 73 (Murad appeal) at [72]-[74].  In aid of this contention, the applicant points to the position of [59] immediately before the conclusion at [60], and the syntax of [59] as elevating the protection of the Australian community to sole importance.15    Secondly, it was asserted the Minister’s reasons merely cite competing considerations and do not include any form of assessment or weighing of the considerations as required by Wan v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 568; (2001) 107 FCR 133 at 142 [32] per Branson, North and Stone JJ.  The applicant submitted that there was no explicit indication of the weight afforded to the considerations, except for the “significant weight” afforded to the serious nature of the offending (at [57] of the Minister’s decision).  It was said that the underlying logic of the non-revocation decision as demonstrated by the Minister’s reasons was said to be a “triple hypothetical”:…being a likely (not probable) risk that the applicant could reoffend, and, if he did, it could expose people to harm) outweighed multiple certain and definite considerations (including, that the best interests of the applicant’s child was for the [original decision] to be revoked).(original underlining)16    The applicant pointed to the absence in [55], [56] and [58] of the Minister’s reasons of any description of the weight afforded the considerations there discussed.  This was to be contrasted with the explicit description in [57] of the “significant weight” afforded to the serious nature of the applicant’s offending (T 11-2).  The argument was “that even though there has been an identification properly of the considerations and no failure caused by taking into account irrelevant considerations, there has been an insufficient demonstration that there has been a weighing process and an assessment process, both individually and cumulatively” (T 14).17    In response, as to the first of these matters, the Minister contends the applicant’s argument is misconceived, as [59] is simply a statement of policy; as to the second, contrary to the applicant’s contention, the Minister engaged in a careful analysis of the applicant’s daughter’s best interests and identified that revocation of the original decision was in her best interests.  It was further submitted that the Minister’s reasoning was pellucid: he considered that the applicant posed a great risk to the community and this outweighed the other considerations he had earlier carefully analysed and identified.  Overall, the Minister contends that the applicant’s analysis divorces what was explained at [60] from the balance of the Minister’s reasons read as a whole.C.2    Irrelevant consideration ground18    This contention has two aspects: the first is that the serious nature of the applicant’s offending was a “stand-alone” or sole consideration, which was given “significant weight”.  This is evinced by the lengthy recitation of the applicant’s offending, without identifying its relevance or link to protecting the Australian community or other permissible considerations.  In oral submissions (T 73-4), it was submitted that a further revelation of the focus on the serious nature of the applicant’s offending was a letter dated 17 February 2017 (Court book page 45), which invited comments regarding additional material received by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection.19    The second aspect is that to treat the serious nature of the offending as a stand-alone consideration was necessarily an irrelevant consideration because the otherwise broad discretion must necessarily be confined to exclude considerations of a punitive character, a proposition flowing from the imperative that punishment of criminal guilt is reserved exclusively to courts exercising judicial power. 20    It follows from the first and second aspects of the argument that a stand-alone consideration of the seriousness of the offending would be an irrelevant consideration as it constitutes a decision not to revoke the original decision because an individual has committed serious offending.  The stand-alone consideration of the seriousness of the offending without explanation of its relevance to other considerations was tantamount (so the argument went) to another sentencing.21    In response, the Minister contends that his summation of the material was appropriate and that although significant weight was placed on the seriousness of the applicant’s offending, this formed part of a rational process of reasoning which led to the evaluative conclusion that the applicant posed a risk of “great harm” to the Australian community and that this risk was “unacceptable”. 22    Further, it is said that the applicant ignores the fact that the Minister’s reasoning broadly follows the structure of Direction 65 (being a direction issued by the Minister in accordance with s 499(1) of the Act, which provides that the Minister “may give written directions to a person or body having functions or powers under this Act if the directions are about the performance of those functions or the exercise of those powers”).  The preamble to Direction 65 relevantly provides:6.2 General Guidance(1) The Government is committed to protecting the Australian community from harm as a result of criminal activity or other serious conduct by non-citizens. The principles below are of critical importance in furthering that objective, and reflect community values and standards with respect to determining whether the risk of future harm from a non-citizen is unacceptable.…6.3 Principles…(4) In some circumstances, criminal offending or other conduct, and the harm that would be caused if it were to be repeated, may be so serious, that any risk of similar conduct in the future is unacceptable. In these circumstances, even other strong countervailing considerations may be insufficient to justify not cancelling or refusing the visa.(5) In some circumstances, criminal offending or other conduct, and the harm that would be caused if it were to be repeated, may be so serious, that any risk of similar conduct in the future is unacceptable. In these circumstances, even other strong countervailing considerations may be insufficient to justify not cancelling or refusing the visa.23    Relevantly, in respect of revocation requests, Part C of Direction 65 provides:13. Primary considerations – revocation requests…(2) In deciding whether to revoke the mandatory cancellation of a non-citizen’s visa, the following are primary considerations:a) Protection of the Australian community from criminal and other serious conduct;b) The best interests of minor children in Australia;c) Expectations of the Australian community.13.1 Protection of the Australian community(1) When considering protection of the Australian community, decision­makers should have regard to the principle that the Government is committed to protecting the Australian community from harm as a result of criminal activity or other serious conduct by non-citizens. Remaining in Australia is a privilege that Australia confers on non­citizens in the expectation that they are, and have been, law abiding, will respect important institutions, and will not cause or threaten harm to individuals or the Australian community. Mandatory cancellation without notice of certain non-citizen prisoners is consistent with this principle by ensuring that serious offenders remain in either criminal or immigration detention while their immigration status is resolved.(2) Decision-makers should also give consideration to:a) The nature and seriousness of the non-citizen's conduct to date; andb) The risk to the Australian community should the non-citizen commit further offences or engage in other serious conduct.13.1.1 The nature and seriousness of the conduct(1) In considering the nature and seriousness of the non-citizen's criminal offending or other conduct to date, decision-makers must have regard to factors including:…13.1.2 The risk to the Australian community should the non-citizen commit further offences or engage in other serious conduct(1) In considering whether the non-citizen represents an unacceptable risk of harm to individuals, groups or institutions in the Australian community, decision-makers should have regard to the principle that the Australian community's tolerance for any risk of future harm becomes lower as the seriousness of the potential harm increases. Some conduct and the harm that would be caused if it were to be repeated, is so serious that any risk that it may be repeated may be unacceptable.(2) In considering the risk to the Australian community, decision-makers must have regard to, cumulatively:a) The nature of the harm to individuals or the Australian community should the non-citizen engage in further criminal or other serious conduct; andb) The likelihood of the non-citizen engaging in further criminal or other serious conduct, taking into account available information and evidence on the risk of the non-citizen re-offending (noting that decisions should not be delayed in order for rehabilitative courses to be undertaken).13.2 Best interests of minor children in Australia affected by the decision(1) Decision-makers must make a determination about whether revocation is, or is not, in the best interests of the child.…13.3 Expectations of the Australian community(1) The Australian community expects non-citizens to obey Australian laws while in Australia.  Where a non-citizen has breached, or where there is an unacceptable risk that they will breach this trust or where the non-citizen has been convicted of offences in Australia or elsewhere, it may be appropriate to not revoke the mandatory visa cancellation of such a person.  Non-revocation may be appropriate simply because the nature of the character concerns or offences are such that the Australian community would expect that the person should not hold a visa.  Decision-makers should have due regard to the Government's views in this respect.14. Other considerations – revocation requests(1) In deciding whether to revoke the mandatory cancellation of a visa, other considerations must be taken into account where relevant. These considerations include (but are not limited to):a) International non-refoulement obligations;b) Strength, nature and duration of ties;c) Impact on Australian business interests;d) Impact on victims;e) Extent of impediments if removed.…24    As is evident from its terms, as the Minister submits, Direction 65 was not binding upon him (see Picard v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2015] FCA 1430 at [41] per Tracey J).  Its present relevance is that the structure of the Minister’s reasons reveals that he exercised his discretion broadly in accordance with Direction 65 (T 34-5, 44).  In responding to the applicant’s submission that the seriousness of the applicant’s offending sits like an “oasis” in the Minister’s reasons (T 43), the Minister’s contention is that, consistently with the structure of Direction 65, he considered the question of “risk” with the question of “seriousness” of offending under the overall consideration of “protecting” the Australian community; that is, that he did not only consider the seriousness of the applicant’s offending.  25    Finally, it is contended that the applicant’s irrelevant consideration ground confuses an “impermissible purpose” in the exercise of power with an “impermissible consideration” taken into account when exercising that power.D    CONSIDERATIOND.1    Preliminary Matters and Context 26    At the outset it worth emphasising a well-established and important proposition: it is not the role of this Court to subject the Minister’s reasons to a process of parsing akin to deconstructing a haiku.  As was noted in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 272 per Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ: …a court should not be concerned with looseness in the language...nor with unhappy phrasing of the reasons of an administrative decision-maker. The reasons for the decision under review are not to be construed minutely and finely with an eye keenly attuned to the perception of error. These propositions are well settled. They recognise the reality that the reasons of an administrative decision-maker are meant to inform and not to be scrutinised upon over-zealous judicial review by seeking to discern whether some inadequacy may be gleaned from the way in which the reasons are expressed.(citations omitted)27    These important observations have present force as I consider that the applicant’s careful analysis of the Minister’s reasons tended, at times, to invite minute construction with an eye attuned to error rather than a fair contextual reading.  It is convenient to identify two of these contextual matters to be kept in mind before turning to the applicant’s arguments in more detail.28    The first is the broad nature of the discretion being exercised.  Section 501CA of the Act provides relevantly:(1) This section applies if the Minister makes a decision (the original decision) under subsection 501(3A) (person serving sentence of imprisonment) to cancel a visa that has been granted to a person.…(4) The Minister may revoke the original decision if: (a) the person makes representations in accordance with the invitation; and(b) the Minister is satisfied:(i) that the person passes the character test (as defined by section 501); or(ii) that there is another reason why the original decision should be revoked.29    The second matter is the presently non-binding guide provided as to the exercise of the broad discretion, being Direction 65, which provides some additional context as to the structure apparently adopted in the Minister’s reasons in discussion of the various considerations.30    I now to turn to the disposition of the three grounds advanced at this initial hearing.D.2    Primary consideration ground31    This ground is not made out for a number of reasons.32    First, the Minister expressly identified that he “treated the best interests of any affected children” as “a primary consideration” and in that context had concluded that “it is in the best interests of [the applicant’s] daughter that for the [original decision] to be revoked” (see [13] of the Minister’s reasons).  The reasons identify only one consideration as “primary”, namely the best interests of the applicant’s daughter; none of the other considerations are designated as “primary”.  Although each case must turn on its own facts, I consider the present circumstances to be stronger than those considered in Murad v Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2016] FCA 876.  In Murad, the only consideration designated as “primary” was that of the applicant’s children and the word “primary” was used only once in the relevant statement of reasons; importantly, the word “primary” was not used in the conclusion of the reasons.  Despite the absence of further reference to the best interests of the children being “primary”, Bromwich J did not accept that repetition was indispensable in the context of the reasons read as a whole (see [49]-[51]).  Here, the Minister found unequivocally that it was in the best interests of the applicant’s daughter to revoke the original decision (at [13] and [20]) and there is further textual indication in [55] and [60] of the treatment of the applicant’s daughter’s best interests as a “primary” consideration in the course of the conclusionary weighing exercise.  In my opinion, this satisfies the requirement that the Minister first identify the best interests of the child before carrying out the weighing exercise: Wan at 140 [26] per Branson, North and Stone JJ.33    Secondly, I do not consider that consideration of the protection of the Australian community distracted the Minister from giving primary consideration to the best interests of the applicant’s daughter.  True it is that considering [59] of the Minister’s reasons in isolation could indicate that that consideration was identified as the consideration to be outweighed.  I accept the submission of the Minister that the reasons, read as a whole, demonstrate that the considerations in the applicant’s favour were considered first.  Thus, the Minister concluded, as “a primary consideration”, that revocation of the original decision was in the applicant’s daughter’s best interests.  I pause to note that I did mention during the hearing the logical difficulty in using the word “primary” as encompassing the plural (as is suggested by the use of an indefinite rather than definite article), but this grammatical curiosity is well-established in this area of discourse: see United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, art 3; Wan at 142 per Branson, North and Stone JJ.34    In any event, the Minister accepted that revocation was in the applicant’s daughter’s best interests and the likely hardship faced by the applicant’s family, and considered the positive contribution of applicant’s employment history.  Thereafter, the Minister considered the issue of the nature and extent of any impediments if removed as, broadly, neutral, before considering the factors which ultimately weighed against the applicant, namely the protection of the Australian community, which itself was informed by the consideration of the serious nature of his offending and the risk to the Australian community. 35    In particular, the concluding paragraphs of the Minister’s reasons fall against the applicant’s contentions.  It is significant to note the use of the word “assessment” in [52] in relation to the factors informing the “relevant matters” considered by the Minister.  This “assessment” is illustrated in the following paragraphs where the “primary consideration” of the best interests of the applicant’s child favouring revocation of the original decision ([55]), “in addition” to the positive contribution made to the Australian community and the consequences of the decision for his other family members ([56]) was weighed (“on the other hand” ([57])) against the significant weight afforded to the serious nature of the applicant’s offending and the “further” finding ([58]) that the Australian community could be exposed to great harm.36    While perhaps infelicitously positioned in the reasons, I accept the Minister’s submission that [59] is consistent with, although as an amalgam of several aspects of, the principles expressed in Direction 65 (partly extracted at [22] above).37    Provided that the Minister did give primary consideration to the best interests of the applicant’s daughter, he was entitled to conclude, after a proper consideration of the material before him, that the strength of other considerations outweighed the first consideration: Wan 142 [32] per Branson, North and Stone JJ.  I am not satisfied that [59] establishes that consideration of the protection of the Australian community overwhelmed the principled exercise of the Minister’s discretion, including the necessity to give primary consideration to the best interests of the applicant’s daughter.  The words “I am aware” indicate a self-direction that following the “assessment” of the considerations, including the best interests of the child as “a” primary consideration, the strength of the other considerations may outweigh the best interests of the applicant’s daughter understood as a primary consideration.  My conclusion in that regard is bolstered in the use of the indefinite formulation which expressed that countervailing considerations “may be insufficient”, rather than a more conclusionary formulation.  Further, reading the Minister’s reasons fairly and as a whole, I do not accept that the positioning of [59] immediately before the conclusion at [60] supports the applicant’s contention (compare Murad appeal at [73]-[76] per Mortimer J).  38    Thirdly, on a fair reading, I do not accept that the Minister’s reasons insufficiently demonstrate a weighing process.  I have already expressed my view of the textual reading of the conclusionary paragraphs at [35]-[37] above.  As noted above, the applicant contends that the presence of the words “significant weight” in [57], and their corresponding absence from [55], [56] and [58], necessarily indicates an absence of weighing.  It is further contended that the word “further” in [58] cannot be read as linking “could not rule out the possibility of further offending” with “significant weight” (T 11-2). 39    With respect, this granular analysis descends to the level warned against in Wu Shan Liang.  Moreover, it does not reflect the usual process of decision-making.  As Gleeson CJ observed in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte S20/2002 [2003] HCA 30; (2003) 198 ALR 59 at 63 [14]:Decision-makers commonly express their reasons sequentially; but that does not mean that they decide each factual issue in isolation from the others. Ordinarily they review the whole of the evidence, and consider all issues of fact, before they write anything. Expression of conclusions in a certain sequence does not indicate a failure to consider the evidence as a whole.40    It is significant that the Minister at [60] expressly states that the conclusion that the applicant represented an unacceptable risk to the Australian community “outweighed” the primary consideration (that is the finding expressed at [13], [20] and [55]) that a revocation of the original decision was in the applicant’s daughter’s best interests.  Read in the context of an earlier reference to “significant weight”, the Minister did weigh the considerations, albeit without expressly assigning weight to some of them.41    Fourthly, given that I have concluded that the best interests of the applicant’s child was a primary consideration in the non-revocation decision, the legitimate expectation aspect of the applicant’s case must be rejected.D.3    Irrelevant considerations ground42    I do not consider that this ground is made out for at least four reasons.43    First, insofar as it is said that the invitation to comment on the additional material received by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection (see [18] above) demonstrates a process whereby the decision-making focused on the serious nature of the offences (T 74), I disagree.  That letter must be read in the context of calling for the applicant’s comment on “information which has been received and may be taken into account” (Court book at page 45).  There is no suggestion in the letter that the information was determinative.44    Secondly, while it may be accepted that the consideration of the nature of the applicant’s offending occupied a substantial proportion of the reasons, the Minister was entitled to form his own view about the seriousness of the offending based on the objective facts and it was entirely up to the Minister to decide what facts he considered relevant to that issue: see Te Puke v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2015] FCA 398; (2015) 230 FCR 499 at 520 [96] per Wigney J.  45    Thirdly, while it is the case that the nature of the applicant’s offending is considered separately (under the heading “Criminal conduct”) from the risk (under the heading “Risk to the Australian community”), both factors inform the overall consideration under the heading “Protecting the Australian Community”.  The finding at [60] of the “unacceptable risk of harm to the Australian community” cannot be divorced from that structure.  Further, I accept the Minister’s submission that the structure of the Minister’s reasons follows the sequencing of Direction 65 and is consistent with the approach that was foreshadowed to the applicant in the letter partly extracted at [8] above.  Accordingly, the serious nature of the applicant’s offending was considered with, and linked to, the consideration of risk to the Australian community.46    Fourthly, it is plain that the assessment at [58] that “I could not rule out the possibility of further offending” was made following a consideration of the serious nature of the offending and the finding that the Australian community could be exposed to great harm.  Further, the conclusion at [60] of there being an unacceptable risk of harm to the Australian community was said to outweigh the other considerations. Again, the use of the word “outweighed” points to the fact that the seriousness of the offending was not considered in a hermetically sealed box.  There is no textual or contextual indication in the Minister’s reasons that the non-revocation decision was intended as being further punishment.  It follows that the irrelevant considerations ground fails.E    CONCLUSION & ORDERS47    I have not identified jurisdictional error in the non-revocation decision.  Accordingly, grounds 1, 2 and 3 of the application must fail.  In light of the outstanding issue regarding the Falzon ground, I propose to relist the matter for a further case management hearing at 9.30 am on 2 February 2018. 48    Finally, I wish to express my appreciation to Ms Hall who appeared for the applicant and Ms Francois (who led Mr A Edwards) who appeared for the Minister, for the considerable assistance provided by the written and oral presentations of their arguments.I certify that the preceding forty-eight (48) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Lee.Associate:  Dated:    17 November 2017",2017-09-25 00:00:00,Federal Court of Australia
6522860,Ohanian v R [2017] NSWCCA 268,"Judgment


	
	GLEESON JA: I agree with Hamill J.
	
	
	ROTHMAN J: I agree with Hamill J.
	
	
	HAMILL J: Robert Ohanian seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed on him by his Honour Judge Craigie SC in the District Court on 24 March 2017. In relation to one count of supplying a prohibited drug (94.1 grams of “MDA”), the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for four years and five months comprised of a non-parole period of two years and ten months and a balance of term of one year and seven months. The applicant received a reduction in the sentence of 25% for his early plea of guilty. [1]  In sentencing the applicant the sentencing Judge took into account three matters on a Form 1. [2] 
	
	
	Mr Ohanian was caught in the course of a police operation arising from a registered source (RS) approaching the police with information. On 14 May 2015 RS attended the applicant’s premises, was shown 10 ecstasy tablets and provided with two tablets as a sample. On 17 May 2015 the applicant sold a quantity of tablets to RS for $9,500. Another male delivered the tablets to RS. On 24 June 2015, RS’s vehicle was searched and two plastic bags were seized which contained a large number of beige tablets. These were analysed and found to be 94.1 grams of “MDA”. Over the next two weeks or so, there were a number of meetings and electronic communications in which the applicant sought to recover the “outstanding drug debt owed by RS to the offender.” These facts were the basis of the offence upon which the applicant stood to be sentenced. The offence carried a maximum penalty of 15 years.
	
	
	The three offences on the Form 1 arose from events surrounding that offence. The first offence to be taken into account was an offence of supply. The facts were that, in early May 2015, the offender arranged for the supply of 43 grams of MDMA to RS for $9,500. The second offence to be taken into account involved the supply of 1 gram of cocaine to RS. Each of those offences, had they been charged separately, carried the same maximum penalty as the principal offence. The third offence involved the possession of 0.55 grams of MDMA which was found when Mr Ohanian’s vehicle was searched on the day of his arrest.
	
	
	There was no dispute as to the facts of the offences and a document styled “Agreed Facts” was tendered on sentence.
	
	
	The Crown also tendered the applicant’s criminal and custodial history. The applicant was born in April 1982. He was 33 at the time of the offences and 34 when he stood to be sentenced.
	
	
	In 2002 he was placed on a bond without conviction for offences of assaulting and resisting or hindering police officers. In the same year an offence of possessing prohibited drugs was dismissed under s 10. In 2004 he was fined for negligent driving. In 2007 he was fined and placed on a bond for possessing drugs. When he breached that bond he was ordered to serve a sentence of 4 months home detention. He received a further 9 months home detention for possessing drugs in the same year. In 2008 he was fined and disqualified from driving for driving offences. In 2009 he was fined for driving an unregistered and uninsured car and sentenced to 9 months periodic detention for driving whilst disqualified.
	
	
	Finally, and most significantly, in 2013 the applicant was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment with a 2 year non-parole period for an offence of selling a prohibited firearm. The sentencing Judge took into account four other offences being supplying drugs, selling a firearm, dealing with the proceeds of crime and participating in a criminal group.
	
	
	The non-parole period expired on 6 November 2014 and a parole order was made on that date. The offences committed in May and June 2015 constituted a breach of parole. Parole was revoked and the applicant was ordered to serve the balance of the sentence imposed in 2013.
	
	
	The breach of parole was an aggravating feature and the criminal record, while mostly consisting of relatively minor offences, disentitled the offender to very much leniency. The most recent prior offence, and the associated matters taken into account, were extremely serious and demonstrated an escalation of the offender’s involvement in the criminal milieu. The amount of drugs involved in the principal offence on this occasion (94 g) was substantial and approached the commercial quantity applicable for the drug in question (125g). [3]  Considerations such as deterrence and denunciation were bound to play a significant role in the proper exercise of the sentencing exercise.
	
	
	Mr Ohanian tendered two psychological reports in the proceedings. The first, by the psychologist Associate Professor Stephen Woods, concerned the applicant’s personal, psychological and family history and the events leading up to the offending. The second, by a psychologist Annalese Bolton, addressed the impact of the applicant’s incarceration on his wife and young family. The sentencing Judge accepted and acted upon parts of these reports but was not prepared to act on what his Honour described as “controversial” assertions made by Mr Ohanian to Associate Professor Woods. In particular, Judge Craigie did not accept (on balance) an assertion that the applicant committed the offence as a result of duress from criminals who threatened the applicant and his brother as a result of drug debts owed by the brother. The applicant did not give evidence and his version of events in relation to threats and duress was untested and not supported by other evidence. No suggestion was made on the hearing of the application for leave to appeal against sentence that his Honour erred in this regard and it is unnecessary to say any more about it.
	
	
	Associate Professor Woods diagnosed the applicant as suffering from substance use disorder, persistent (early onset) depressive disorder, somatic symptom disorder and features of post-traumatic stress disorder. There was a provisional diagnosis of psychotic disorder (possibly schizoaffective disorder or drug induced psychosis). There was evidence in files maintained by Corrective Services that supported the proposition that Mr Ohanian had “serious mental health issues” and a “history of anxiety and schizophrenia” in relation to which he was “not medicated but stable”.
	
	
	The applicant’s mental health issues arose from a severely dysfunctional childhood. The sentencing Judge accepted that parts of the history provided to Associate Professor Woods was uncontroversial. Mr Ohanian’s father was physically and emotionally abusive and his mother left the marriage to cohabitate with his father’s best friend (“K”) when the applicant was about five. The separation was “intensely acrimonious” and the applicant had little or no contact with his father until he was around 14 years old. Meanwhile, K introduced the applicant and his other brother to drugs at an early age. He provided the applicant with cannabis from the age of just twelve years and continued to encourage him to use that drug throughout his teenage years. By the age of 18 years the applicant had commenced to use other drugs. People frequently came to the house looking for his older brother and issued threats to physically harm members of the family. When he was 19 years old there was a “drive by shooting” at the family home. Both of the applicant’s brothers were also involved in drug use and criminal activity and both were also in gaol.
	
	
	Associate Professor Woods said that the applicant is a “psychologically damaged” and vulnerable individual as a result of the environment in which he was raised. Testing showed that he was “not a particularly intelligent individual” and Mr Woods concluded that “he is inclined to be reactive to major stressors rather than adopt a considered approach”.
	
	
	In spite of the problems identified by Associate Professor Woods, his long term drug abuse and his periods of incarceration the applicant had employment in various labouring and unskilled jobs and at the time of the offences he was employed by his brother in law supplying and delivering truck parts. He was married to a supportive wife and had 4 children aged 9, 8, 4 and 3 years.
	
	
	The impact of the applicant’s criminal conduct and incarceration on his wife and family was detailed in the report of Ms Bolton. The impact was, unsurprisingly, considerable and there was evidence that the children were suffering in the absence of their father. Judge Craigie took this matter into account but was unable to find that the hardship was so extreme or exceptional that it could properly inform the exercise of the sentencing discretion. However, his devotion to his family provided the applicant with a significant motivation to reform and, along with his mental health issues, made his time in custody more onerous.
	
	
	Judge Craigie considered all of these matters in the course of his thoughtful remarks (or judgment) on sentence. His Honour determined that the facts of the offences were of such seriousness that a custodial sentence of some substance was appropriate and rejected a submission that a sentence of less than two years could be imposed thereby entitling the sentencing Court to suspend the sentence. His Honour referred to this (in argument) as an “audacious submission” and one that “simply does not fit any notion of general deterrence”. His Honour also said in argument that such an approach would send “a totally risible message out to the community.”
	
	
	Judge Craigie found special circumstances under s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The special circumstances so identified was  the accumulation of the sentence on the period in custody arising from the applicant’s incarceration following the revocation of his parole. His Honour ordered the sentence to commence on 10 January 2016, which is to say part way through the period the applicant was required to serve as a result of the revocation of parole. Neither party in this Court submitted that this was an erroneous approach and, in my view, it struck an appropriate balance.
	


Ground 1: His Honour erred in concluding that the mitigating effects of the applicant’s dysfunctional upbringing diminished for a mature man who has had ample opportunity to address his difficulties.


	
	Judge Craigie made the following observations that are relevant to the first ground of appeal:
	


“Otherwise, I do regard matters of general background, such as those contained in the report, as uncontroversial and to some degree explanatory of the offender’s criminal history and of his lapse again into offending. The matters including the early and acrimonious separation of his parents when he was aged five are amongst those that I generally accept as elements of disruption that may well explain his early descent into entrenched substance abuse and related criminal lifestyles. So much is certainly consistent with the extent and duration of the offender’s criminal record, which I find, more probably than not, is explained in large measure by features of an unfortunate and early introduction to illicit substance abuse. I accept also that the offender has lived within an environment where criminality and exposure to risks has become part of his life from adolescence.

The fact that each of the offender’s brothers has found themselves in custody of one kind or another, and I note that I am told a third brother also finds himself in custody, is consistent with the formulation that I have arrived upon. Although I take into account evidence of disadvantage in his upbringing and that the offender has continued in involvement in illicit drugs, that is largely explanatory and as a matter of law does not mitigate his offending.”

“I have read the annexures summaries in Associate Professor Woods’ report relating to the assessments by Odyssey House in the period from 20 to 27 February 2009. They satisfy me that it is more probable than not that a substantial explanation for the offender’s involvement in a criminality activity has been his longstanding psychological weakness for illicit drugs and the related involvement to which this may well have drawn him”.


	
	The part of the judgment that is challenged on appeal is where his Honour said:
	


“I do, however, find that the offender came from a family background which on his account was dysfunctional during a sensitive time of his upbringing. Factors of that nature do not exhaust themselves, although the fact of the matter is their force in a mature man who has had ample opportunity to address his difficulties that may be diminished by reasons of that factor.”


	
	I accept the applicant’s submission that the suggestion by the sentencing Judge that this factor was “diminished” because he was “a mature man” who had “ample opportunity to address his difficulties” is contrary to the law as explained by the High Court in Bugmy v The Queen. [4] 
	
	
	Bugmy v The Queen concerned an Aboriginal offender from far western New South Wales who had been exposed to violence and alcoholism at a very young age. He was 29 at the time of the offences, had an extensive criminal history including a record for violence and had spent much of his adult life in gaol. The sentencing Judge gave significant weight to the offender’s dysfunctional upbringing. The prosecution appealed against the asserted inadequacy of the sentence. The prosecution submitted (in the Court of Criminal Appeal) that the dysfunctional childhood and associated problems “lost much of its weight when it was raised against a background of numerous previous offences”. [5]  The Court of Criminal Appeal accepted this submission. Hoeben JA (as his Honour then was) said: [6] 
	


“I agree that with the passage of time, the extent to which social deprivation in a person's youth and background can be taken into account, must diminish. This is particularly so when the passage of time has included substantial offending. Nevertheless, it is still a matter of relevance which can properly be taken into account in the sentencing process.”


	
	The Crown appeal was allowed (on other grounds) and Mr Bugmy was re-sentenced. He was granted leave to appeal to the High Court. In a joint judgment six of the seven judges concluded that the approach taken in the Court of Criminal Appeal was erroneous: [7] 
	


“25 In the Court of Criminal Appeal the prosecution argued that given the appellant's age and record of serious criminal offending, it had been an error for Judge Lerve to give weight to the propositions stated in Fernando. Hoeben JA said of this submission:

'I agree that with the passage of time, the extent to which social deprivation in a person's youth and background can be taken into account, must diminish. This is particularly so when the passage of time has included substantial offending.'

26 Nonetheless, Hoeben JA said that consideration of the appellant's background of social deprivation remained a matter of relevance which could properly be taken into account in sentencing. However, any reduction on this account would be ""modest"".

27 The appellant challenges Hoeben JA's statement of the principle. He submits that the effects of childhood deprivation do not diminish with time and with repeated incarceration. Despite his age and his long criminal record, he contends that it was open to Judge Lerve to impose a lenient sentence reflecting his reduced moral culpability for his offence.

…

42 It will be recalled that in the Court of Criminal Appeal the prosecution submitted that the evidence of the appellant's deprived background lost much of its force when viewed against the background of his previous offences. On the hearing of the appeal in this Court the Director did not maintain that submission. The Director acknowledges that the effects of profound deprivation do not diminish over time and he submits that they are to be given full weight in the determination of the appropriate sentence in every case.

43 The Director's submission should be accepted. The experience of growing up in an environment surrounded by alcohol abuse and violence may leave its mark on a person throughout life. Among other things, a background of that kind may compromise the person's capacity to mature and to learn from experience. It is a feature of the person's make-up and remains relevant to the determination of the appropriate sentence, notwithstanding that the person has a long history of offending.

44 Because the effects of profound childhood deprivation do not diminish with the passage of time and repeated offending, it is right to speak of giving ""full weight"" to an offender's deprived background in every sentencing decision. However, this is not to suggest, as the appellant's submissions were apt to do, that an offender's deprived background has the same (mitigatory) relevance for all of the purposes of punishment. Giving weight to the conflicting purposes of punishment is what makes the exercise of the discretion so difficult. An offender's childhood exposure to extreme violence and alcohol abuse may explain the offender's recourse to violence when frustrated such that the offender's moral culpability for the inability to control that impulse may be substantially reduced. However, the inability to control the violent response to frustration may increase the importance of protecting the community from the offender.”


	
	There is no relevant difference between the approach taken by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Bugmy and the approach taken by the sentencing Judge in the present case. In each instance, the court took into account the dysfunctional background but held that its impact on the sentencing exercise was “diminished” by the passage of time because (in Bugmy) there was a lengthy history of offending and (in this case) the applicant had “ample opportunity to address his difficulties.”
	
	
	The respondent attempted to distinguish this case from Bugmy on two bases. First, it was submitted that the Court of Criminal Appeal in Bugmy “effectively [reduced] it to the point that it had no weight whereas in [the present case] the sentencing Judge was in fact still giving it weight.” [8]  However, this submission cannot be accepted given that “Hoeben JA said that consideration of the appellant's background of social deprivation remained a matter of relevance which could properly be taken into account in sentencing”. [9] 
	
	
	The second basis upon which the respondent sought to distinguish Bugmy was that the present case involved “planning and organisation”. Reliance was placed on certain observations by this Court in Taysavang v R; Lee v R. [10]  However, it was not on this basis that the sentencing Judge in the present case “diminished” the significance of the applicant’s dysfunctional background. Rather, it was on the basis that he had “ample opportunity” to address his problems. Further, while the offence involved a degree of planning, there was little evidence of the extent of that planning. Finally, the offence was committed in the context of Mr Ohanian’s involvement in the drug culture, which was at the very heart of his dysfunctional upbringing. He was introduced to drugs at a tender age by his stepfather and was exposed to drug use and the criminal milieu surrounding drugs throughout his formative years.
	
	
	For these reasons, Ground 1 must be upheld and the Court must exercise the sentencing discretion afresh. If this Court concludes that a lesser sentence is warranted, the appeal must be allowed. [11] 
	


Ground 2: The sentence was manifestly excessive.


	
	In view of the fact that the Court must consider the appropriate sentence for itself, it may not strictly be necessary to determine this ground.
	
	
	The applicant relied on statistics maintained by the Judicial Commission and the outcome in a case called Perdija v R. [12]  The applicant submitted that upon synthesising all of the circumstances of the case, both objective and subjective, the Court would come to the instinctive or intuitive conclusion that the sentence was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	Counsel appearing for the respondent was critical of the approach adopted by the applicant. It was submitted that no range was established, particularly not by reference to one individual case and the statistics. The Crown pointed to well established authority concerning the flexibility allowed to sentencing judges in the exercise of the sentencing discretion and to the fact that, for this ground to succeed, it was necessary for the applicant to establish that the sentence was “unreasonable” or “plainly unjust”. It was submitted that Perdija was a completely different case and, while it involved a more serious charge, it was the fact that the applicant in that case was a first offender whereas Mr Ohanian had a significant criminal record, including prior drug offences, and was on parole at the time he committed the offence. Counsel also provided a helpful schedule of twenty previous cases in support of her submission that sentence imposed on the applicant was not manifestly excessive.
	
	
	The respondent’s submissions are correct. Taking into account the seriousness of the offending, the matters taken into account on the Form 1 which increase the need for specific deterrence and retribution, the breach of parole and the offender’s criminal history, the sentence imposed on the applicant was not manifestly excessive. It was not “plainly unjust” or “manifestly wrong”. [13] 
	


Re-sentencing


	
	Because error has been found (pursuant to ground 1), it is necessary to re-exercise the sentencing discretion to determine whether a different, less severe, sentence was warranted. [14] 
	
	
	I have taken into account the seriousness of the offence and the maximum penalty of 15 years. As the respondent submitted, deterrence and denunciation is an important purpose of punishment in cases of this kind. The quantity of drugs involved was substantial and many times more than the indictable quantity prescribed by the legislation. The breach of parole was a significant aggravating feature of the offence. The matters to be taken into account mean that personal deterrence and retribution must play a more significant role in the sentencing exercise.
	
	
	On the other hand, the applicant’s dysfunctional upbringing and his early and ongoing exposure to drug use and the drug underworld provides a compelling explanation for his addiction and ongoing involvement in criminal offences such as the one for which he is to be sentenced. They have resulted in significant and chronic mental health problems. As the sentencing Judge found, his time in custody is likely to be more onerous as a result. The applicant has made sporadic, and at times quite successful, attempts at rehabilitation. The fact that he has a loving and supportive wife, and four children under the age of ten years, provides him with a compelling motive to rehabilitate himself. One of the important purposes of punishment in these circumstances is to foster his rehabilitation.
	
	
	Notwithstanding these matters, there is no doubt that there is no alternative to imposing a custodial sentence of some length. Because of the length of that sentence, there is no alternative to it being served in custody.
	
	
	Taking into account all of these factors, which pull in opposite directions, I would commence with a starting point of five years. I would reduce the sentence by 25% (1 year and 3 months) for the plea of guilty, resulting in a total sentence of 3 years and 9 months. I would find special circumstances in the accumulation on the pre-existing parole period, the fact that the offender will find the custodial part of his sentence more onerous as a result of his mental health issues and the desirability of an extended period of supervised parole. In view of his recent history, the applicant is well aware of the consequences of any breach of this parole. I would set a non-parole period of 2 years.
	
	
	Because the sentence that I would impose is less than that imposed by the sentencing Judge, the application for leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal upheld.
	


Orders


	
	For those reasons, the orders I favour are as follows:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal upheld.
	
	
	Sentence imposed on 24 March 2017 quashed.
	
	
	In lieu thereof, the applicant is sentenced to a non-parole period of two years commencing 10 January 2016 and expiring 9 January 2018 with a balance of term of one year and nine months commencing 10 January 2018 and expiring on 9 October 2019.
	
	
	The applicant will be eligible for release on parole at the conclusion of the non-parole period.

6522868,Filip Black v Regina [2017] NSWDC 326,"Judgment


	
	Filip Black (the appellant) appeals against the conviction entered by her Honour Magistrate Stapleton on 1 May 2017 at the Downing Centre Local Court.
	
	
	The appellant pleaded not guilty to one count of use offensive language in a public place contrary to section 4A Summary Offences Act 1988.
	
	
	At about 9.15am on 14 July 2016 the appellant was walking on Robertson Road at Centennial Park. He was wearing a black hoodie and carrying a backpack. A police patrol stopped to speak to him. The exchange that followed was recorded by a video camera attached to the shoulder strap of his backpack, providing a complete audio and partial video record of the conversation.
	
	
	The appellant objected to being spoken to by the police and was uncooperative with them. When asked by Constable Ritchie what he was doing, he responded, “None of your fucking business”. Constable Ritchie informed the appellant that he was under arrest for offensive language. A short time later in the conversation Constable Ritchie said the appellant “you’re fucking worked up”. The appellant pointed out that it was arrested for offensive language but it was apparently alright for the police officer to use that language. After this point the police officer agreed to let the original use of offensive language “slide” but he told the appellant that he was not free to leave and was to be searched. The reasonable suspicion relied on by the police officer was that the area was renowned for break-ins and that the appellant had given him ‘attitude’.
	
	
	The police officer then asked the appellant for identification. The appellant refused. The police officer then cited this refusal as a factor going to his reasonable suspicion for conducting the search, and then accepted that the appellant was not legally required to provide his details. The police officer said that he would not have searched the appellant if he had provided his details.
	
	
	During and after the search the police officer continued to ask the appellant for identification. The search was conducted on the street and the police officer threatened to put the appellant on the ground in handcuffs if he looked at him during the search.
	
	
	At the completion of the search the appellant was told to leave. The appellant then said, “Hope you go get done like those assholes in Dallas”. The appellant is then alleged to have said, “Fuck it right in your Mum’s pussy”. This last statement was not recorded on the video recording.
	
	
	The Magistrate found that the last statement was offensive language and convicted the appellant.
	


The relevant law


	
	The applicable principles to be applied in determination of the appeal are as follows.
	
	
	Section 18(1) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 provides that the appeal is a rehearing on the certified transcripts of evidence, obviously as supplemented by reference to the exhibits tendered in the Local Court and is not an appeal de novo: Gianoutsas v Glykis [2006] NSWCCA 137 at [24]-[31];
	
	
	The principles governing appeals from judges sitting without a jury apply in that the appellate judge is to form his or her own judgement of the facts while recognising the advantage enjoyed by the magistrate who saw and heard the witnesses called and observing the natural limitations stemming from proceeding wholly or substantially on the transcript record: Charara v R [2006] NSWCCA 244 at [17]-[22].
	
	
	Whilst the magistrate’s reasons are not part of the certified transcripts referred to in section 18(1), recourse may be had to them since the appellate function could not properly take place without reference to them: Charara [23]-[24].
	
	
	The Court is obliged to give the judgement which in its opinion ought to have been given in the first instance: Fox v Percy (2003) 214 CLR 118 at [23].
	
	
	The powers of the District Court are exercisable where the appellant demonstrates that the order the subject of the appeal is the result of a legal, factual or discretionary error in which event the appellate court can substitute its own decision based on the facts and law as they then stand: Dyason v Butterworth [2015] NSWCA 52 at [28].
	
	
	The issue of whether or not error is strictly required before the District Court can intervene was considered but not decided in AG v Director of Public Prosecutions [2015] NSWCA 218. I have proceeded on the basis that I am bound by the law as it is stated in Dyason and other subsequent decisions including Bandana v Director of Public Prosecutions [2016] NSWCA 140 at [10] and Englebrecht v Director of Public Prosecutions [2016] NSWCA 290 at [91]..
	
	
	The term “error” has no precise meaning. It refers broadly to the satisfaction of the appellate judge that the trial judge was wrong and should be corrected. Put negatively, it means that the judgment of the trial judge will not be set aside unless the appellate judge is satisfied that the judgment is wrong. How that state of satisfaction is achieved will depend on a range of factors. A miscarriage of justice warranting intervention may occur in the absence of “error” in the ordinary meaning of that term: AG at [34] per Basten JA.
	
	
	Section 4A Summary Offences Act 1988 relevantly provides
	


A person must not use offensive language in or near, or within hearing from, a public place or a school.

Maximum penalty: 6 penalty units.

It is a sufficient defence to a prosecution for an offence under this section if the defendant satisfies the court that the defendant had a reasonable excuse for conducting himself or herself in the manner alleged in the information for the offence.


	
	The use of an offensive word will not be prima facie offensive. Whether or not the language is offensive will depend on the application of an evaluatory standard after due consideration of the circumstances and the context: Dalton v Bartlett (1972) 3 SASR 549 at 555, cited in Dowse v New South Wales [2012] NSWCA 337 at [24] per Basten JA (McColl and Hoeben JJA agreeing).
	
	
	In Coleman v Power (2004) 220 CLR 1, Gleeson CJ at [14]-[15] said that a Queensland statute prohibiting the use of “threatening, abusive or insulting words” in a public place required more than the language being “merely derogatory” of the person to whom it was addressed. The language needed to be of such a nature that the use of it in a public place was contrary to the contemporary standards of public good order and goes beyond an exercise of freedom to express an opinion on controversial issues.
	
	
	The reasonable excuse defence involves an evaluative judgement. The term “reasonable excuse” has been used in many statutes. What is a reasonable excuse depends upon the circumstances of the case and the purpose of the provision to which the defence of reasonable excuse is an exception: Taikato v The Queen (1996) 186 CLR 454 at 464 per Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ. A reasonable excuse is no more or less than an excuse that would be accepted by a reasonable person: Taikato at 470.
	
	
	The onus of proving a reasonable excuse is on the appellant on the balance of probabilities.
	
	
	When a power of search is given by statute that exercise of the power must be exercised strictly in compliance with the statutory power and with the clearest of authority: Henderson v O’Connell [1937] VLR 171 at 176 and applied by the Full Federal Court in Noordof v Bartlett (1986) 12 FCR 209 and cited with approval by McHugh J in Coleman v Power (2004) 220 CLR 1 at [118]-[120]. The police do not have a common law right to commit a trespass by continuing their investigations when their statutory power that authorises the commission of a trespass comes to an end: Kuru v State of New South Wales (2008) 236 CLR 1.
	
	
	Section 21 Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 (LEPRA) relevantly provides that a police officer may without warrant stop search and detain a person, and anything in the possession of or under complete control of the person if the police officer suspects on reasonable grounds that the person has in his or her possession anything stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained.
	
	
	Section 30 LEPRA provides that a police officer who is authorised to search a person may carry out a frisk search or an ordinary search.
	
	
	Section 32 LEPRA relevantly requires a police officer conducting a search so far as is reasonably practicable to, inform the person if they will be required to remove clothing during search and why is necessary to do so, ask for the person’s cooperation, conduct the search in a way at provides reasonable privacy and is as quick as possible, conduct the least invasive kind of search practicable and must not search the genital area of the person unless it is necessary to do so for the purposes of the search.
	
	
	A reasonable suspicion involves less than a reasonable belief but more than a possibility. There must be something that would create in the mind of a reasonable person an apprehension of the intended state of affairs. A reason to suspect that a fact exists is more than a reason to consider or look into the possibility of its existence. Some factual basis for the suspicion must be demonstrated and that basis must have some probative value. What is important is the information in the mind of the police officer at the relevant time. Regard must be had for the source of the information and its content: R v Rondo [2001] NSWCCA 540 at [53].
	
	
	No adverse inference can be drawn from a person insisting on their rights being adhered to and the law strictly followed, and such conduct should not be confused with conduct that can be considered suspicious: Straet v Bauer NSWSC unreported 16 March 1998, per Smart J.
	


Analysis of the magistrate’s reasons


	
	Much of the Local Court proceedings concerned if the evidence of the offensive language should be excluded because it was unlawfully obtained because the search of the appellant was unlawful. The Magistrate decided that the detention was over when the last statement was uttered and therefore should not be excluded. For the reasons that follow, I am of the view that the initial arrest and the following search was unlawful.
	
	
	In deciding the case, the Magistrate decided that the last statement was spoken by the appellant and that it was offensive. On appeal, the appellant did not argue that the words were not said by him on the basis that this was not put to the police officer in the Local Court. I note that everything else that was said at the time was clearly recorded. There are good objective grounds for having a reasonable doubt that the words were spoken, however this was not in issue for the reasons I have stated.
	
	
	The Magistrate did not consider the statutory defence of reasonable excuse.
	


Consideration


	
	In my view, the magistrate made a number of legal and factual errors in determining that the search was lawful and for the reasons that follow I have come to the conclusion that it was unlawful.
	
	
	First, the initial arrest for offensive language was unlawful. The police officer did not turn his mind to whether there was an alternate way that the matter could be dealt with. The police officer conceded that he was wrong and discontinued the arrest, which he was entitled to do.
	
	
	Second, the only proper basis for holding a suspicion was that the area was allegedly renowned for break-ins. No evidence was produced to support that allegation, for example in the form of intelligence reports or hearsay directions by the police officer’s superiors to patrol that area for that purpose. The other bases were that the appellant had insisted on his legal rights not to identify himself and not to assist the police. Those matters could not be a proper basis for the suspicion. All that was left was that the appellant was walking along a street at about 9am in the morning, wearing a black hoodie, with the hood up, on a cold day.
	
	
	I agree with the Magistrate that the appellant was not being detained at the time that the words were spoken and the evidence was not unlawfully or illegally obtained. 
	
	
	The appellant was detained for about 10-15 minutes for the search. He was repeatedly asked for identification, even after the police officer conceded that he had no right to ask for it. Considering all the circumstances, the police officer was determined to get the appellant’s identity information from him and to challenge his right to be walking on a public street, whether his powers allowed him to do so or not. Notwithstanding that the appellant’s behaviour was impolite and progressing to obnoxious, the police officer’s powers were limited. The police officer sought to achieve a result with little regard to the appellant’s rights. It was the protracted and unjustified interference with the appellant’s civil liberties that ultimately culminated in the offence being committed.
	
	
	The appellant was entitled to be upset by the interference with his rights. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that he had a reasonable excuse for his offensive language.
	


Conclusion


	
	The orders I make are as follows:
	



	
	Appeal against conviction is allowed.
	
	
	I set aside the conviction and the penalty imposed by the magistrate.

6523566,Sentencing remarks of Mr Justice Gilbart: R v Endris Mohammed,"BIRMINGHAM CROWN COURT 

  

R 

v 

ENDRIS MOHAMMED 

 

 

SENTENCING REMARKS OF MR JUSTICE GILBART 

 

1.  You  stand  to  be  sentenced  by  the  Court  for  the  murders  in  the  early  hours  of  28th 

October 2016 of your two children Saros and Leanor, then aged 8 and 6 years,  and the 

attempted murder of your partner and their mother Penil Teklehaimanot.  

2.  This country has a long proud history of welcoming those from abroad who flee from 

persecution. Both of you had done so, and established your lives here in Birmingham, 

along with  your two children. However that secure and apparently happy family life 

was destroyed by you. As I have said,  your partner had established her life here as a 

refugee from persecution. That safe haven she shared with  you and her children was 

destroyed  by  you  in  the  most  appalling  manner  imaginable,  for  this  was  a  terrible 

criminal enterprise on your part, designed to kill all three of your family, partner and 

children, as they slept. Your partner has now lost her whole family and her home at one 

fell swoop. She gave evidence and has conducted herself in this trial with dignity and 

restraint, and in her evidence she was generous enough to speak of your good qualities 

as a father and partner. Her victim impact statement speaks of the fine qualities of these 

two happy, cheerful,  engaging and rewarding children of whom any parent could be
--------
justly  proud.  Instead  of  their  growing  into  adulthood,  and  their  talents  and  qualities 

being allowed to  flourish,  you have deliberately  snuffed out  their  young lives. Their 

mother escaped death, but she must endure that tragic loss as she rebuilds her life. 

3.  What makes that all the more poignant is that they loved you, as did your partner. Your 

children looked to you for guidance, protection and love. They trusted you implicitly 

and were enjoying your company even on the night of their murder. You repaid their 

trust in you by killing them. 

4.  So far as the two murders are concerned, I am required to pass life sentences, and to 

determine the minimum term which you must serve before being considered for release. 

So far as the attempted murder is concerned, I shall also take the circumstances of that 

into account when considering the length of that minimum term.  

5.  In the early hours of 28th October 2016, you scattered petrol around the living room of 

the house the four of you shared, having tried to disconnect the cooker and gas hose, 

ready  to  set  light  to  the house  where  your  partner  slept  upstairs.  Your  idea  was  that 

when the petrol caught light, there would be a conflagration which would consume all 

three of them. You even turned off the power- no doubt in the belief that it would stop 

the smoke alarms from working. You smothered your children with petrol soaked cloth 

before or after preparing the other parts of the conflagration. You told the psychiatrists 

that you did so to prevent them feeling the ghastly death of being burned alive. I give 

that little credence, as you were prepared to see your partner thus consumed, and took 

steps by trying to disconnect the gas hose to make the fire greater, and by disconnecting 

the mains supply to reduce her chances of escape.  

6.  That the conflagration did not take place was because you did not understand that you 

had made the atmosphere too full of petrol fumes, and because the gas hose had been 

designed to resist being cut. The smoke alarm woke your partner.  Fortunately, she was 

able to escape with the help of her neighbours, the Hughes family. But it was too late 

for the children, both of whom you had smothered. 

7.  I am also quite unable to accept that you had planned your own suicide, and that this 

was part and parcel of it. If that were the case you would not have withdrawn any money 

from a bank at some time after 9.00 pm that evening. You did not try to set light to the 

house with yourself in it, nor douse yourself in petrol. The scientific evidence revealed 

none on your car. What I am quite sure of is that you set light to the house as you left, 

leaving your sleeping wife and smothered children within, and intending that the fire 

you set would consume them all. But as you knew, that fire did not light. You drove
--------
off, knowing that what you had done would be easily discovered once your partner got 

downstairs. 

8.  Then, knowing full well that the house had not gone up in a conflagration, you drove 

to Newcastle under Lyme, where you inflicted terrible burns on yourself by setting light 

to leaves in your car. Why you did so is not clear to me.  

9.  I turn now to Schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, to which I must have regard 

in fixing the minimum term you will serve. In my judgement, paragraph 5(1)(a) and (2) 

apply, because two victims were murdered, and you tried to kill a third. 

10. It follows that the starting point is one of 30 years, as this matter involves two murders. 

I must then look to see if there are aggravating factors which push the figure up, and 

ant  mitigating  factors  which  bring  it  down.  I  find  the  following  aggravating  factors 

under paragraph 10 of the Schedule; 

a.  there was some planning involved. You had gone out to buy the petrol you used 

that afternoon, and the steps you took to achieve a conflagration were planned; 

b.  you tried to kill their mother as well; 

c.  both of your child victims were vulnerable because of their age; 

d.  you were in a position of trust with regard to them, which you abused; 

e.  you tried to  achieve destruction of  your three intended victims by setting  the 

house on fire. 

11. As  to  mitigating  factors  under  paragraph  11,  I  am  prepared  to  accept  that  you  had 

feelings  of  despair  and  some  recurrence  of  your  previously  occurring  depressive 

disorder,  but  it  fell  well  short  of  establishing  diminished  responsibility.  There  is  no 

evidence of any other psychiatric condition. I find no other mitigating factor. Your own 

terrible injuries were entirely self-inflicted. 

12. I record also that you denied all three counts, and did not give evidence from the witness 

box. While you have accepted responsibility for killing your children, albeit after the 

prosecution had got under way,  you did not do so for attempting to kill  your wife. I 

shall give some modest discount on that account. 

13. I take into account your previous good character. In the circumstances of this case, that 

carries little weight. 

14. Bearing all those matters in mind, the aggravating factors would increase the sentence 

to  36  years.  The  effect  of  your  depressive  illness,  such  is  at  was,  and  some  modest 

allowance your acceptance of responsibility for the killings, allows me to reduce that 

minimum term to a period of 33 years.
--------
15. So far as Count  3 is concerned, it is  difficult  to apply the definitive guideline of the 

Sentencing  Council  because  I  am  not  sentencing  you  in  isolation.  I  shall  pass  a 

concurrent determinate sentence. 

16. The sentences I pass upon you are: 

a.  on  Count  3  there  will  be  a  concurrent  determinate  sentence  of  10  years 

imprisonment to the sentences on Counts 1 and 2 which I am about to pass; 

b.  on Counts 1 and 2 there will be concurrent life sentences with a minimum term 

of 33 years, less time spent in custody of 306 days, making 32 years 59 days.   

You will not be considered for release by the Parole Board until you have served 

at least that minimum term.",2017-11-20 00:00:00,UK Crown Court

 Kan Ting Chiu SJ:
1       These grounds of decision are supplemental to the first grounds of decision that I issued on 11 May 2017 (see 
Public Prosecutor v Muhammad Nur Sallehin bin Kamaruzaman
 
[2017] SGHC 107
). At that time the Accused, Muhammad Nur Sallehin bin Kamaruzaman, had only appealed against the sentence of life imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane imposed on him. He subsequently amended his appeal to appeal extended to his conviction as well, and these supplemental grounds will deal with the conviction.
2       The Accused was convicted on a charge that he:
on 7 February 2012 at about 5.29pm, at the Woodlands Checkpoint, Singapore, together with one Nur Dianey Mohamed Salim (NRIC No. S XXXXXXXX) and in furtherance of the common intention of [them] both, did import a Class ‘A’ controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Misuse of Drugs Act”), to wit, three packets containing 493.5 grams of crystalline substance which were analysed and found to contain 
not less than 378.92 grams of methamphetamine
, without any authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and [he had] thereby committed an offence under section 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act read with section 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Penal Code”) and punishable under section 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, and further, upon [his] conviction under section 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act read with section 34 of the Penal Code, [he might] alternatively be liable to be punished under section 33B of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
[emphasis in original]
3       He was also charged with three other charges, including a charge for importing 100 pink tablets containing ecstasy recovered from one of the bundles,
[note: 1]
 but this charge was stood down.
The arrest 
4       On 7 February 2012 at about 5.30pm, the Accused was stopped at the Woodlands Checkpoint (“the Checkpoint”). The Accused was with his mother, Normalah binti Mohamed Said (“Normalah”), and Nur Dianey Mohamed Salim (“Dianey”). They were entering Singapore in Normalah’s car SJK 2013Z,
[note: 2]
 which Normalah was driving.
5       The car was searched by officers of the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) at the Checkpoint. The officers found a Daia brand washing powder box
[note: 3]
 in the boot of the car.
[note: 4]
 When the base of the box was opened, three bundles
[note: 5]
 wrapped in cling wrap were found. When the cling wrap was removed from the bundles, each bundle was found to contain a packet of white crystalline substance; and the third bundle was also found to contain two smaller packets of pink tablets.
[note: 6]
 (To be clear, I use the word “bundle” to describe the items when wrapped in cling wrap, and the word “packet” to describe the items after the cling wrap was removed).
6       The white crystalline substance and the pink tablets were sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis. The outcome of the analysis was that the three bundles of white crystalline substance were methamphetamine, which became the subject-matter of the charge for importing methamphetamine.
7       Methamphetamine is also known as ice, and the drug in the pink tablets, which has a complex pharmacological name, is commonly known as ecstasy. There was no issue over the identification and quantification of the drugs in the packets.
Actions taken after the arrest
8       As stated earlier, the Accused was charged with four charges. The prosecution proceeded on charge set out in [2] above.
9       Dianey was also charged with importing methamphetamine with the Accused. In her case, the charge stated the weight of the methamphetamine as not less than 249.99 grams (below the 250 gram threshold that would attract capital punishment), although the statement of facts stated the actual weight of the methamphetamine as not less than 378.92 grams. She pleaded guilty to the charge and was sentenced to twenty years imprisonment.
[note: 7]
10     In the course of this trial, much time was spent over whether Dianey was married to the Accused and the effect that would have on the case against the Accused. This was ultimately a red herring, as I shall explain at the end of these grounds of decision.
11     No action was taken against Normalah.
The Accused’s statements
12     Subsequent to the discovery of the bundles in the Daia box, the Accused was placed under arrest, and a series of statements were recorded from him. All these statements were admitted in evidence during the trial. No issue was raised regarding voluntariness, although the Accused raised issues regarding the veracity of the contents of some of the statements.
The contemporaneous statement
13     The first statement was a contemporaneous statement
[note: 8]
 recorded by Sgt Ibrahim bin Juasa (“Sgt Ibrahim”) at 7.35pm on 7 February 2012 at the CNB office at the Checkpoint. The statement was typewritten, and was signed by the Accused. It read as follows:

The statement indicated that it was recorded from “1735 hrs” on 7 February 2012. However, Sgt Ibrahim corrected the commencement time from “1735 hrs” to “1935 hrs” when he gave evidence.
14     On 8 February 2012, before the HSA analysis was completed, the Accused was charged with that he:
on the 7
th
 day of February 2012 at or about 5.29 p.m., at the Woodlands Checkpoint, Singapore, did import a controlled drug specified in Class ‘A’ of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drug Act, Chapter 185, to wit, 
three (3) packets
 of white crystalline substance weighing approximately 553.04 grams believed to contain Methamphetamine, at the said place, without authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder and [he had] thereby committed an offence under Section 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185 and punishable under Section 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185.
[emphasis added]
A cautioned statement
[note: 9]
 in answer to the charge was recorded from the Accused under s 23 of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (Act 15 of 2010). In this statement, the Accused said:
I was promised by him that he would not give me more than 
100 grams of Ice. He was the one who packed
. So, if I want to check, I have to re-open the box again. I do not know how to re-seal it back properly. I do not have a weighing machine with me that can measure this big amount of Ice.
[emphasis added]
(The Accused clarified in his evidence in court that the unnamed person he referred to in the statement was Pai Kia).
The investigation statements
15     In the course of investigations, the investigation officer Insp Chua Zhi Wei (“Insp Chua”) recorded five statements
[note: 10]
 from the Accused between 10 February 2012 and 19 April 2012 covering the events of the day of his arrest and his dealings with Pai Kia (“the Pai Kia statements”).
16     In these statements, the Accused narrated that:
(a)     He had known a person by the name of Pai Kia for about a year. Pai Kia offered him $800 to bring tawas (a substance consumed to “wash urine”) into Singapore, to test if tawas could be detected by the scanner at Singapore checkpoints.
(b)     On 6 February 2012, when he was in Johor, he met Pai Kia and agreed to help him bring tawas to Singapore.
(c)     On 7 February 2012, he went with Dianey to Carrefour [a supermarket] in Johor and they bought a box of washing powder.
(d)     After buying the box of washing powder, he drove his aunt’s car to meet Pai Kia. He left the box with Pai Kia for about half an hour and collected it back from him thereafter. He asked Pai Kia what was in the box. Pai Kia told him: “Not to worry. As I promise you before, I just want to try this”. He did not open the box to check its contents.
(e)     After collecting the box from Pai Kia, he returned to his grandmother’s house and transferred the box to the boot of his mother’s car.
(f)     He left with his mother and Dianey in his mother’s car for Singapore at about 5.00pm.
(g)     At the Checkpoint, the CNB officers searched the car and found the box of washing powder and recovered the three bundles inside the box.
[note: 11]
(h)     If he had known that he would be bringing ice into Singapore, he would have rejected Pai Kia’s offer of $800.
[note: 12]
(i)     He had no idea what illegal items the box contained.
[note: 13]
(j)     He had “mixed feelings” that the box contained tawas.
[note: 14]
17     The Accused’s narration of the events changed radically in his investigation statement made subsequently on 15 January 2013.
[note: 15]
 This took place when Insp Chua (who had been promoted to the rank of Assistant Superintendent) visited him at Changi Prison, where he was remanded, and informed him that DNA found on the cling wrap from the bundles matched his DNA and Dianey’s DNA.
18     In this statement (“the Bob statement”) the Accused abandoned his original account, in which he referred to Pai Kia and tawas, and referred to a different person called Bob, and different substances, 
ie
, ice and ecstasy. He stated that:
(a)     On 6 February 2012, he and Dianey were at the home of his friend Bob. Bob asked him to bring some ice into Singapore, and he agreed to do that. Bob offered him some money for his help, and told him that the weight of the ice was 250 grams.
(b)     On 7 February 2012, at about 6.00am, he and Dianey collected ice and ecstasy from Bob.
(c)     He and Dianey brought the ice and ecstasy to their room [in his grandmother’s home in Johor Bahru] and kept them there.
(d)     At about 11.00am, he and Dianey drove to Carrefour, bought a box of washing powder, and brought it back to their room.
(e)     Dianey cut the box and asked him to look for something to wrap the ice and ecstasy with. He found and handed to her some wrapping material described as “string wrap”.
[note: 16]
 (The Accused was probably referring to the cling wrap in which the bundles were wrapped.)
(f)     After handing the wrapping material to Dianey, he had a shower. After the shower, he noticed that the drugs were already packed into the box. He used glue to seal the box and brought it to the boot of his mother’s car.
(g)     He had lied in his previous statements because he was afraid, but now he was willing to tell the truth.
Close of the prosecution case
19     The Accused had made two sets of admissions in the Pai Kia statement and the Bob statements. Taking all the statements together with the changes in them, he had admitted that:
(a)     he had been in possession of the Daia washing powder box;
(b)     he knew that methamphetamine and ecstasy were hidden in the box;
(c)     he agreed to bring the methamphetamine and ecstasy to Singapore; and
(d)     he was doing that with Dianey when they were arrested.
20     The admissions and the circumstances of his arrest also triggered the presumptions in s 18(1) and (2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the MDA”) that he was in possession of the methamphetamine and was aware of its nature.
21     The admissions and the presumptions established a sufficient case for the Accused to be called upon to enter his defence.
The Accused’s defence
22     The Accused’s defence was unexpectedly brief. When he stated his defence in his evidence-in-chief, his counsel did not bring him through the statements he made during the investigation.
23     The Accused’s defence was that on the morning of the day of his arrest, he and Dianey went to Bob’s house in his aunt’s car. At Bob’s house, he, Dianey, Bob and Bob’s wife consumed ice, and Bob handed to him a bundle of white crystalline substance and pink tablets
[note: 17]
 which he handed to Dianey to keep in her bag.
24     He and Dianey left Bob’s house at about 8.00am. They went to his grandmother’s house and put the items there. They then went to Carrefour to buy the Daia box of washing powder and brought it back to their room in his grandmother’s house.
25     When they were in the room, Dianey suggested that they find something to wrap the ice and ecstasy. He found some cling wrap and brought it to the room, where he saw Dianey cutting the base of the box. He left the cling wrap there and went to the toilet for about an hour to consume ice and sniff glue.
26     When he came out of the toilet, Dianey told him she had packed the drugs into the box. He then sealed the box, which was subsequently brought to and kept in the boot of his mother’s car.
27     When they returned to Singapore in the car, the car was checked by officers of the CNB who discovered the box in the boot. They asked who the box belonged to. He saw one bundle,
[note: 18]
 and admitted that it was his. At that time he did not see the other two bundles.
[note: 19]
28     The prosecutor went through the defence with him in greater detail. The Accused was asked if the three bundles were shown to him when he made his contemporaneous statement.
[note: 20]
 His answer was that he could not remember that because he was high on drugs.
[note: 21]
 (It was not put to Sgt Ibrahim who testified positively that he pointed the three packets to the Accused,
[note: 22]
 that the three packets were not shown to him). A reading of the contemporaneous statement (see [13] above) shows that the Accused was alert and clear-thinking when he gave his answers.
29     The Accused also claimed that he could not remember saying that the ice and pink tablets belonged to Pai Kia,
[note: 23]
 and that he did not have a friend called Pai Kia with the telephone number given in his contemporaneous statement.
[note: 24]
 He went on to say that he might have lied when he made the statement because he was afraid.
[note: 25]
 He explained that a CNB officer who conducted the search on the car told him that if he did not admit knowledge of the drugs, they would implicate everybody; and he did not want his mother to get involved.
[note: 26]
 (It was not put to Sgt Ibrahim or Corporal Vengedesh Raj Nainar, the CNB officers involved in the search, or any other CNB officer that this threat was made).
30     The prosecutor also cross-examined the Accused on his cautioned statement,
[note: 27]
 where he said that Pai Kia had promised him that there was no more than 100 grams of ice involved. The Accused clarified that Pai Kia had told him that the weight was 125 grams and he did not know why he had mentioned 100 grams in the statement.
[note: 28]
 (This answer to the prosecutor was meaningless because he had at the time of the cross-examination abandoned his account relating to Pai Kia and replaced it with the Bob narrative.)
31     The Accused was then referred to his investigation statements.
[note: 29]
 He agreed that he was no longer high on drugs when he made them. He was feeling better, but was experiencing withdrawal symptoms, and was delusional and was hearing voices.
[note: 30]
 (This was not supported by medical or expert evidence).
32     With regard to the Bob statement of 15 January 2013 (see [18] above),
[note: 31]
 where the Accused retracted the references to Pai Kia and tawas, his counsel confirmed to the court that the entire Pai Kia story was a fabrication.
[note: 32]
 The Accused confirmed that most of the Bob statement was the truth, although he did not know the weight of the drugs when he made this statement,
[note: 33]
 and he admitted that he lied in the Pai Kia statements.
[note: 34]
33     The Accused still had issues with the Bob statement. He did not say that Bob told him that there was 250 grams of ice (as recorded in paragraph 50). In fact Bob had told him that there were 125 grams of ice,
[note: 35]
 but the investigation officer (Insp Chua) told him his DNA was “found at the 250 grams”.
[note: 36]
 (That was not put to Insp Chua, and the implication that a DNA test can determine the weight of ice is simply preposterous; it was incredible for Insp Chua to have said that and for the Accused to have believed it.)
34     Moreover, he had made clear that Bob told him about the 250 grams when he stated in his last investigation statement of 21 June 2013:
[note: 37]
I wish to clarify that I did not ask my girlfriend Nur Dianey Mohamed Salim to pack the drugs. 
Bob told me that the ice was below 250 grams
, so I just took it. I also do not have weighing machine to check the weight.
[emphasis added]
35     While he admitted that he had lied about the existence and role of Pai Kia, the Accused’s position was that his account of Bob was true, and that Dianey also knew Bob
[note: 38]
 (although Dianey’s evidence was that she did not know anyone by that name.
[note: 39]
)
36     The Accused also expanded on his dealings with the box and the drugs. He and Dianey had discussed hiding the drugs in a box before they purchased the Daia box.
[note: 40]
37     There was some inconsistency in the number of packets of ice involved. In the Bob statement of 15 January 2013,
[note: 41]
 he stated that Bob handed to him one packet of white crystalline substance and two packets of pink tablets.
[note: 42]
 Dianey’s evidence, however, was that she packed two packets of ecstasy and two packets of ice.
[note: 43]
Evaluation of the defence
38     The Accused was in possession of the Daia washing powder box from which the ice and ecstasy were recovered. He admitted that he had intended to conceal the ice and ecstasy he received from Bob in the box, and to bring it to Singapore.
39     By these admissions, the Accused was importing methamphetamine into Singapore when he was arrested. The prosecution also submitted that the Accused was presumed under s 18(1) and (2) of the MDA to have possession of the methamphetamine and knowledge of its nature. As there was direct evidence on these matters, the case against the Accused was not dependant on the presumptions.
40     There were several issues raised in his defence. The first was whether he knew that the three bundles of ice were in the box.
41     Looking at the evidence as a whole, he had agreed with Bob to take ice and ecstasy to Singapore. He purchased the box of washing powder and arranged with Dianey to have the drugs wrapped in cling wrap and placed in the box. Although he said there was one packet, and Dianey remembered two packets, there were three packets recovered which were wrapped in the same way in cling wrap in the box. He had not expressed any disagreement with the references to three packets referred to in Question 1 in the contemporaneous statement (see [13] above) and in the charge
[note: 44]
 that he responded to his cautioned statement (see [14] above). The Accused and Dianey were the only persons engaged in wrapping the drugs and placing them in the box. They must have wrapped and packed the packets which were recovered. On the evidence he knew that the three packets were in the box.
42     The second issue was the quantity of drugs the Accused had agreed to carry into Singapore.
43     The Accused’s position on this issue was most unsatisfactory. In his cautioned statement,
[note: 45]
 he stated that he had been promised that it would be not more than 100 grams. In the Bob statement,
[note: 46]
 he said Bob told him that the ice weighed 250 grams, but he claimed in his evidence in court that it should be 125 grams but he said 250 grams because of the DNA test result (see [33] above). To compound the confusion, he said in his investigation statement of 21 June 2013 that Bob told him it was below 250 grams (see [34] above).
44     The only unequivocal part of the defence was that he agreed to carry ice for Bob. From his own evidence, Bob was not a reliable person as he had stated the weight of the ice to be 125 grams and 250 grams. It is noteworthy that mistake and reliance on Bob’s representations were not parts of his defence.
45     The Accused’s defence was set out in its closing submissions where it was stated:
[note: 47]
The Court will note (and this is to be said at the outset) that the Accused admits to importing (and intending to import) the meth contained in the exhibit A1A4A. Therefore, the evidence as to how the meth (and what quantity) was procured and in what fashion becomes critical for the Court’s consideration on the issue of what quantum of meth that was imported is to be ascribed to the Accused.
46     The basis for the submission was that the weight of the methamphetamine in packet A1A4A 
[note: 48]
 that the Accused admitted to was 92.49 grams.
47     However, the Accused’s evidence on the number of packets and the quantity of methamphetamine he agreed to carry cannot be accepted. On the evidence, I find that he had agreed to carry methamphetamine to Singapore, and that he and Dianey hid the three packets of drugs in the washing powder box. I also find that he was not told of the weight of the ice; and if he was told, he did not rely on it when he committed the offence.
48     In the circumstances, I find the Accused guilty on the charge he faced and convicted him.
Dianey’s alleged marriage to the Accused
49     In the course of the trial, it was contended by the defence that Dianey was married to the Accused at the time of the offence and consequently s 124 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the Evidence Act”) came into play. Section 124 states:
No person who is or has been married shall be compelled to disclose any 
communication made to him
 during marriage by any person to whom he is or has been married; nor shall he permitted to disclose any 
such communication
 unless the person who made it or his representative in interest consents, except in suits between married persons or proceedings in which one married person is prosecuted for any crime committed against the other.
[emphasis added]
According to defence counsel, s 124 restricted the evidence that could be led from Dianey.
50     The issue took up a considerable amount of time, but was ultimately irrelevant and without factual basis. Section 124 applies to 
communications
 made to a person by his or her spouse. Dianey’s evidence touched on her 
activities
 with the Accused during the disputed marriage, and did not go into what he told her. She recounted that they bought the Daia box to hide the drugs in, and that he found the cling wrap that she used to wrap the packets. As this evidence did not pertain to spousal communications, the marriage issue had no legal relevance.
51     More fundamentally, the defence did not prove that there was a marriage. From the time of their arrest and throughout the investigations, the Accused referred to Dianey as his girlfriend, and Dianey referred to him as her boyfriend.
52     The marriage issue came up in a most unusual way. It came out for first time during the cross-examination of the Accused’s mother, Normalah, when she tendered a document that purported to be a certified marriage certificate.
[note: 49]
 Normalah’s evidence was that she received it in the post. She remembered that it was posted from Johor Bahru, but could not remember when she received it and whether the document came with an accompanying note; and she did not know if the sender’s identity was disclosed on the envelope which she had thrown away. Essentially, she did not know why the unknown sender had sent the certificate to her without her request. Although the certificate was in Jawi, she understood that it was a marriage certificate of the Accused and Dianey. (An English translation of the document was produced at the trial).
[note: 50]
 It was submitted on behalf of the Accused that he and Dianey had contracted a Muslim marriage in Pattani, Thailand evidenced in a Marriage Licence No 09383.
[note: 51]
53     As I have mentioned, neither the Accused nor Dianey told the investigation officers that they were married, and neither of them had a copy of the marriage certificate in their possession. Dianey’s recollection was that they were married in a mosque in Kelantan, not in Pattani, Thailand. They only asserted that they were married after the curious certificate came to light through Normalah.
54     In view of the unorthodox manner in which the certificate surfaced, some investigations was clearly necessary. The defence, while relying on the marriage certificate produced by Normalah as proof of the marriage, did not take the initiative to verify the authenticity of the document. It was the prosecution which did that. A letter was sent to the Royal Thai Embassy in Singapore, forwarding a copy of the certificate and seeking confirmation if it was genuine and issued in Thailand and recognised under Thai law.
[note: 52]
 The response from the Embassy was that:
[note: 53]
… The Islamic Council of Pattani Province has confirmed the certificate of marriage Book No. LL 0376 No. 09383 between Muhammad Nor Sallehin Bin Kamaruzaman and Nur Dianey Binti Mohamed Salim is in fact 
a counterfeit document
.
[emphasis in original]
55     Although the defence was informed of the correspondence, it did not follow up on it or undertake any investigations of its own.
56     The alleged marriage and the certificate had to be proved by the defence in compliance with the Evidence Act. Section 80(1)(
g
) of the Evidence Act requires a public document in a foreign country be proved:
by the original or by a copy certified by the legal keeper thereof, with a certificate under the seal of a notary public or of a consular officer of Singapore that the copy is duly certified by the officer having the legal custody of the original and upon proof of the character of the document according to the law of the foreign country.
57     In this case, the marriage was not proved; and, to the contrary, there was authoritative confirmation that the mysterious certificate was a counterfeit. Consequently, I find that there was no marriage; and even if there was a marriage, it did not have any effect on the admissibility of the evidence of Dianey relating to the offence.

Judgment reserved.
 Choo Han Teck J:
1       Both applicants applied to this court to consider whether the death sentence meted out to them on 22 April 2010 ought to be substituted with a sentence of life imprisonment, under s 27(6) of the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act 2012 (Act 30 of 2012).
2       The grounds for the applications of both applicants were similarly based on s 33B(3)(
b
) read with s 33B(3) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”). Both applicants claimed to be suffering from an abnormality of mind, as defined in this provision, which substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts and omissions. In order to escape the death sentence under s 33B, both applicants also had to prove that they were couriers only. The prosecution did not dispute that Pausi was a courier but denied that Roslan was one.
3       Counsel for the applicant in Criminal Motion No. 45 of 2016 (“Pausi”), Mr Chung Ting Fai, submitted that his client had an arrested or retarded development of mind as a result of his exceptionally low and restricted education. He further submitted that Pausi does not possess the average reasoning abilities to think through his actions and consequences thoroughly. Pausi’s expert, Mr Danny Ng, assessed Pausi’s IQ to be at 67, which would be a mild intellectual disability. According to Mr Chung, the low intelligence of Pausi made him “incapable of resisting any internal rationality that might have dissuaded him from committing the offence”.
4       Counsel for the applicant in Criminal Motion No. 40 of 2016 (“Roslan”), Mr Kertar Singh, submitted that his client was a courier and denied that he gave instructions to another to retrieve and deliver the drugs. Mr Singh argued that his client suffered from an abnormality of mind as he had reduced intellectual functioning. He also relied on the experts’ opinion that his client had “limited capacity for judgment, decision-making, consequential thinking, impulse control and executive function” due to the underlying cognitive defects. The learned DPP, Ms Christina Koh challenged these findings on various grounds, such as the language used by the defence experts in conducting the psychiatric assessments as well as the limitations of the prison setting under which they were conducted. She argued that Roslan was within the borderline range of intellectual functioning, relying on the testimony of IMH psychiatrists, which she submitted was more accurate.
5       Counsel for prosecution and the applicants could not agree as to how the IQ levels of the two applicants ought to be interpreted. Ms Koh maintained that the IQ score alone, is not conclusive because it only assesses cognitive abilities but not one’s adaptive functioning abilities.
6       I am of the view that the IQ level of both applicants in this case does not assist them. In some cases, the IQ level may offer corroborative support, but here, the conduct of both applicants were amply shown through the evidence at trial including their own testimonies, that they were functioning in ways no different from people with higher IQ level in relation to the drug offences. Significantly, Roslan was the central figure in the drug transaction. He directed the actions of the others involved and orchestrated its moving parts. Pausi was able to deliver the drugs from outside Singapore and participated in the operation with little difficulty. That conduct and behaviour, cannot be regarded as that of affecting their culpability. A low IQ level alone is not evidence of an abnormality of mind.
7       I find on the evidence at trial that Pausi was probably acting only as a courier but I am satisfied that Roslan was not. This finding is for completeness in dealing with their applications before me. It does not affect the verdict because neither applicant succeeded in proving the second criterion of s 33B(3) of the MDA.
8       For the purposes of s 33B(3), the court cannot ignore the functionality of the mind of an accused person in question. In this case, I find that despite a low score, both applicants had displayed competence and comprehension of what they were doing when they carried out their act of trafficking in the drugs.
9       Their applications for re-sentencing are therefore dismissed.",2017-11-13 00:00:00,SG High Court

 Chan Seng Onn J:
Introduction
1       This is a joint trial of two accused persons who have been accused of bringing a total of nine bundles of diamorphine into Singapore from Malaysia in a lorry driven by the second accused person, Chander Kumar a/l Jayagaran (“Chander”). The first accused person, Ramesh a/l Perumal (“Ramesh”), was a passenger in the said lorry. When in Singapore, the accused persons parted ways. Ramesh was arrested shortly after with four of the bundles in his possession; Chander was arrested with two of the bundles in his possession, after having delivered three of the bundles to one Harun bin Idris (“Harun”).
2       Ramesh faces a single charge under s 5(1)(
a
) read with s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the MDA”) for having in his possession not less than 29.96g of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking without any authorisation under the MDA. Chander faces the following three charges:
(a)     one charge under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA for having in his possession not less than 14.79g of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking without any authorisation under the MDA;
(b)     one charge under s 5(1)(
a
) of the MDA for trafficking in not less than 19.27g of diamorphine by delivering three bundles of diamorphine to Harun without any authorisation under the MDA; and
(c)     one charge under s 5(1)(
a
) of the MDA for trafficking in not less than 29.96g of diamorphine by delivering four bundles of diamorphine to Ramesh without any authorisation under the MDA.
3       Both accused persons claimed trial to their charges. Ramesh contests his charge by essentially arguing that he did not know that the bag that Chander had passed to him contained the four bundles of diamorphine that he is being charged for; instead, he thought that the bag contained office documents. As for Chander, he argues that he did not know that the nine bundles of diamorphine that are the subject of his charges contained diamorphine; rather, he thought that the bundles contained betel nuts.
4       At the end of the joint trial, I reserved judgment. I now set out my decision and the accompanying reasons.
The undisputed facts
5       Ramesh, a 39-year-old Malaysian national, and Chander, a 40-year-old Malaysian national, both work as drivers for Millennium Transport Agency, a transport company based in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, which handles deliveries in Singapore.
[note: 1]
6       On 26 June 2013, at or about 7.40am, Chander and Ramesh arrived together at Woodlands Checkpoint, Singapore, from Malaysia in a delivery lorry bearing registration number JNS 2583 (“the first lorry”), which was driven by Chander. After entering Singapore, Chander drove to a location along Woodlands Road, Singapore, where another delivery lorry bearing registration number JMG 7398 (“the second lorry”) was parked. Ramesh alighted from the first lorry and boarded the second lorry. Both accused persons then drove off separately.
[note: 2]
7       At or about 8.30am on the same day, officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) spotted Chander stopping the first lorry close to the food centre at 20 Marsiling Lane, where Harun and one Tang Chee Sun (“Tang”) were waiting. Harun approached the first lorry and opened the door of the front passenger side of the lorry. Chander informed Harun that his items were on the passenger’s side of the lorry. Harun then retrieved a white plastic bag (“E1”), which contained three bundles wrapped in black tape (“E1A”, “E1B” and “E1C”; collectively, “the E bundles”), from the floor of the passenger’s side of the first lorry, placed an envelope and a stack of cash on the passenger seat, and left. Chander then drove off from the location.
[note: 3]
8       At about 8.45am, Chander arrived just outside the premises of Sankyu (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“Sankyu”) at 11 Clementi Loop, where he was arrested by CNB officers shortly after at about 8.55am.
[note: 4]
 The officers searched the first lorry and seized the following items:
[note: 5]
(a)     one bundle wrapped in black tape, recovered from the area between the driver and passenger seats (“A1”);
(b)     one bundle wrapped in black tape, recovered from a compartment under the radio (“B1”); and
(c)     cash amounting to S$6,950 (“C1”) and one Nokia 110 mobile phone (“CKJ-HP1”), both recovered from the compartment above the driver’s seat.
A1 and B1 shall be collectively referred to as “the AB bundles”. The officers also searched Chander and seized another Nokia 110 mobile phone (“CKJ-HP2”), recovered from the right pocket of his pants.
[note: 6]
9       Shortly after, at or about 9.00am, Ramesh stopped the second lorry at the same location at 11 Clementi Loop. He was arrested by CNB officers while walking towards the premises of Sankyu after alighting from the second lorry.
[note: 7]
 The officers proceeded to search the second lorry, and seized a blue bag (“D1”) from the area between the driver and passenger seats. Within the bag, there was a white plastic bag (“D1A”), which contained four bundles wrapped in black tape (“D1A1”, “D1A2”, “D1A3” and “D1A4”; collectively, “the D bundles”).
[note: 8]
10     All the seized bundles were submitted to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis. In summary, the following findings were made:
[note: 9]
(a)     The AB bundles, which together contained not less than 460.3g of granular/powdery substance, were found to contain not less than 14.79g of diamorphine.
(b)     The D bundles, which together contained not less than 923g of granular/powdery substance, were found to contain not less than 29.96g of diamorphine.
(c)     The E bundles, which together contained not less than 688.5g of granular/powdery substance, were found to contain not less than 19.27g of diamorphine.
Diamorphine is a Class A controlled drug listed under the First Schedule to the MDA.
11     Tests run by the HSA on the blood samples obtained from both accused persons further revealed that Ramesh’s deoxyribonucleic acid (“DNA”) was found on the adhesive sides of the tape used to wrap exhibit D1A2.
[note: 10]
Statements recorded from the accused persons
12     In the course of investigations, the CNB officers recorded six statements from Ramesh, which comprised:
(a)     one contemporaneous statement recorded pursuant to s 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”) on 26 June 2013 at 9.40am;
[note: 11]
(b)     one cautioned statement recorded pursuant to s 23 of the CPC on 26 June 2013, 11.06pm to 11.20pm;
[note: 12]
 and
(c)     four long statements recorded pursuant to s 22 of the CPC on 30 June 2013 (“P98”), 2 July 2013 (“P100”), 3 July 2013 (“P102”) and 24 April 2014 (“P104”) respectively.
[note: 13]
13     As for Chander, the CNB officers recorded ten statements, which comprised:
(a)     two contemporaneous statements recorded pursuant to s 22 of the CPC on 26 June 2013 at 9.42am and 11.37am respectively;
[note: 14]
(b)     three cautioned statements recorded pursuant to s 23 of the CPC on: (i) 27 June 2013, 12.25am to 12.35am (“P94”); (ii) 27 June 2013, 1.06am to 1.12am (“P95”); and (iii) 27 June 2013, 1.40am to 2.05am (“P96”) respectively;
[note: 15]
 and
(c)     five long statements recorded pursuant to s 22 of the CPC on 29 June 2013 (“P97”), 1 July 2013 (“P99”), 2 July 2013 (“P101”), 3 July 2013 (“P103”) and 30 April 2014 (“P105”) respectively.
[note: 16]
14     Neither of the accused persons disputes the voluntariness of any of the statements.
Ramesh
15     In his contemporaneous statement recorded on the day he was arrested, Ramesh said that Chander had passed him D1 “at about 7 plus” on 26 June 2013, asked him to hold on to D1, and instructed Ramesh to pass D1 back to him after 1pm on the same day. He also claimed that this was the first time that Chander had ever told him to hold onto a bag. Crucially, Ramesh further stated that he had asked Chander what was in the bag, to which Chander replied that “there is company item inside” that “he wants to bring back to Malaysia”. However, Ramesh claimed that he did not open D1 to check its contents, and that he had never seen the D bundles before.
[note: 17]
16     In his cautioned statement recorded on the same day, Ramesh stated that Chander gave him a bag, 
ie
, D1, and asked him to keep it in the second lorry. What was noteworthy was that Ramesh stated that he received a call at 8.30am from someone asking him “where is the bag”, to which Ramesh replied that he did not know. Ramesh also received another call at about 8.40am from a Malaysian number asking him in Tamil “work finish?”, to which he replied “what work”. The Malaysian caller then hung up.
[note: 18]
17     In P98, Ramesh gave an extensive account of the events leading up to his arrest. The following portions are worth highlighting:
(a)     He was instructed by his employer on the night of 25 June 2013 to hitch a ride from Chander the next day into Singapore and use the second lorry parked in Woodlands to collect some documents from Sankyu at 11 Clementi Loop and other items from various other locations.
[note: 19]
 On 26 June 2013, at about 5.30am, he hitched a motorcycle ride from his friend, one Murugan, who was an old friend from another transport company that he used to work for, to his office. According to Ramesh, although he usually does not hitch a ride from Murugan, he decided to do so on that day as he “was afraid [that Chander] might be late for work”. However, in the same breath, Ramesh also said that “[Chander] is habitually late for work”. Ramesh reached his office at 5.40am, while Chander arrived ten minutes after. They set off for Woodlands Checkpoint at about 6.15am, and arrived at about 7.20am.
[note: 20]
(b)     They arrived at the location where the second lorry was parked at about 7.40am. While Ramesh was alighting from the first lorry, he claimed that Chander gave him a blue bag, 
ie
, D1, and “told [him] to keep the bag till [they] were done with [their] collection at Keppel Distripark”. Ramesh claimed that he was confused as he “did not know why he would want to give [him] his bag”. According to Ramesh, he only saw D1 when Chander wanted to pass it to him. Ramesh asked Chander why he gave him D1. In response, Chander told him “to help him keep the bag as it contained some office documents”. Ramesh felt that D1 was heavy and hence again asked Chander what was in D1. Chander again replied that it contained office documents. After Chander drove off in the first lorry, Ramesh opened the door of the second lorry and “threw the bag onto the space beside the driver seat”. Ramesh then drove off at about 8am.
[note: 21]
(c)     While Ramesh was driving the second lorry, he claimed to have received a phone call from a Malaysian number, during which the male caller asked him in Tamil “if the work has been completed”. Ramesh asked in return “what work he was referring to and who he was”. The caller then hung up abruptly. About ten minutes later, at about 8.40am, Ramesh then received a call from a Singapore number, during which the male caller told him in English that “I am at Cheng Meng”. Ramesh claimed that he “was not really sure what he meant by this”, and hence asked the caller what he meant. The caller once again hung up abruptly.
[note: 22]
(d)     Subsequently, after Ramesh arrived at Sankyu at 11 Clementi Loop, he was arrested by CNB officers while walking towards the Sankyu premises after alighting from the second lorry. Ramesh was brought to the lorry and asked what he had inside. Ramesh responded by informing the officers that he had “some company documents and a bag”. The officers then opened the door of the second lorry, retrieved D1, and asked Ramesh what was inside the bag. Ramesh answered that he “did not know what was inside”. When the officers emptied the contents of D1 to reveal the D bundles and informed Ramesh that they could be drugs, Ramesh claimed to feel “shocked”.
[note: 23]
18     In P100, Ramesh reiterated that he received two calls in the morning of 26 June 2013 – one from a Malaysian number and one from a Singapore number. However, Ramesh also stated that after he had received those two calls, he also received a call from Chander, who called to check on his delivery status. After this call from Chander, Ramesh then claimed to receive another call from the same Malaysian number that he had earlier received the first call from. The caller remained silent throughout the call this time. Ramesh hung up after the caller failed to respond.
[note: 24]
19     Finally, in P104, Ramesh stated – after being shown the HSA test results revealing that Ramesh’s DNA was found on the adhesive sides of the tape used to wrap exhibit D1A2 – that during the journey on the first lorry, he recalled using his hand to reach down and push aside an object that “came out from the dashboard compartment beside [his] leg”.
[note: 25]
 Specifically, he had felt uncomfortable as the object was hitting his leg during the journey, and hence he “grasped [the object] in [his] hand using [his] fingers and moved it aside”.
[note: 26]
 However, he “could not clearly see what [he had] pushed aside” as it was dark. After pushing aside the object, he went back to sleep.
[note: 27]
Chander
20     In his two contemporaneous statements recorded on 26 June 2013, Chander stated that A1 was passed to him from “[s]omeone on top in Malaysia” for him to “give [to] one Malay person” who would contact him later, and that B1 was also passed to him from “[t]he person on top” for him deliver to “the person that wants to take the thing”, who would also contact him later. Chander also stated that he had passed “[f]our bundles” to Ramesh, while he had passed “[t]hree” bundles to Harun in exchange for “7 thousand [dollars]”. When asked how many times he had previously “done this kind of work sending things”, Chander stated that he had done this “[o]nly three times in a period of two months.
[note: 28]
21     In his three cautioned statements, 
ie
, P94, P95 and P96, Chander purported to admit to all three charges that were served on him. As the statements are extremely material to my decision, it is useful for me to set them out in full. First, P94, which was recorded in relation to the charge under s 5(1)(
a
) read with s 5(2) of the MDA for having in his possession the AB bundles of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking, reads as follows:
[note: 29]
 
I admit to the charge
. I need to support my aged parents my wife and 6 children. My eldest daughter is 15 years and my youngest child is 4 months old. I’m the sole breadwinner of the family. I will give my full cooperation to CNB in order to arrest the supplier. Even after my sentence, after I go back to Malaysia I shall still render my assistance to CNB to catch the culprits who do this. I plead for leniency and a very light sentence. This is my first offence and I will never do it again. I did it because I have heavy debts to pay. My father is a heart patient and my mother suffers from diabetes.
[emphasis added]
Next, P95, which was recorded in relation to the charge under s 5(1)(
a
) for trafficking in diamorphine by delivering the E bundles of diamorphine to Harun, reads as follows:
[note: 30]
 
I admit to the charge
. I will never do it again. I plead for mercy and light sentence. I need to support my aged parents who are also sick, my wife and my 6 children who are very young. They all depend on me. I am remorseful for what I have done. Please give me a chance. I will give my full cooperation to CNB authorities.
[emphasis added]
Finally, P96, which was recorded in relation to the charge under s 5(1)(
a
) for trafficking in diamorphine by delivering the D bundles of diamorphine to Ramesh, reads as follows:
[note: 31]
 
I admit to the charge
, however I wish to state that 
I gave the 4 bundles to him after he asked for his share of 4 bundles which was given to him by the Malaysian supplier
. The Malaysian supplier gave the 4 bundles because he wanted to do the job. However since Ramesh lorry was parked in Singapore, he came with me in the same lorry from Johor Bahru. 
That was the reason why his share of the drugs was also in my lorry, which I subsequently handed over to him
. Please try to help me reunite with my family. I will never do this mistake again. I am remorseful for what I did. I plead for mercy. I am the sole breadwinner of my family.
[emphasis added]
22     In P97, P99, P101 and P103, Chander gave a detailed account of the events leading up to his arrest. The material portions are summarised as follows:
(a)     About four months before his arrest, Chander was first approached by one Roy, a Malaysian Indian man living in his estate, to deliver undeclared betel nuts (also known as “pakku” in Tamil and “pinang” in Malay). Chander agreed to do so and hence in May 2013, he helped to deliver one bundle of betel nuts to Harun. Harun passed Chander an envelope containing money in exchange, which Chander in turn passed to Roy at a coffee shop near his office. Roy counted the money in the envelope in front of Chander. Chander was paid RM250 for the delivery.
[note: 32]
(b)     On the night of 25 June 2013, Roy approached Chander and requested him to help make another delivery of betel nuts. Roy stated that Chander was to deliver “3 small bundles to one person, 4 small bundles to another person, and 2 small bundles to another person”. Specifically, the first three bundles were meant for delivery at Woodlands, the next four bundles were meant for delivery at Bedok, and he would be told where to deliver the last two bundles subsequently. Chander was initially reluctant, but eventually agreed. Chander enlisted Ramesh to help with the delivery of the set of four bundles. Likewise, Ramesh was initially reluctant, but eventually agreed. Chander assumed that Roy agreed to place the bundles in the basket of Chander’s motorcycle.
[note: 33]
(c)     On 26 June 2013, Chander met Ramesh, who stayed in the same estate as Chander, at about 5.45am at his motorcycle. At that time, Chander observed that the nine bundles had already been neatly separated into three separate plastic bags of four bundles, three bundles and two bundles respectively, and stacked in the motorcycle basket. Chander gave Ramesh a lift to their office on his motorcycle. While Ramesh helped to park Chander’s motorcycle, Chander pulled open the cover of the dashboard at the front of the first lorry and placed the plastic bags containing all nine bundles inside the compartment. At that time, Ramesh did not see where Chander had kept the bundles. However, Chandra told Ramesh where the bundles were kept while they were on the causeway, having passed the Malaysia customs.
[note: 34]
(d)     After they cleared the immigration checkpoint at about 7.30am, Chander drove them to the location where the second lorry was parked. There, Chander “told Ramesh to open the dashboard and take the 4 bundles that were meant for him”. Ramesh asked Chander how he should keep the four bundles. Hence, Chander instructed him to take his “blue SG brand bag”, 
ie
, D1, and place the plastic bag, 
ie
, D1A, containing the four bundles, 
ie
, the D bundles, into D1.
[note: 35]
 Ramesh then asked Chander “what to do with the rest of the bundles”. In response, Chander told Ramesh to take out the set of three bundles and place the bundles on the floor of the cabin, and leave the remaining two bundles inside the dashboard. After Ramesh left the first lorry, Chander drove off and stopped at a heavy vehicle car park at Admiralty Road West to await further instructions.
[note: 36]
(e)     Subsequently, at about 8.05am, Chander received a call from a Malaysian number. The caller, who spoke in Tamil, introduced himself as Roy’s friend and instructed Chander to deliver four, instead of three, bundles to the next recipient. Chander thus took out one bundle from the dashboard compartment and placed it together with the three bundles that had earlier been placed on the floor by Ramesh. A few minutes later, Chander received a call from a Singaporean number. The caller, who spoke in Malay, arranged to meet Chander at the market at 20 Marsiling Lane. Then, Roy’s friend contacted Chander again, informing him that the next recipient would be giving him some money.
[note: 37]
(f)     As Chander was driving towards 20 Marsiling Lane, the Singaporean caller again contacted Chander, informing Chander that he was once again to deliver only three bundles to the next recipient. Chander thus removed one bundle, 
ie
, A1, from the existing pile and placed it in the area between the driver’s seat and the passenger’s seat.
[note: 38]
(g)     Chander reached 20 Marsiling Lane at about 8.20am. There, Harun, who was waiting alongside Tang, opened the passenger door of the lorry, collected the E bundles from the floor of the passenger’s side of the lorry, placed an envelope containing a stack of cash and a separate bundle of notes tied with a rubber band on the passenger seat, and left. Chander then drove off from the location. While driving, he received a call from Roy’s friend, who asked if he had taken the money and instructed him to count the money. Chander then counted the money while he was driving, and realised that it came up to S$7,000. Chander wondered to himself “how can ‘pinang’ cost so much”, and also expressed this concern to Roy’s friend, who had called again. Roy’s friend claimed that the money was debt for a previous shipment. After counting the money, Chander tied all the notes up with the same rubber band and placed them, 
ie
, C1, in the compartment above the driver’s seat. Roy’s friend also informed Chander that the remaining two bundles, 
ie
, the AB bundles, were to be delivered to someone riding a black motorcycle and wearing a red shirt. Chander arranged to meet the recipient at 11 Clementi Loop.
[note: 39]
(h)     While driving towards 11 Clementi Loop, Chander placed C1 at the compartment above the driver’s seat. Chander then received an SMS from Roy’s friend with the contact number of a Chinese man, who was supposed to be the last recipient. Shortly after Chander arrived in front of Sankyu at 11 Clementi Loop, he was arrested by CNB officers.
[note: 40]
The applicable legal principles
23     Before turning to consider the submissions advanced by the parties and the evidence adduced during trial, I first set out the applicable legal principles that govern the charges faced by the accused persons.
24     Section 5(1)(
a
) read with s 5(2) of the MDA provide as follows:
 
Trafficking in controlled drugs
 
 
5.
—(1) Except as authorised by this Act, it shall be an offence for a person, on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person, whether or not that other person is in Singapore —
(
a
)    to traffic in a controlled drug;
…
(2)    For the purposes of this Act, a person commits the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug if he has in his possession that drug for the purpose of trafficking.
Under s 2 of the MDA, “traffic” is defined to mean “to sell, 
give
, administer, transport, send, 
deliver
 or distribute” [emphasis added], or “to offer to do” any of those actions.
25     In order to make out an offence of trafficking in a controlled drug under s 5(1)(
a
) of the MDA, the Prosecution must prove: (a) trafficking, without authorisation, in a controlled drug; and (b) knowledge of the nature of the controlled drug, which may be proved or presumed pursuant to s 18(2). If an accused person is merely found to be in possession of the controlled drug, but a trafficking charge is brought under s 5(1)(
a
) read with s 5(2) of the MDA, the elements that must be established are: (a) possession of a controlled drug, which may be proved or presumed pursuant to s 18(1); (b) knowledge of the nature of the drug, which may be proved or presumed pursuant to s 18(2); and (c) that possession of the drug was for the purpose of trafficking which was not authorised.
26     Given that the Prosecution invokes the presumptions of possession and knowledge under ss 18(1)(
a
) and 18(2) of the MDA respectively, I set out the sub-provisions as follows:
 
Presumption of possession and knowledge of controlled drugs
 
 
18.
—(1) Any person who is proved to have had in his possession or custody or under his control —
(
a
)     anything containing a controlled drug;
…
shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have had that drug in his possession.
(2)     Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have known the nature of that drug.
27     Under s 18(1)(
a
) of the MDA, the accused is presumed to possess the drugs that are contained in a particular thing as long as the Prosecution is able to prove that the thing in issue exists and that the accused has possession, control or custody of the thing in issue. This presumption is rebutted if the accused is able to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he did not have the drugs in his possession. The clearest way in which the accused can accomplish this is by establishing that he did not know that the thing in issue contained the drug in question (
eg
, the drug was slipped into his bag without his knowledge). If the presumption under s 18(1)(
a
) has been successfully rebutted by the accused, the Prosecution would have failed to prove that the accused was in possession of the drug. See 
Obeng Comfort v Public Prosecutor
 
[2017] 1 SLR 633
 (“
Obeng Comfort
”) at [34]–[36].
28     The presumption under s 18(2) that the accused has knowledge of the nature of the drug would be invoked if an accused is either (a) proved to have had the controlled drug in his possession, or (b) presumed under s 18(1) of the MDA to have had the controlled drug in his possession and this presumption is not rebutted. This presumption is rebutted if the accused is able to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he did not have knowledge of the nature of the controlled drug, which refers to the specific controlled drug found in his possession. The accused can do so by showing that he did not know or could not reasonably be expected to have known the nature of the controlled drug. Practically speaking, this entails the accused explaining what he thought or believed he was carrying, which could either be something innocuous or a controlled drug other than the one found on him. The court will assess the credibility and veracity of the accused’s account against the objective facts, in the light of the item that the accused thought he was carrying. It would not be possible for the accused to rebut the presumption where the Prosecution is able to prove that the accused was acting with actual knowledge or wilful blindness (
ie
, where the accused had the appropriate level of suspicion but deliberately refused to inquire into the facts to investigate further). See 
Obeng Comfort
 ([27] 
supra
) at [35]–[40], 
Masoud Rahimi bin Mehrzad v Public Prosecutor and another appeal
 
[2017] 1 SLR 257
 at [55] and 
Muhammad Ridzuan bin Md Ali v Public Prosecutor and other matters
 
[2014] 3 SLR 721
 at [75]–[76].
29     I now turn to apply these principles to the facts of this case.
My decision
30     Having carefully considered all the material before me, I find that the Prosecution has proven the elements of all the charges against both Ramesh and Chander beyond reasonable doubt. I shall now proceed to furnish my detailed reasons for their convictions.
Ramesh 
31     Ramesh faces a single charge under s 5(1)(
a
) read with s 5(2) of the MDA for having the diamorphine in the D bundles in his possession for the purpose of trafficking.
32     The Prosecution’s case against Ramesh may be summarised thus:
[note: 41]
(a)     First, possession is made out. Chander’s evidence – that Ramesh had placed the D bundles into D1 and left the first lorry with D1 – directly proves Ramesh’s possession of the D bundles. Alternatively, the Prosecution relies on the presumption of possession under s 18(1)(
a
) of the MDA, which arises by virtue of Ramesh’s own admission that Chander had passed D1 to him and that D1 was in his possession.
(b)     Second, knowledge of the nature of the drugs is satisfied. In this respect, the Prosecution relies on the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA and argues that given that Ramesh has been proven or presumed to have had in his possession the D bundles, Ramesh is presumed to have known that the D bundles contained diamorphine.
(c)     Third, the requirement for the possession of the drugs to be “for the purpose of trafficking” is made out by Chander’s evidence that Ramesh was supposed to deliver the D bundles to a recipient in Bedok. Alternatively, Ramesh’s own admission that he was going to return D1 and its contents to Chander would also satisfy the definition of “traffic” under s 2 of the MDA.
33     In response, Ramesh essentially asserts that although Chander had indeed passed D1 to him, he did not know that there were controlled drugs found inside D1. He had asked Chander what was inside D1, and Chander replied by stating that D1 merely contained office documents. This directly contradicts Chander’s evidence that Chander had told him to put the D bundles into D1.
[note: 42]
34     Ramesh submits in closing that the evidence adduced in this regard goes towards rebutting the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA.
[note: 43]
 With respect, I find this submission to be misguided. I think the evidence adduced by Ramesh goes towards showing that possession under s 5(2) of the MDA is not made out, by introducing a reasonable doubt as to his possession of diamorphine, and also by rebutting the s 18(1)(
a
) presumption of possession. If Ramesh succeeds in that regard, then the knowledge element would also not be satisfied because if possession can be neither proved nor presumed, the Prosecution may not invoke the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2).
35     In my view, the Prosecution has managed to establish beyond reasonable doubt all three elements of the single charge against Ramesh.
Whether Ramesh was in possession of the D bundles
36     It is evident from Ramesh’s case that whether Ramesh was in possession of the D bundles is the main issue in contention (see [33] above). I accept the Prosecution’s submission that Ramesh was in possession of the D bundles.
(1)   Positive proof of possession
37     While there was no doubt that Ramesh was physically in possession of D1, and accordingly, the D bundles, Ramesh submitted that he did not know that the D bundles were in D1. In my view, the Prosecution is able to positively prove beyond reasonable doubt that Ramesh was in possession of the D bundles because the evidence given by Chander shows that Ramesh knew that the D bundles were in D1.
38     At trial, Chander testified that he had specifically told Ramesh how he had kept all nine bundles, which had been neatly packed into three separate plastic bags, in the dashboard compartment at the front of the first lorry. Chander also gave evidence that after they had arrived at the location where the second lorry was parked, Chander had instructed Ramesh to open the dashboard and retrieve the four bundles that were meant for him to deliver, 
ie
, the D bundles. When Ramesh asked Chander how he should keep the four bundles, Chander further instructed Ramesh to place the D bundles into D1. During examination-in-chief by his counsel, Chander testified as follows:
[note: 44]
Q
All right. And then---so after you cleared Malaysian Customs, what happened next?
A
And after the Malaysian Customs at the Causeway, 
I told Ramesh that I placed the 
jaman

When you say you placed the 
jaman
 here, where are you referring to?
A

 labelled B.
…
Q
All right. And what happened next?
A
After clearing the Customs, we entered into Singapore. No checking was done. I have been driving lorry for a very long time but on that day the Customs was very unusual. It was unusually quiet. Someone whom I do not know, he was standing at the boot and he was looking at my lorry. And I did not bother about it and I continued in my journey. 
At Kranji Road, I made a U-turn at Turf Club and that was when I told Ramesh to open up the dashboard and to take out four bundles
. 
He took it and he asked me where to put it and I told him---and I told him to put it inside my bag. And he asked me about the rest of the bundles and I told him to take three bundles and to place it on the floor.
 After that, I dropped him and he went off with the bag.
[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold]
Chander’s evidence remained largely consistent during cross-examination by counsel for Ramesh. The relevant portion of Chander’s testimony is reproduced as follows:
[note: 45]
Q
So when you arrived at Woodlands, when Ramesh was about to alight from the lorry, what did you tell Ramesh?
A
I told Ramesh to check his lorry.
Q
What about the bundles?
A
He---he has---he took it and has gotten down.
Q
 
Did you tell him to take the bundles?
 
A
Yes, I told him to take.

Q
How would he know which are his four bundles? You---sorry.
A
Roy told me that he had separated the bundles---he had separated the bundles into four, three and two.
Q
 
So how did Ramesh go about taking out these bundles?
 
A
 
He opened the dashboard and took out the bag. He took four bundles and he asked me about the rest of the bundles. And I told him to place three bundles on the floor. And he asked me how to bring these four bundles and I told him to put it inside my bag.
 
Q
This is your personal bag?
A
Yes.
Q
 
So you are saying that Ramesh took a plastic bag which contained four bundles?
 
A
 
Yes.
 
[emphasis added in bold]
39     On the whole, I find the account provided by Chander in this regard to be reliable because his evidence is both internally and externally consistent. That Chander’s evidence is internally consistent is evident from how the specific account of events provided at trial is consistent with the evidence that Chander provided during investigations in both P97 and P99 (see [22(c)]–[22(d)] above).
[note: 46]
40     Chander’s evidence is also externally consistent, given that his account implicating Ramesh is corroborated by other pieces of evidence adduced at trial. First, it was undisputed that HSA tests showed that Ramesh’s DNA was found on the adhesive sides of the tape used to wrap D1A2 (see [11] above).
[note: 47]
 This supports Chander’s description of how it was Ramesh who had placed the D bundles into D1. The logical inference to draw from this is that Ramesh’s DNA could have accidentally been transferred onto the adhesive sides of the tape wrapping D1A2 when Ramesh was checking to see which of the three plastic bags hidden in the dashboard compartment was the plastic bag containing the D bundles.
41     I accept the Prosecution’s submission that Ramesh’s DNA could not have been transferred onto D1A2 due to events occurring 
after
 Ramesh’s arrest. After Ramesh was arrested, a grip restraint and a face mask were both placed on him while a search of the second lorry by the CNB officers was conducted in the presence of Ramesh.
[note: 48]
 D1 was only retrieved from the lorry during the search. I thus found it extremely unlikely that Ramesh’s DNA was transferred to D1A2 after his arrest.
42     I reject Ramesh’s attempts to discredit the corroborative DNA evidence for the following reasons:
(a)     First, Ramesh’s explanation that his DNA was transferred when he was brushing the bundles away from his leg while he was in the first lorry driven by Chander should be dismissed as a mere afterthought. Ramesh offered this explanation only when recording P104, which was a long statement recorded on 24 April 2014, after he had been confronted with the HSA test results (see [19] above). I also found Ramesh’s explanation to be inherently incredible. In this regard, I accepted the evidence of the HSA analyst Tang Sheau Wei June, who testified that if a person had merely touched the outside of a plastic bag, it would theoretically not be possible for his DNA to be found on the adhesive side of the bundles 
inside
 that plastic bag.
[note: 49]
(b)     Next, Ramesh’s suggestion that his DNA could have been transferred to D1A2 due to contamination during the handling of the exhibits is fanciful at best. D1A2 could not have been contaminated at the place of arrest because Ramesh’s belongings had been seized and placed in tamper-proof bags even before D1 was found.
[note: 50]
 D1A2 also could not have been contaminated when it was being sent to the HSA for testing because the HSA analyst only received drug exhibits that were individually sealed in tamper-proof bags.
[note: 51]
 It is thus evidently impossible for the handling of the exhibits at any stage to have resulted in Ramesh’s DNA being transferred to D1A2.
43     Second, another piece of corroborative evidence is Ramesh’s own actions when he was questioned by Senior Station Inspector David Ng (“PW45”) immediately after his arrest. PW45 testified in his written statement that when he first took over custody of Ramesh from another CNB officer, he “asked [Ramesh] if he had anything illegal inside the [second lorry]. Ramesh replied ‘one bag’ in English”.
[note: 52]
 PW45 also stated that when the second lorry was being searched in Ramesh’s presence, he “asked Ramesh in English ‘where is the illegal thing?’ and [Ramesh] replied ‘middle’ in English, while using his head to point to the area between the driver and the passenger seat”.
[note: 53]
 It is undisputed that the item identified by Ramesh at that instant was D1. This evidence was consistent with PW45’s evidence during his examination-in-chief,
[note: 54]
 and remained unshaken during cross-examination by counsel for Ramesh.
[note: 55]
 To my mind, the fact that Ramesh associated D1 with something “illegal” is highly indicative of his actual knowledge that D1 contained the D bundles.
44     Finally, I also find it telling that Ramesh himself acted furtively in attempting to conceal D1 before leaving the second lorry. PW45 stated in his written statement that when the CNB officers were searching the second lorry in the presence of Ramesh, he “saw a bag partially hidden behind a pillow which was placed between the driver and passenger seat”.
[note: 56]
 This was confirmed by PW45 on the stand during examination-in-chief, when he clarified that D1 was “partially hidden” between the driver seat and the passenger seat behind the pillow, which was “leaning backwards”.
[note: 57]
 During cross-examination by counsel for Ramesh, PW45’s evidence was unshaken – he maintained that when searching the second lorry, he “saw a bag partially hidden behind a pillow”.
[note: 58]
 Given that Ramesh’s evidence is that after receiving D1 from Chander, he just “threw the bag onto the space beside the driver seat”,
[note: 59]
 the logical inference that should be drawn from the position in which PW45 saw D1 is that Ramesh attempted to hide D1 by covering it with the pillow before leaving the second lorry. When Ramesh was cross-examined by the Deputy Public Prosecutor (“DPP”) at trial on this point, he initially denied covering D1 with a pillow.
[note: 60]
 It was only after questioning by the court that Ramesh relented and conceded that the person placing D1 behind the pillow “could have been” him, and that he “[did] not know clearly” whether it was him.
[note: 61]
 I agree with the Prosecution that there would have been no reason for Ramesh to have attempted to conceal D1 in this manner – behind a pillow between the driver’s seat and the passenger’s seat of the second lorry – if he did not in fact know that D1 contained the D bundles.
45     I pause at this juncture to briefly address the Prosecution’s submission regarding the admissibility of P96, which is Chander’s third cautioned statement. The Prosecution argues that the court should take P96 into consideration as against Ramesh pursuant to s 258(5) of the CPC.
[note: 62]
 In P96, Chander stated that he had passed Ramesh the D bundles after Ramesh specifically asked for his share of the drugs which had been given to him by the Malaysian supplier, and that the Malaysian supplier had passed Ramesh the D bundles because this was a job that he wanted to do. Chander also explained that Ramesh’s share of the drugs was in Chander’s lorry, and was only subsequently handed over by Chander to Ramesh, because Chander was giving Ramesh a lift from Johor Bahru to his lorry parked in Singapore (see [21] above).
[note: 63]
 It is evident that P96 contains admissions by Chander that affect both himself and Ramesh and that, if found to be capable of being taken into consideration as against Ramesh, would be gravely detrimental, even fatal, to his defence.
46     I reject the Prosecution’s attempt to use P96 against Ramesh pursuant to s 258(5) of the CPC, and find its submissions in this regard to be misconceived in law. Section 258(5) states thus:
(5)    When more persons than one are being tried jointly for the same offence, and a confession made by one of such persons affecting himself and some other of such persons is proved, the court may take into consideration the confession as against the other person as well as against the person who makes the confession.
 
Explanation
 — “Offence” as used in this section includes the abetment of or attempt to commit the offence.
 
Illustrations
 
(

)     
A
 and 
B
 are jointly tried for the murder of C. It is proved that 
A
 said “
B
 and I murdered 
C
”. The court may consider the effect of this confession as against 
B
.
…
Leaving aside the analysis of whether P96 fulfils the s 258(7) definition of a “confession” in the first place (which will, in any case, be addressed below at [69]–[73]), the Prosecution cannot rely on s 258(5) to submit that P96 should be taken into consideration against Ramesh. P96 is a cautioned statement recorded in respect of the charge against Chander under s 5(1)(
a
) of the MDA for trafficking diamorphine by 
giving the D bundles to Ramesh
. On the other hand, Ramesh faces one charge under s 5(1)(
a
) read with s 5(2) for 
being in possession of the D bundles for the purpose of trafficking
. In my view, although Chander and Ramesh were jointly tried for trafficking the exact same bundles of diamorphine, 
ie
, the D bundles, they were not being tried jointly “for the same offence”.
47     This is evident from a plain and literal reading of the language of s 258(5) of the CPC as well as the accompanying Explanation and Illustrations. First, assuming that there are two co-accused persons, I take the view that the Explanation to s 258(5) suggests that s 258(5) should only apply if: (a) both co-accused persons face the exact same charges for identical crimes, or (b) one of the co-accused persons is charged with (i) abetting the other in the commission of the offence with which the other is charged, or (ii) attempting to commit the exact same offence as the other. None of these scenarios presents itself in the present case. Second, Illustration (
a
) to s 258(5) also shows that Ramesh and Chander cannot be considered to be tried jointly for the same offence. Illustration (
a
) provides that where 
A
 and 
B
 are jointly tried for the murder of 
C
, 
A
’s confession that both 
B
 and he murdered 
C
 can be taken into consideration against 
B
. While 
A
 and 
B
 are being tried jointly for the 
same incident
 in the Illustration (
ie
, the murder of 
C
), Ramesh and Chander were tried jointly for 
different drug trafficking incidents
.
48     This reading of s 258(5) of the CPC also finds support in existing case law. In 
Lee Yuan Kwang and others v Public Prosecutor
 
[1995] 1 SLR(R) 778
 (“
Lee Yuan Kwang
”), there were four appellants who were jointly tried for drug trafficking. The two key parties for our purposes are the third appellant, Choo, and the fourth appellant, Yakoob. Choo faced two charges of trafficking, one of which was for trafficking in 166.3g of diamorphine contained in two packets by delivering the two packets to Yakoob. Yakoob faced one charge of trafficking in 166.3g of diamorphine contained in the exact same two packets by virtue of his possession of those two packets for the purpose of trafficking. Those two packets of diamorphine were the very ones which Choo was accused of having delivered to Yakoob. During investigations, the CNB officers had recorded an oral statement from Choo, which contained a confession from Choo that implicated both himself and Yakoob. The trial judge held that the oral statement from Choo could be used as “independent evidence” to sustain the conviction of Yakoob: see 
Lee Yuan Kwang
 at [52]. When the matter came on appeal before the Court of Appeal, Yong Pung How CJ (delivering the judgment of the court) disagreed. In interpreting s 30 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Rev Ed), which was 
in pari materia
 with the present s 258(5) of the CPC, Yong CJ stated thus (at [53]):
… The trial judge’s comments suggested that he did not see a distinction between those cases which interpret s 30 of the Evidence Act and the present case. The crucial distinction is that s 30 of the Evidence Act covers co-accused who are “being tried jointly for the same offence”. We would therefore agree with counsel that 
the situation at present, as far as Yakoob was concerned, did not fall within the s 30 scenario
. While the judge had ruled that all the offences were “committed in the same transaction” as to come within s 176 of the [Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed)], 
the charges before him (at least in respect of Choo and Yakoob) clearly did not constitute “the same offence”. Rather, Yakoob faced an independent charge which was quite unconnected with the two charges against Choo
. …
[emphasis added]
As is evident from the foregoing discussion, 
Lee Yuan Kwang
 is a decision that features facts that are strikingly similar to those of the present case. Ramesh, like Yakoob in 
Lee Yuan Kwang
, faces “an independent charge which [is] quite unconnected with the … charges against” his co-accused, 
ie
, Chander. In other words, they have been tried for distinct and independent offences such that they cannot be considered to be tried jointly “for the same offence”. It is thus clear that s 258(5) of the CPC may not apply in the present context to assist the Prosecution in the manner that they have sought.
49     Having said that, even without relying on Chander’s evidence in P96, I am still satisfied that the evidence provided by Chander at trial as well as the other corroborative evidence discussed above, is sufficient for the Prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Ramesh was in possession of the D bundles.
(2)   Presumption of possession under s 18(1)(
a
) of the MDA
50     Even if the evidence highlighted by the Prosecution is considered insufficient to positively prove that Ramesh was in possession of the D bundles, I find that the Prosecution is able to invoke the presumption under s 18(1)(
a
) of the MDA that Ramesh was in possession of the D bundles. I also find that Ramesh is unable to rebut this presumption on the balance of probabilities.
51     The Prosecution is clearly able to rely on the s 18(1)(
a
) presumption of possession because there is no dispute that Ramesh had possession of D1. Indeed, Ramesh admits in all his statements that Chander passed D1 to him and that D1 was in his possession (see [15]–[17] above).
52     The central question then is whether Ramesh is able to rebut the presumption of possession on the balance of probabilities. In my judgment, Ramesh is unable to do so. Although Ramesh claims that he did not check D1’s contents because he honestly believed that D1 merely contained office documents, I am not persuaded that Ramesh did not know that D1 contained the D bundles.
53     First, I do not accept Ramesh’s explanation that Chander had told him that D1 contained office documents and had instructed him to help safekeep D1 until they were done with their deliveries at about 1pm for the following two reasons:
(a)     Earlier, I have already explained why I considered Chander’s evidence that he had instructed Ramesh to put the D bundles into D1 to be convincing and reliable (see [38]–[44] above). This naturally directly contradicts Ramesh’s account that he was told that D1 contained office documents.
(b)     Next, putting aside Chander’s account of the events, I also do not think that Ramesh’s account is supported by the evidence. Ramesh stated both in P98
[note: 64]
 and at trial
[note: 65]
 that he had informed the CNB officers, when asked what was inside the second lorry, that he had some company documents and a bag in the second lorry. However, it has earlier been established this is contradicted by the evidence of the CNB officers. In particular, PW45 never asked Ramesh what he had inside the lorry. Rather, he had “asked [Ramesh] if he had anything illegal inside the [second lorry]. Ramesh replied ‘one bag’ in English”.
[note: 66]
 He also “asked Ramesh in English ‘where is the illegal thing?’ and [Ramesh] replied ‘middle’ in English, while using his head to point to the area between the driver and the passenger seat”
[note: 67]
 (see [43] above). PW45’s account is in turn corroborated by the evidence of other CNB officers who had helped to administer the search of the second lorry.
[note: 68]
54     Second, even assuming 
arguendo
 that Chander had indeed told Ramesh that D1 contained office documents, I still find Ramesh’s explanation to be inherently illogical for the following reasons:
(a)     First, I find it difficult to believe that Ramesh would have accepted D1 simply because Chander instructed him to help keep it and return it to him later. If D1 indeed contained office documents, there was no reason for Chander to make this request, given that Chander could very well have just kept D1 with him. Ramesh surely ought to have checked D1’s contents given that this was, on Ramesh’s own account, the first time Chander had asked him to safekeep office documents on his behalf.
[note: 69]
(b)     Next, I also reject Ramesh’s explanation that he refrained from checking D1’s contents because Chander was the “senior driver” while Ramesh was just “new to this job”, and so Ramesh was just following Chander’s instructions.
[note: 70]
 I dismiss this explanation as a mere afterthought as it was only conjured up by Ramesh at trial, and was never recorded in any of his statements.
(c)     Finally, I take the view that it is extremely unlikely for Ramesh to not have checked the contents of D1 just because Chander told him that D1 contained office documents, because Ramesh himself had admitted that D1 “felt heavy” when he was first passed the bag (see [17(b)] above).
[note: 71]
 Given that the D bundles together weighed a total of nearly 1kg, Ramesh surely ought to have known that D1 was too heavy for a bag containing mere office documents.
55     Third, I find it troubling that Ramesh failed to check D1 even though it is plain that he had every opportunity to do so. It is undisputed, on Ramesh’s own account of the facts, that from the moment he received D1 from Chander just before he left the first lorry, till the moment he was arrested, Ramesh was the only one who had both physical control of D1 and access to the second lorry. I thus find it extremely unlikely that Ramesh indeed did not know that D1 contained the D bundles.
56     Finally, I do not think that Ramesh is a credible witness, given his inconsistent or inherently unbelievable evidence provided in the course of the trial. This in turn significantly hampers Ramesh’s ability to rebut the presumption of possession. I highlight the following to illustrate this point:
(a)     First, the evidence shows that Ramesh has been untruthful about the phone calls that he received on his mobile phone on 26 June 2013. Whereas Ramesh claimed both in his statements
[note: 72]
 and at trial
[note: 73]
 that he only received two calls, the evidence shows that he in fact received five calls.
[note: 74]
 Further, although Ramesh claimed that he did not know Roy or Roy’s friend (who was in fact the person contacting him on 26 June 2013), the evidence shows that Roy’s friend was the one who had made the five calls to him on 26 June 2013 between the time when he received D1 from Chander and the time of his arrest, and that these calls lasted for some time.
[note: 75]
 Finally, even Ramesh’s evidence about the content of his two calls was inconsistent. At trial, Ramesh testified that the first caller asked him in Tamil “if the job is completed”, while the second caller told him “I am Cheng Meng” before hanging up.
[note: 76]
 I note that this description is broadly similar to the content of the two calls as described in P98 (see [17(c)] above). However, these accounts vary considerably from that provided in Ramesh’s cautioned statement, in which he stated that the first caller had asked him “where is the bag”, to which Ramesh replied that he did not know, while the second caller asked him in Tamil “work finish?”, to which he replied “what work” (see [16] above).
[note: 77]
(b)     Second, Ramesh strangely insisted during cross-examination by the DPP that he did not witness the search of the second lorry immediately after he was arrested, as he was looking down at the road and not the lorry when it was being searched. This was despite the fact that the court had sought clarification in this regard numerous times, thereby giving Ramesh ample opportunity to correct his testimony.
[note: 78]
 Ramesh’s evidence in this regard is clearly unbelievable, in the light of overwhelming evidence from the CNB officers that Ramesh did observe the search of the second lorry.
[note: 79]
57     For all of the above reasons, I find that Ramesh is unable to rebut, on the balance of probabilities, the presumption invoked by the Prosecution under s 18(1)(
a
) of the MDA that Ramesh was in possession of the D bundles.
Whether Ramesh knew that the D bundles contained diamorphine
58     Given my finding that Ramesh was in possession of the D bundles, the Prosecution is accordingly able to invoke the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2).
59     I find that Ramesh is unable to rebut this presumption on the balance of probabilities. In my view, Ramesh has not adduced any evidence to show that he did not know or could not reasonably be expected to have known the nature of the controlled drugs in the D bundles, 
ie
, that the D bundles contained diamorphine. As the Court of Appeal emphatically observed in 
Obeng Comfort
 ([27] 
supra
) at [39], in order for an accused to rebut the s 18(2) presumption:
It would not suffice for the accused to claim simply that he did not know what he was carrying save that he did not know or think it was drugs. If such a simplistic claim could rebut the presumption in s 18(2), the presumption would be all bark and no bite.
Given the evidence before me, Ramesh’s bare assertion that he thought that D1 contained company documents is woefully insufficient to pry open the jaws of the s 18(2) presumption of knowledge, which I find to remain firmly clenched.
60     Accordingly, I find that the Prosecution has successfully invoked the presumption of knowledge of the nature of the controlled drug under s 18(2) of the MDA, and that Ramesh is unable to rebut this presumption on the balance of probabilities. Ramesh is thus presumed to have known that the D bundles contained diamorphine.
Whether the D bundles were in Ramesh’s possession for the purpose of trafficking
61     Finally, I find that the D bundles were in Ramesh’s possession for the purpose of trafficking. This issue was not contested, given that Ramesh failed to make specific submissions in this regard. Regardless, I agree with the Prosecution’s submission that Ramesh possessed the D bundles for the purpose of trafficking.
62     Chander’s evidence was that Ramesh was supposed to deliver the D bundles to a recipient in Bedok (see [22(b)] above).
[note: 80]
 In any case, Ramesh averred in his own statements that he was supposed to return D1 to Chander either at 1pm or when they had completed their respective deliveries (see [15] and [17(b)] above).
[note: 81]
 Given that “traffic” is defined under s 2 of the MDA to include the acts of giving and delivering, as well as offering to do either, I find that the Prosecution has managed to show that the D bundles were in Ramesh’s possession for the purpose of trafficking.
63     For the reasons stated above, I am thus of the view that the Prosecution has established beyond reasonable doubt all three elements in respect of the single charge against Ramesh.
Chander
64     I turn now to deal with the three charges that Chander faces, which are set out once again as follows:
(a)     one charge under s 5(1)(
a
) read with s 5(2) of the MDA for having in his possession the AB bundles, containing not less than 14.79g of diamorphine, for the purpose of trafficking without any authorisation under the MDA;
(b)     one charge under s 5(1)(
a
) of the MDA for trafficking in not less than 19.27g of diamorphine by delivering the E bundles to Harun without any authorisation under the MDA; and
(c)     one charge under s 5(1)(
a
) of the MDA for trafficking in not less than 29.96g of diamorphine by delivering the D bundles to Ramesh without any authorisation under the MDA.
65     The Prosecution’s case against Chander may be summarised thus:
[note: 82]
(a)     First, the element of trafficking for Chander’s two charges under s 5(1)(
a
) of the MDA is satisfied due to Chander’s own admission in his long statements that he gave the D bundles in D1 to Ramesh and delivered the E bundles in E1 to Harun.
(b)     Second, the element of possession for the purpose of trafficking for Chander’s one charge under s 5(1)(
a
) read with s 5(2) of the MDA is made out due to Chander’s admission in his long statements that he was going to deliver the AB bundles to a recipient he was intending to meet.
(c)     Third, the element of knowledge of the nature of the controlled drug for all three charges is met due to Chander’s own confessions in his cautioned statements that he knew that all of the nine bundles contained diamorphine. Alternatively, the Prosecution also relies on the presumption of knowledge of the nature of the drug under s 18(2) of the MDA to show that Chander should be presumed to have known that all nine bundles contained diamorphine.
66     In response, Chander only contests the element of knowledge of the nature of the drugs in his possession, arguing that he did not know that the nine bundles originally in his possession contained diamorphine. To that end, Chander claims that he believed that the bundles all contained betel nuts, and that he did not have any reason to suspect otherwise.
[note: 83]
67     In the light of the arguments raised by the parties, I shall evaluate Chander’s guilt for all three charges by answering the following two questions:
(a)     First, are Chander’s confessions in P94, P95 and P96 alone sufficient to convict him?
(b)     Second, even if Chander’s confessions in P94, P95 and P96 are disregarded, is there sufficient evidence to convict him?
68     In my judgment, both questions should be answered in the positive. I thus find that the Prosecution has managed to establish Chander’s guilt in respect of all three charges beyond reasonable doubt.
Whether Chander may be convicted solely on the basis of his confessions in P94, P95 and P96
69     In my view, Chander’s three cautioned statements, 
ie
, P94, P95 and P96, satisfy the legal definition of a “confession” under the CPC. I also find that they are admissible and are sufficient to prove Chander’s guilt for all three charges beyond reasonable doubt.
70     A “confession” is defined under s 258(7) of the CPC as “any statement made at any time by [the accused] stating or suggesting the inference that he committed the offence”. In determining whether a statement is a confession, the test enunciated in the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in 
Jayalal Anandagoda v The Queen
 
[1962] 1 WLR 817
 (“
Anandagoda
”) is instructive. Lord Guest, delivering the judgment of the court, held as follows (at 823–824):
The test whether a statement is a confession is an objective one, whether to the mind of a reasonable person reading the statement at the time and in the circumstance in which it was made it can be said to amount to a statement that the accused committed the offence or which suggested the inference that he committed the offence. The statement must be looked at as a whole and it must be considered on its own terms without reference to extrinsic facts. … It is not permissible in judging whether the statement is a confession to look at other facts which may not be known at the time or which may emerge in evidence at the trial. But equally it is irrelevant to consider whether the accused intended to make a confession. If the facts in the statement added together suggest the inference that the accused is guilty of the offence then it is nonetheless a confession even although the accused at the same time protests his innocence. … The appropriate test in deciding whether a particular statement is a confession is whether the words of admission in the context expressly or substantially admit guilt or do they taken together in the context inferentially admit guilt?
This test has been repeatedly endorsed by the Court of Appeal: see 
eg
, 
Nguyen Tuong Van v Public Prosecutor
 
[2005] 1 SLR(R) 103
 at [21]. It bears emphasis that the Court of Appeal has notably also held that “for a statement to amount to a confession, it need not be of a plenary or unqualified nature; it can also be of a non-plenary nature so long as the statement connected the accused in some way with the offence”: 
Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v Public Prosecutor
 
[1998] 3 SLR(R) 619
 at [48], citing 
Tong Chee Kong and another v Public Prosecutor
 
[1998] 1 SLR(R) 591
 at [18].
71     In my view, Chander’s three cautioned statements all qualify as confessions. Looking at P94, P95 and P96 objectively, I find that they indisputably amount to statements that Chander had committed the offences he has been charged with. This is abundantly clear from the fact that Chander begins each cautioned statement with the same explicit recital: “I admit to the charge” (see [21] above). These unqualified statements amounted to express admissions of guilt without requiring any inference on my part. It is also clear to me that the cautioned statements all unequivocally connected Chander to each of the three offences that he has been charged with. This is because all three cautioned statements were only recorded after the charges were explained and interpreted to Chander, who confirmed that he understood the relevant charges and notices of warning administered.
[note: 84]
 In this regard, Chander’s pleas for leniency and mercy and expressions of remorse were surely made in reference to the particulars of the offences set out in the charges served on him by the CNB officers and explained to him by the assigned interpreter, V I Ramanathan (“PW41”).
72     At trial, Chander suggested in his examination-in-chief that he made the confessions given that he “was very scared and very confused [because he] was informed that it was drugs and it’s capital punishment, death penalty for it”.
[note: 85]
 In the first place, I do not accept Chander’s claim that he was indeed very scared and confused when giving his statements. His explanations were flatly contradicted by the testimony of PW41, who testified that Chander in fact looked “very normal” and “very calm” when giving his cautioned statements.
[note: 86]
 In any case, even assuming that Chander indeed felt anxious, I do not think that this detracts from my finding that the cautioned statements unequivocally connect Chander to the drug trafficking charges that he is facing. First, if Chander were indeed anxious about the fact that he was being charged with offences that carry the death penalty, it would have been more logical for Chander to 
deny
 his guilt, rather than confess to the charges immediately. Moreover, it has been noted above that “it is irrelevant to consider whether the accused 
intended
 to make a confession” [emphasis added]: 
Anandagoda
 at 823. Hence, insofar as Chander’s explanations in court suggest that he had accidentally admitted to the charges when his cautioned statements were being recorded, they are of no account.
73     Chander also submits that P96 in particularly should not amount to a confession because PW41 mistranslated his oral statement given in Tamil. According to him, he had used the word “jamma”, which means “thing” in Tamil, and did not use the words “bothai porul”, which mean “drugs” in Tamil.
[note: 87]
 I reject this argument and find this to be a mere disingenuous attempt to retract his confession. I accept PW41’s evidence that Chander could not have used the word “jamma” when giving his statement for P96 because if he had done so, PW41 would then have, in accordance with his job as a translator, mentioned it to the CNB officer conducting the interview and then interpreted it.
[note: 88]
 In my view, given PW41’s experience in performing interpretations for similar CNB interviews,
[note: 89]
 it was unlikely that he had made a mistake in translating “jamma”. It was also equally, if not more, unlikely for PW41 to deliberately misinterpret “jamma” as “drugs”, given that there was clearly no reason for him to do so. In the circumstances, I maintain my view that P96 was indeed a confession. Although Chander subsequently denied knowledge of the drugs, it is settled law that an accused person who retracts during his trial a confession he made earlier on can still be convicted on the basis of the confession as long as the court is satisfied that the confession was made voluntarily and that it is true and reliable: 
Lim Thian Lai v Public Prosecutor
 
[2006] 1 SLR(R) 319
 at [43]; 
Syed Abdul Mutalip bin Syed Sidek and another v Public Prosecutor
 
[2002] 1 SLR(R) 1166
 at [21].
74     Since I have established that P94, P95 and P96 are all confessions within the meaning of s 258(7) of the CPC, they are accordingly all admissible unless the statements appear not to have been voluntarily made pursuant to s 258(3) of the CPC. However, I note that Chander did not, at any point in time during the trial, challenge the voluntariness of any of his statements recorded (see [14] above). There was no suggestion that any of Chander’s statements had been obtained by any inducement, threat or promise from any person in authority, or that such inducement, threat or promise, if made, had operated on Chander’s mind.
75     In the light of my finding that all of Chander’s cautioned statements amount to admissible confessions that should not be excluded for lack of voluntariness, it necessarily follows that there is sufficient basis for me to convict Chander on all three of his drug trafficking charges. Having said that, out of an abundance of caution, I shall proceed to consider whether there is sufficient evidence to make out the individual elements of Chander’s three charges, even without Chander’s confessions in P94, P95 and P96.
Whether Chander’s offences may be proved without his confessions in P94, P95 and P96
76     In my view, even if Chander’s confessions are disregarded, there is still sufficient evidence for the Prosecution to establish Chander’s guilt for all three charges beyond reasonable doubt.
(1)   Acts of trafficking
77     Although Chander does not dispute the fact that he had in his possession the AB bundles with the intention to deliver them to another recipient, or that he had given the D bundles to Ramesh and delivered the E bundles to Harun, I will nevertheless briefly address whether the elements of these charges have been made out by the Prosecution.
78     In respect of the two charges for trafficking under s 5(1)(
a
) of the MDA by giving the D bundles to Ramesh and delivering the E bundles to Harun, I find that Chander admitted in his contemporaneous statements and long statements that he gave the D bundles in D1 to Ramesh and delivered the E bundles in E1 to Harun (see [20], [22(d)] and [22(g)] above). It was thus incontrovertible that Chander had committed the acts of trafficking for these two charges.
79     As for the single charge for being in possession of the AB bundles for the purpose of trafficking under s 5(1)(
a
) read with s 5(2) of the MDA, I find that Chander had admitted in his contemporaneous statements and long statements that the AB bundles were meant to be delivered to a recipient he was supposed to meet before he got arrested (see [20], [22(b)], [22(g)]–[22(h)] above). It was therefore clear that Chander was in possession of the AB bundles for the purpose of trafficking.
(2)   Presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA
80     Regarding the requirement that Chander must have had knowledge of the nature of the controlled drug that he is being charged for trafficking, the key question is whether Chander is able to rebut the presumption of knowledge of the nature of the drug under s 18(2) of the MDA. The Prosecution is able to invoke this presumption by dint of the fact that Chander has been proven to have had the bundles in his possession (see [28] above).
81     Chander argues that he did not know that all the bundles contained diamorphine because he believed that the bundles all contained betel nuts and had no reason to suspect otherwise (“betel nut defence”). In my judgment, Chander is unable to rebut the s 18(2) presumption that he knew that all nine bundles contained diamorphine. I briefly set out three reasons for this finding as follows.
82     First, I do not find the betel nut defence to be a credible account of the events. Chander failed to mention the betel nut defence in his contemporaneous statements recorded shortly after his arrest, as well as in his cautioned statements, which were recorded just after midnight of the day after his arrest. When those statements were being recorded, Chander clearly had ample opportunity to explain what he thought he was transporting on behalf of Roy, but failed to do so. From the fact that Chander only mentioned the betel nut defence for the first time on 29 June 2013 when his first long statement was being recorded, which was some two days after his arrest, I draw the irresistible inference that the betel nut defence is a mere afterthought that should be dismissed.
83     Second, assuming 
arguendo
 that Chander was indeed told by Roy that he was helping to deliver betel nuts, I find that Chander was wilfully blind to the fact that the bundles did not contain betel nuts. Chander claimed to have previously delivered one bundle supposedly containing betel nuts to Harun on behalf of Roy in May 2013. This was not supported by Harun’s evidence, which was that the bundle in May 2013 contained diamorphine, and not betel nuts.
[note: 90]
 During that delivery, Harun had passed Chander an envelope containing money in exchange. Chander then handed the envelope over to Roy at a coffee shop back in Malaysia. Roy then counted the money in the envelope in front of Chander. In return, Roy paid Chander RM250 for the delivery (see [22(a)] above).
[note: 91]
 Harun’s evidence is that he had passed Roy S$2,300 for the delivery of the single bundle in May 2013.
[note: 92]
 Chander said in his long statement that he was “not sure how much the total amount was”.
[note: 93]
 Be that as it may, Chander admitted during cross-examination at trial that he saw Roy counting a lot of money in front of him.
[note: 94]
 In my view, Chander thus would have become suspicious, from the large sums of money involved in the prior delivery, that he was not in fact delivering betel nuts for Roy. The fact that he refused to act upon his suspicions by inquiring into the contents of the bundles that Roy had passed to him for delivery for the present charges shows that he was wilfully blind to the contents of the bundles.
84     Third, I find Chander to be a witness unworthy of credit. This was evident from Chander’s evasiveness when answering questions that could potentially imperil his defence. I cite just one example to illustrate this point. At trial, when Chander was being cross-examined by the DPP on the frequency of his interactions with Harun, Chander adamantly insisted that prior to delivering to Harun the E bundles, he had only spoken to Harun once, which was during his first delivery in May 2013.
[note: 95]
 However, call records adduced by the Prosecution flatly contradicted Chander’s evidence: they showed that Chander had in fact contacted Harun on 19 June 2013 and 25 June 2013.
[note: 96]
 The objective evidence thus showed that Chander lied about not having contacted Harun prior to the delivery that is the subject of the present charges.
85     Therefore, I find that Chander is unable to rebut the s 18(2) presumption that he knew that all nine bundles contained diamorphine. I thus also find that the Prosecution is able to prove the elements of all three charges against Chander beyond reasonable doubt, even without relying on the confessions made in P94, P95 and P96.
Conclusion
86     For all the above reasons, I am satisfied that the Prosecution has proven the elements of all the charges brought against both Ramesh and Chander beyond reasonable doubt. I thus find both Ramesh and Chander guilty of the charges that they respectively face, and convict them accordingly.
87     I shall hear submissions on sentence from the parties on a date to be fixed.

Stay of execution
9 November 2017
 Steven Chong JA:
1       This was an application by Bander Yahya A Alzahrani (“the Applicant”) for a stay of execution on his “conviction and sentence” pending the hearing and final disposal of a separate criminal motion in which he applied for leave under s 397 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) to refer three questions to the Court of Appeal (“the Leave Application”). The Applicant was convicted of three charges under ss 354A(1) and 352 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) and sentenced to a total of 26 months and one week’s imprisonment and four strokes of the cane. His appeal against the conviction and sentence was dismissed. At the time of the filing of the present application, he had already begun serving his imprisonment sentence.
2       The present application raised an interesting issue of law as to whether the court had the power to order a stay of execution of sentence pending the determination of a leave application to bring a criminal reference, in circumstances where an accused person had already commenced serving his sentence. I will address this issue in the course of this judgment.
Background and procedural history 
3       The Applicant was a Saudi Arabian diplomat who was in Singapore on holiday at the time of the offences. The victim was a 20-year-old Guest Relations Officer at the Shangri-La Rasa Sentosa Resort and Spa. The Applicant faced two charges under s 354A(1) of the Penal Code for outrage of modesty while wrongfully restraining the victim, and one charge under s 352 of the same for using criminal force on the victim. The offences took place while the victim was showing the Applicant around a suite at the hotel. The Applicant claimed trial to the charges against him. At the end of the trial, the District Judge (“the DJ”) convicted him of the charges and sentenced him to a total of 26 months and one week’s imprisonment and four strokes of the cane.
4       The Applicant appealed against both his conviction and sentence. This led to Magistrate’s Appeal No 9033 of 2017, which came before me on 21 July 2017. I affirmed the conviction and sentence imposed by the DJ. Subsequently, the Applicant, through his counsel, made three applications to defer the commencement of his sentence:
(a)     At the end of the hearing of the appeal on 21 July 2017, the Applicant’s counsel orally applied for the sentence to be deferred so that the Applicant could attend to his personal affairs. I granted a one-week deferment of sentence and ordered that he commence his sentence on 28 July 2017.
(b)     On 27 July 2017, one day before the Applicant was due to commence his sentence, his counsel wrote in to court requesting for a further deferment of sentence until 11 August 2017 so that the Applicant could see his family and settle some personal affairs. I granted this second application and ordered that he start his sentence on 11 August 2017.
(c)     On 10 August 2017, again one day before the Applicant was supposed to begin his sentence, his counsel submitted a further request for a third deferment of sentence on the basis that he would be filing a criminal motion for leave to refer questions of law to the Court of Appeal. His counsel also requested for the Notes of Evidence of the hearing of the appeal on an expedited basis. I rejected this third application for deferment of sentence and ordered that he begin serving his sentence on 11 August 2017. The Applicant duly began serving his sentence on that day.
5       On 18 August 2017, the Applicant filed the Leave Application seeking leave to refer the following three questions to the Court of Appeal:
 
Question 1
 
How does the Court deal with the question of law of public interest which arises when the solicitor having conduct of the hearing in a criminal case puts to a witness his instructions and later informs the Court that he had erred as those were not his instructions as well as informing the Court that he had erred in his instructions in what he told the Court in a previous Court appearance for application to leave jurisdiction?
 
Question 2
 
Is there a need for expert evidence to assist the Court in determining the state of mind of the Complainant, a point of law of public interest, in an outraging molesting case where the Complainant asserts that she was confused, blank and did not know what she was doing and was on ""auto-pilot"" mode as an explanation of her seemingly normal behaviour after the alleged offences were committed?
 
Question 3
 
Could the Judge as a matter of law of public interest accept the evidence of the Complainant on her state of mind without expert evidence asserting that she was confused, blank and did not know what she was doing and was on ""auto-pilot"" mode?
6       The first question related to two incidents which occurred during the trial below. In the first incident, the Applicant’s counsel had initially put to the victim that the Applicant had given the victim a “friendly hug”, but later informed the DJ that there was no such hug and that he had misconstrued the Applicant’s instructions. The second incident arose during a pre-trial application for the Applicant to leave jurisdiction. His counsel had informed the court that he had to accompany his wife and children to China when they had in fact already left Singapore by the time of the application. His counsel tried to take responsibility by stating that he was not aware of the change in circumstances. However, the DJ rejected his counsel’s attempt to take responsibility for both incidents. The second and third questions related to the victim’s evidence that she was “confused”, “in a blank” and went on an “auto-pilot” mode after the incident. The DJ accepted her evidence without calling for any psychiatric evidence. She found that the victim was forthright and gave a coherent, compelling and credible account of the Applicant’s acts.
7       The Leave Application has been fixed before the Court of Appeal on a date between 5 February 2018 and 13 February 2018.
The parties’ arguments 
8       In the present criminal motion, the Applicant sought a stay on his “conviction and sentence” pending the hearing and final disposal of the Leave Application. As the Applicant had been temporarily certified to be unfit for caning, this application was essentially for a stay of his imprisonment sentence. In the supporting affidavit filed by the Applicant’s new counsel, the main ground for the application was the concern that the Applicant might have to unnecessarily serve a substantial part of his imprisonment sentence in the event the Leave Application ultimately resulted in the conviction and sentence being set aside. In his submissions, he relied on s 383(1) read with s 401(2) of the CPC as well as 
Rajendar Prasad Rai and another v Public Prosecutor and another matter
 
[2017] SGHC 187
 (“
Rajendar
”) to argue that the scope of the court’s power to stay execution pending 
appeal
 under s 383(1) extended to 
criminal reference
 proceedings as well.
9       The Prosecution opposed the criminal motion. It contended that the court 
did not have the jurisdiction
 to stay the Applicant’s sentence in the first place. In this regard, it asserted that s 383 of the CPC was inapplicable because it dealt with the stay of execution on a sentence pending 
appeal
. The Prosecution also submitted that s 401(2) read with s 383 of the CPC was only applicable when the High Court invokes its revisionary powers to correct decisions of the State Courts, which was not the case here. As for the holding in 
Rajendar
, it was confined to orders of the court which had 
not yet been executed
. Instead, the Prosecution contended that the relevant provision was s 318 of the CPC, which empowers the court to direct a sentence of imprisonment to take effect on a date other than that on which it was passed. However, the Prosecution argued that s 318 was also only applicable if the accused person had not commenced serving his sentence. In the present case, the court had already exercised its power under s 318 on 21 July 2017 and 27 July 2017 when it granted the two deferments on the commencement of sentence at the Applicant’s request. In any event, the Prosecution submitted that the Applicant had no reasonable prospect of succeeding in his criminal reference. Among other things, the Prosecution claimed that the Leave Application was an “obvious backdoor appeal disguised as a criminal reference” and was an “unmeritorious” application even on a cursory examination of the questions raised.
My Decision
10     In light of the parties’ arguments, there were two main issues that arose for determination: first, whether the court had the power to order a stay of proceedings pending a leave application to bring a criminal reference, in respect of a conviction for which an applicant had already commenced serving sentence; and second, if so, whether the power should be exercised in the present case.
Did the court have the power to order a stay of execution pending a leave application to bring a criminal reference, if an applicant had already started serving his sentence?
11     While the Applicant referred to a plethora of statutory provisions that purportedly grant the court the power to stay execution pending the determination of the Leave Application, in my view, the only relevant provision was s 383(1) of the CPC, which provides:
 
Stay of execution pending appeal
 
 
383.
—(1) An appeal shall not operate as a stay of execution, but the trial court and the appellate court may stay execution on any judgment, sentence or order pending appeal, on any terms as to security for the payment of money or the performance or non-performance of an act or the suffering of a punishment imposed by the judgment, sentence or order as to the court seem reasonable.
12     Section 383(1) of the CPC makes clear that the appellate court may order a stay of execution of sentence pending appeal. In this regard, the Applicant’s reliance on s 401(2) of the CPC was superfluous: s 401(2) extends to the High Court exercising its 
revisionary
 jurisdiction the power under s 383 of the CPC. But in the present case, the High Court was not exercising its revisionary but its 
appellate
 jurisdiction; as such, s 383(1) directly applied without the need to invoke s 401(2).
13     The next issue was whether s 383(1) extended to an application for a stay of execution pending a 
criminal reference
, rather than an 
appeal
. The answer was clearly in the affirmative in light of the decision of Sundaresh Menon CJ in 
Rajendar
, in which he held (at [14]):
…although s 383 on its terms applies only in the context of a pending 
appeal
 as opposed to a pending 
criminal reference
, in my judgment 
it is just that criminal reference proceedings fall within the ambit of the provision as well, since such proceedings can also result in the order of the court being revised.
 To put it in another way, 
it is within the power of the court to stay the orders that it has made pending a criminal reference pursuant to s 383.
 It would be unjust if there were no mechanism for such orders to be stayed pending the disposal of the reference proceedings.
[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold]
14     I noted that in the present case, the Applicant was only seeking a stay of execution of his sentence pending the final determination of his 
Leave Application
, rather than the conclusion of his 
criminal reference
. In my assessment, given that the court had the power to stay execution of sentence pending the determination of a criminal reference, the court must 
a fortori
 have the power to do the same pending the conclusion of the Leave Application as well. For practical purposes, in the event that the Applicant’s Leave Application is 
allowed
, he may have to return to court to make a 
further
 application for a stay of execution pending the final determination of his criminal reference, unless the Court of Appeal orders his release on bail under s 397(4) of the CPC: see [22] below.
15     The Prosecution argued that 
Rajendar
 did not apply to the present case because the Applicant had already commenced serving his imprisonment sentence on 11 August 2017 (see [4(c)] above). This could be distinguished from the facts of 
Rajendar
 as the order of court in that case had not yet been executed. By contrast, “[b]oth logically and as a matter of law, it [was] no longer possible to stay the execution of the sentence of imprisonment [in the present case]”. To put it another way, the Prosecution’s argument, in essence, was that the power of the court to order a stay of execution of sentence 
ceased
 once the accused has commenced serving his sentence.
16     In my judgment, there was no principled basis for the ostensible difference in the court’s power based on whether the order of court had been executed at the time of an application for stay of execution. This was so for a number of reasons. First, such a distinction was neither evident on the wording of s 383(1) of the CPC, nor in the holdings of 
Rajendar
 itself.
17     Second, to impose this precondition on the court’s power to order a stay of execution would unduly prejudice an accused person who had started serving his sentence before filing an appeal or a criminal reference. This was especially so given that it is not uncommon for a sentence to be ordered to commence immediately upon the court’s decision, or after a very short deferment. However, the court may only issue the full grounds of decision at a later date. Even if full grounds are not issued, the administrative process of extracting the Notes of Evidence of a hearing would take some time. The short time frame within which an accused person must begin serving his sentence should be contrasted to the longer time it usually takes for the full records or decision to be made available to the accused person. Yet, it is generally only upon a perusal of these documents that the accused person and/or his counsel can make a considered decision as to whether to file an appeal or to apply for leave to file a criminal reference. In a not insignificant proportion of cases, by the time such a decision is made, the accused person would have begun serving his sentence. It would be manifestly unjust if, by virtue of the decision of the accused to commence his sentence alone, the court ceased to have the power to order a stay of execution. If that were the case, the accused would have to continue serving his sentence while awaiting his appeal or criminal reference, which may not be heard until many months later; in the meantime, he would have no recourse to apply for a stay of execution of his sentence.
18     Finally, to artificially restrict the court’s power to cases in which the order of court had not been executed was also inconsistent with the 
purpose
 of a stay of execution. In 
Public Prosecutor v Saiful Rizam bin Assim and other appeals
 
[2014] 2 SLR 495
 at [44], Chao Hick Tin JA considered it critical for courts to avoid the “unfortunate situation” in which an offender would have already served his imprisonment term (or a good part of it) before an appeal against sentence was heard. Menon CJ opined in 
Public Prosecutor v Adith s/o Sarvotham
 
[2014] 3 SLR 649
 at [29] that the key concern was the interest of the accused person in retaining his freedom until his appeal against conviction or sentence had been resolved. On the reasoning of 
Rajendar
 at [14], these observations would similarly apply to a stay of execution pending a criminal reference, which might also result in the order of the court being revised. The Prosecution’s position was that once a sentence had started, it was no longer 
possible
 to order a stay of execution of it. I failed to see why this would be the case. The objective of an application for a stay of execution of sentence is to suspend the order of court 
before it is completed
; it is not necessarily only to prevent the order from taking effect before it begins. To use the present case as an illustration, the Applicant has only served about three months of his imprisonment term of 26 months and one week. There is still a substantial period of incarceration left which may be the subject of a stay application. In fact, if the accused had already commenced serving his sentence, the concerns outlined earlier in this paragraph would apply with greater force, because it becomes even more imperative that he should not be made to continue serving any more of his sentence before a further determination which may result in that sentence being revised.
19     When I queried the Prosecution during the hearing on why the court should cease to have the power to order a stay of execution once the accused has begun serving his sentence, the Prosecution pointed out that under s 397(4) of the CPC, it was the 
Court of Appeal
 that had the power to order a stay of execution during the Leave Application. Section 397(4) of the CPC states:
 
Reference to Court of Appeal of criminal matter determined by High Court in exercise of its appellate or revisionary jurisdiction
 
 
397.
 —(4) In granting leave to refer any question of law of public interest under subsection (1), or where the Public Prosecutor refers any question of law of public interest under subsection (2), the Court of Appeal may reframe the question or questions to reflect the relevant issue of law of public interest, and 
may make such orders as the Court of Appeal may see fit for the
 arrest, custody or 
release on bail of any party in the case.
[emphasis added]
According to the Prosecution, the proper procedure was for the accused to seek a stay of execution (
ie
, a release on bail) before the 
Court of Appeal
 at the hearing of the leave application to bring a criminal reference. If he wished to expedite the process in which a stay of execution might be granted, he should write in to court to request that the hearing of the leave application be brought forward. If that avenue had not been exhausted, an application for stay of proceedings should not be brought before the 
High Court
.
20     I was unable to accept this argument. Fundamentally, it still did not provide a principled explanation as to why the court’s power 
ceased
 upon an applicant’s decision to commence serving his sentence. The Prosecution’s argument, taken to its logical conclusion, meant that by virtue of s 397(4), the High Court would not 
at any point
 have the power to order a stay of execution; instead, an accused person could only make such an application before the Court of Appeal during the leave application itself. But this would be inconsistent with the Prosecution’s own position that the High Court 
did
 have the jurisdiction to stay proceedings 
before
 an accused commences serving his sentence.
21     Second, the fact that the Court of Appeal might have the power to order a stay of execution during a leave application (by releasing the applicant on bail) did not invariably oust the same power of the High Court which was evident from the language of s 383(1) itself (see [11] above). The concurrent powers of the High Court and the Court of Appeal in relation to criminal procedure is not uncommon; it is in fact evident in other parts of the CPC. For instance, both the High Court and the Court of Appeal can grant bail to the accused (see for example, ss 97, 298(11) and 397(4) of the CPC). Further, under s 356(1) of the CPC, both the High Court and the Court of Appeal may, in the exercise of its powers under Part XX of the CPC (in relation to appeals, points reserved, revisions and criminal motions), order costs to be paid by or to the parties it thinks fit.
22     In my view, the concurrent powers of the High Court and the Court of Appeal to order a stay of execution of sentence are envisaged to be utilised in different circumstances. When a leave application is pending, an accused person can apply to the High Court for a stay of execution under s 383(1) of the CPC in the meantime. To rely on the administrative process of requesting for his leave application to be brought forward is uncertain and the prospect of success would depend largely on scheduling considerations which are beyond the accused’s control. Subsequently, at the hearing of the leave application, the Court of Appeal can also order that the accused be released on bail under s 397(4) of the CPC, for example, if it decides to grant leave for the accused to bring a criminal reference, and is of the view that the sentence should be stayed until the conclusion of the criminal reference.
23     For these reasons, I was of the view that the court 
did
 have the power under s 383(1) of the CPC to order a stay of execution pending a leave application to bring a criminal reference. This power subsisted even if the accused person, such as the Applicant, had already commenced serving his sentence.
If the court has the power to order a stay of execution, should the court make such an order in the present case? 
24     A court’s decision on whether to exercise its power to order a stay of execution pending a criminal reference must turn on the facts and circumstances of each case. In 
Ong Beng Leong v Public Prosecutor
 
[2005] 2 SLR(R) 247
 (“
Ong Beng Leong
”), the accused filed a criminal motion for a stay of execution of his imprisonment term pending the extraction of the Notes of Evidence and the grounds of decision in order to “consider” making an application to file a criminal reference. Yong Pung How CJ held (at [3]):
… before I could grant the applicant a further stay on his sentence, he had to make a 
good arguable case that there were real questions of law of public interest
 that warranted the Court of Appeal’s intervention. I could not simply accept that he had a substantive case [for the criminal reference] and grant him a stay as a matter of course. 
This would be a recipe for disaster, as every unsuccessful appellant would just need to make a similar application – however unmeritorious – to delay the commencement of his sentence.
[emphasis added]
25     In my judgment, the assessment of whether there is a “good arguable case” that there are real questions of law of public interest should be done on a 
prima facie
 level. Otherwise, the court hearing the stay application would risk impermissibly usurping the function of the Court of Appeal, which is tasked to independently determine the Leave Application. If there is no “good arguable case” on a 
prima facie
 level, the criminal reference is less likely to succeed. The concern that there may be an “unfortunate situation” in which the accused has to unnecessarily serve a substantial part of his sentence may prove to be unfounded where there is no reasonable prospect of his sentence being revised.
26     A question of law must be of “sufficient generality embedded within a proposition” and also “[contain] normative force”: see 
Public Prosecutor v Teo Chu Ha
 
[2014] 4 SLR 600
 at [31]. On any cursory examination, none of the questions that the Applicant sought to refer to the Court of Appeal could pass muster. Question 1 arose out of the precise factual matrix in the present case; it was not a question of law, let alone a question of law 
of public interest
.
27     Questions 2 and 3 both related to whether expert evidence was required to assist the court in determining the state of mind of the victim. In the Applicant’s Reply to the Prosecution’s Submissions, he argued that the victim’s explanation that she was functioning on “auto-pilot” mode after the offences amounted to a “mental state of automatism”, and the court required the guidance of an expert to assess this issue. This contention was misconceived. The DJ had not made an assessment of the psychiatric condition of the victim. If she had, she would have impermissibly strayed into the realm of expert evidence. But in the present case, she had merely concluded that the victim’s ostensibly normal behaviour after the alleged trauma of the offences did not affect her credibility or her recollection of the events. This finding was well within the province of the DJ’s role. Furthermore, unlike the cases referred to by the Applicant’s counsel (such as 
Bratty v Attorney-General for Northern Ireland
 
[1963] AC 386
), this was not a case where the Applicant himself was alleging automatism 
in his defence
 (for example, he was not arguing that his acts were involuntary). Instead, it was the 
victim
 who testified that she was operating in an “auto-pilot” mode. This was not a term of art; it simply referred to the victim’s ability to function normally notwithstanding the trauma she went through. The Applicant’s counsel had at the trial below sought to discredit the victim’s credibility by asserting that her ostensibly normal behaviour meant that the allegations against the Applicant were contrived and fabricated afterthoughts on her part. The DJ did not accept this argument and preferred the victim’s evidence. This conclusion was a finding of fact and evidence and not a question of law.
28     In summary, the determination of each of the three questions ultimately depended on the facts of each case as well as the court’s assessment of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses. Put simply, each of the questions was necessarily a fact specific inquiry and did not give rise to any question of law. It was clear to me that on a cursory examination of the three questions raised, there was no good arguable case that there were real questions of law of public interest to be referred to the Court of Appeal, and consequently, there was little risk of irreparable prejudice to the Applicant if the stay of execution were not granted. I reiterate that I had only made this determination on a 
prima facie
 level. As I said to the Applicant’s counsel during the hearing, he is at liberty to pursue the Leave Application before the Court of Appeal which will be making a separate assessment of the merits of the Leave Application.
29     Finally, I observed that the procedural history of this case suggested that the Applicant had been trying to delay his sentence for as long as he possibly could. Each of the three applications for a deferment of the start of his sentence was made 
the day before
 he was due to begin serving his sentence. The present application to stay the execution of his sentence pending the Leave Application was his latest attempt to defer the serving of his sentence. This was the precise danger that Yong CJ warned against in 
Ong Beng Leong
.
30     For these reasons, I dismissed the application.",2017-11-09 00:00:00,SG High Court

INTRODUCTION
1       Native to tropical and temperate areas, cannabis goes by various monikers, one of which is 
Ganja
.
[note: 1]
 Cannabis is detrimental to health,
[note: 2]
 and it has been outlawed by the Misuse of Drugs Act.
[note: 3]
 The yoke of drugs ensnares individuals, enslaves families, and enervates society – ravaging lives.
[note: 4]
2       The accused, Mr Adaikalaraj a/l Iruthayam (“
B1
”), claimed trial to two charges of drug importation under s 7 punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA:
a.     One count of importing not less than 402.7 grams of cannabis, and
b.     One count of importing not less than 541.2 grams of cannabis mixture.
3       All things considered, the Prosecution proved its case against B1 beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I convicted B1 on both charges, and sentenced him to a total of 25 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane. Deterrence is the key sentencing consideration when dealing with drug importation.
(See also Menon CJ’s Opening Address, 
Sentencing Conference 2017
 at [30]-[31])
[note: 5]
4       No appeal has to date been lodged. I now set out my reasons.
THE LEGAL ISSUES
5       The legal issues can be crystallised under the following framework:
6       In brief, my answers are ‘Yes’ to Issues 1 to 2, and ‘No’ to Issue 3.
7       We turn next to examining the legal fabric, 
viz.
 the interplay of the MDA provisions.
ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK 
(A)   Were the MDA Presumptions Invoked?
8        
Importation of Drugs
. Section 7 of the MDA provides that:
Except as authorised by this Act, it shall be an offence for a person to 
import
 into or export from Singapore a controlled drug.
9       The elements of an importation charge under s 7 of the MDA are:
(a)     The physical act of bringing the drugs into Singapore, and
(b)     The accused person knew or intended to bring the drugs into Singapore.
[note: 6]
10      
Actus Reus
. ‘Import’ is defined as ‘to bring or caused to be brought into Singapore by land, sea or air’: s 2 of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 1997 Rev Ed).
[note: 7]
11     In 
Public Prosecutor v Adnan bin Kadir
 
[2013] 3 SLR 1052
 at [70], the Court of Appeal clarified that s 7 of the MDA does not require the Prosecution to prove that the importation was for the purposes of trafficking.
[note: 8]
 In the present case, the element of importation in s 7 was satisfied the moment the drugs were brought physically into Singapore.
[note: 9]
(See also 
A Judge for the Ages: Essays in Honour of Justice Chao Hick Tin
 (Academy Publishing, 2017) at 199-201)
[note: 10]
12      
Mens Rea
. The presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA is relevant.
13     We will now examine the statutory presumptions under ss 18 and 21 of the MDA.
[note: 11]
14      
Issue 1: Section 21 of the MDA
. Section 21 of the MDA provides that:
If any controlled drug is found in any vehicle, it shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to be in the 
possession
 of the owner of the vehicle and of the 
person in charge of the vehicle
 for the time being.
15     It is not disputed that the cannabis and cannabis mixture (hereinafter collectively referred to as ‘Cannabis’) were found inside a Malaysian-registered motorcar bearing registration no. WGN 4531 (‘motorcar’) on 24 November 2014. For B1, as he was in charge of the motorcar at the relevant time, this invokes the presumption under s 21 of the MDA.
16     For knowledge as to the nature of the drugs, the Prosecution may choose to prove that B1 had 
actual knowledge
 of the specific nature of the drug.
[note: 12]
 Available to the Prosecution as an ‘indirect way to prove actual knowledge’ is to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that B1 was 
wilfully blind
.
[note: 13]
[note: 14]
 The threshold to establish wilful blindness is a high one – negligence or recklessness will not suffice.
[note: 15]
[note: 16]
17     Alternatively, the Prosecution may rely on the statutory presumption of such knowledge under s 18 of the MDA, which I turn to next.
[note: 17]
[note: 18]
18      
Issue 2: Section 18(2) of the MDA
. Section 18(2) of the MDA provides that:
Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have 
known
 the nature of that drug.
19     Since B1 is presumed to have had the drugs in his possession, I find that the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA has been invoked for him.
[note: 19]
[note: 20]
 In other words, B1 is presumed to have known the nature of the drugs, 
i.e.
 the specific controlled drugs found in his possession (
viz.
 Cannabis): Court of Appeal in 
Nagaenthran a/l K Dharmalingam v Public Prosecutor
 
[2011] 4 SLR 1156
 at [23]-[24].
[note: 21]
[note: 22]
20     Once the presumptions are invoked, the burden shifts to B1 to rebut those presumptions on the balance of probabilities.
[note: 23]
 I turn now to examine whether B1 had successfully rebutted those presumptions.
(B)   Did B1 Rebut the Presumptions?
21      
Issue 3: Rebutting the MDA Presumptions
. In order to rebut the s 18(2) presumption, what an accused has to do is to adduce evidence to establish on a 
balance of probabilities
 that he did not have knowledge of the nature of the controlled drug (in effect, that he did not have the 
mens rea
[note: 24]
 of the offence).
[note: 25]
22     An accused may rebut the s 18(2) presumption by showing, on a balance of probabilities, that he
(a)     Lacked actual knowledge of the nature of the controlled drug (‘Limb 1’), or
(b)     Could not reasonably be expected to have known the nature of the controlled drug (Limb 2).
[note: 26]
[note: 27]
23     An accused will fail to rebut the s 18(2) presumption under Limb 2 on a balance of probabilities, if the court finds that he neglected or refused to take reasonable steps to find out what such contents were, in circumstances where a reasonable person having the suspicions that he had, would have taken steps to find out. 
[note: 28]
[note: 29]
 In other words, he would be ‘
turning a blind eye
’.
[note: 30]
24     As mentioned above, to rebut the s 18(2) presumption, what an accused has to do is to adduce evidence to establish on a balance of probabilities that he had not known the nature of the drugs. This can come in the form of proof that an accused genuinely believed that he was carrying something innocuous or that he was carrying a controlled drug other than the one found on him. Whether the presumption of knowledge has been rebutted is ultimately a fact-centric inquiry and has to be assessed on the specific facts of each case.
[note: 31]
[note: 32]
25     Similarly, he would not be able to rebut the presumption as to knowledge by merely claiming that he did not know the proper name of the drug that he was asked to carry. The law also does not require him to know the scientific or the chemical name of the drug or the effects that the drug could bring about.
[note: 33]
26     Where an accused has stated what he thought he was carrying (‘the purported item’), the court will assess the veracity of his assertion against the objective facts and examine his actions relating to the purported item.
[note: 34]
27     I am mindful of the inherent difficulties of proving a negative, and the burden
[note: 35]
 on the accused faced with this task should not be made so onerous that it becomes virtually impossible to discharge: Court of Appeal in 
Harven a/l Segar v Public Prosecutor
 
[2017] SGCA 16
 at [2].
[note: 36]
28     In the present case, the Cannabis was found on top of the battery in the motorcar’s bonnet.
[note: 37]
 The Cannabis was in clear cling wrap – haphazardly wrapped in newspaper
[note: 38]
 – and placed in a red plastic bag.
[note: 39]
 During the trial, B1 intimated that he lacked actual knowledge and could not reasonably be expected to know that the red plastic bag in the motorcar contained Cannabis.
[note: 40]
 I did not accept B1’s claim for the following reasons.
29     First, it would not suffice for B1 to claim simply that he did not know what he was carrying save that he did not know or think it was drugs: 
Obeng Comfort v Public Prosecutor
 
[2017] SGCA 12
 at [39].
30     Second, B1 testified that even before the officers found the packet in the motorcar’s bonnet, B1 had known about the packet’s location which caused him to feel ‘strange’.
[note: 41]
 This gave me pause as it was B1 who had placed the red plastic bag inside the motorcar’s bonnet and ‘tied the handles of the red plastic bag at the metal rod which was holding on(to) the battery of the car’.
[note: 42]
31     Even if someone else (e.g. Kesavan or Karthik) had asked B1 to conceal that red plastic bag inside the motorcar’s bonnet, B1 should have found this to be highly suspicious and enquire further.
[note: 43]
 This is especially since B1 admitted that he did not trust them,
[note: 44]
 coupled with the fact that B1 had only met them for the first time less than 2 months before being arrested.
[note: 45]
32     Against this backdrop, B1’s alleged failure to check the contents of the red plastic bag was inexplicable. There was nothing to support the passive posture purportedly taken by B1 – all the circumstances pointed against the reposing of trust, and therefore active steps should have been taken by him to check the contents of the red plastic bag. If B1 did not check, despite these circumstances, this militated in favour of rejecting his version.
[note: 46]
33     I did not accept B1’s bare assertions that (i) he had been advised to place the red plastic bag in the motorcar’s bonnet to avoid paying tax,
[note: 47]
 and that (ii) he did not check the contents of the red plastic bag as he was hurrying to collect his salary.
[note: 48]
 B1, in the same breath, had testified that it was ‘only when (he) was transferring (the red plastic bag) from the car to the front bonnet, (he) may--- (he) 
coincidentally saw what was inside
. And when (he) was tying it to the metal rod, (he) 
could see what was inside
.’
[note: 49]
 It would merely have taken a few seconds to examine the contents of something ‘haphazardly wrapped in newspaper’.
[note: 50]
34     Furthermore, B1 specifically bought the motorcar one day before delivering the Cannabis,
[note: 51]
 even though he had previously travelled to Singapore on a motorcycle.
[note: 52]
 B1 explained that his ‘intention was to use the car for delivering drugs to Singapore as (he) did not want to use (his) own family car’.
[note: 53]
 B1 also took the motorcar to a workshop to repair a window, as he ‘did not want to draw the attention of the Customs officers unnecessarily as (he) cleared the Customs’.
[note: 54]
35     At the Woodlands Checkpoint, a tiny hole was made on the red plastic bag and newspaper, revealing a vegetable substance.
[note: 55]
 Upon seeing this, B1 claimed that ‘he doesn’t know’
[note: 56]
 and ‘the car had just come up from the workshop’
[note: 57]
.
[note: 58]
 While SSgt Jagan s/o Ganasekaran
[note: 59]
 observed that B1 was nervous and scared during the incident,
[note: 60]
 B1 looked normal, not panicky, calm and collected to other officers.
[note: 61]
36     That said, at Woodlands Checkpoint, B1 informed SSgt Jagan in Tamil that he was supposed to pass ‘Jama’ to one ‘Suresh’.
[note: 62]
 The literal meaning of the Tamil word ‘Jama’ is ‘thing’, but based on SSgt Jagan’s CNB experience, it also means ‘drugs’ amongst couriers.
[note: 63]
37     In this regard, B1 had indicated to SSgt Jagan that the item seized from the motorcar’s bonnet
[note: 64]
 – 
viz.
 a hole had been made on the red plastic bag and newspaper, revealing a vegetable substance – was ‘Jama’.
[note: 65]
 During a telephone conversation, Mr Suresh s/o Krishnan (“
B2
”) told B1 where to deliver the ‘Jama’.
[note: 66]
 SI Samir bin Haroon recorded the telephone conversations in a contemporaneous document titled ‘Communication Transcript of Accused’:
[note: 67]
 
Date/Time
 
 
Occurrence/ Remarks
 
 
1458hr
 
 
Recipient called using private number. Spoke in Tamil. Asked B1 where he is. B1 replied he is stuck on causeway, and will call upon clearing immigration.
 
 
1519hr
 
 
B1 called ‘Suresh Sg’ @ xxx using his handphone. ‘Suresh Sg’ informed to meet at the vicinity of Punggol CC. 
 
 
1545hr
 
 
‘Suresh Sg’ called. Asked B1 for whereabouts. B1 informed he went to collect salary first @ Woodlands Interchange. 
‘Suresh’ instructed to place the drugs inside a bicycle basket located between the 3
rd
 and 4
th
 floor staircase landing of block 526 Hougang.
 
 
1613hr
 
 
 
‘Suresh Sg’ called and told B1 that he feels uneasy
,
[note: 68]
and told B1 not to come to Hougang, and to wait for his phonecall.
 
 
1658hr
 
 
B1 tried calling ‘Suresh Sg’. No connection, believed that ‘Suresh’ phone is off. 
 
 
…
 
 
…
 
38     During the telephone conversations, at B1’s own request, the vehicle’s engine was switched on and they tuned in to a Tamil-speaking radio station to simulate an environment where B1 was driving.
[note: 69]
 In relation to the telephone records, both Starhub officers
[note: 70]
 testified that there was no service shortage or error during the relevant period.
[note: 71]
39     In sum, the evidence against B1 was as follows:
(a)     At Woodlands Checkpoint, B1 informed SSgt Jagan in Tamil that he was supposed to pass ‘Jama’ to one ‘Suresh’.
[note: 72]
 B1 had indicated that the item seized from the motorcar – 
viz.
 a hole had been made on the red plastic bag and newspaper, revealing a vegetable substance – was ‘Jama’.
[note: 73]
(b)     B1’s telephone conversations with B2, the contents of which were summarised in the contemporaneous document titled ‘Communication Transcript of Accused’.
[note: 74]
(c)     B1’s 5 positive Long Statements, which were admitted after an ancillary hearing. In these Long Statements, B1 admitted that:
a.       Prior to his arrest, B1 knew that he was bringing one block of ‘ganja’ to B2.
[note: 75]
b.       In this regard, B1 had put his ‘hand inside the plastic bag to unfold the newspapers to take a peep inside. (B1) saw brown dried leaves and upon seeing it, (B1) knew it is ‘ganja’.
[note: 76]
40     In my judgment, B1 had actual knowledge of the specific nature of the drugs (
viz.
 Cannabis). In any event, B1 had not rebutted the s 18(2) presumption of knowledge. B1 had also not rebutted the s 21 presumption of possession.
ANCILLARY HEARING
41      
Challenging the Long Statements’ Voluntariness
 
.
 B1 challenged the voluntariness of 5 Long Statements
[note: 77]
 recorded by ASP Xie Junhao.
[note: 78]
 An ancillary hearing was held.
42      
The Law for an Ancillary Hearing
 
.
 Where voluntariness is challenged, the burden is on the Prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the statements were made voluntarily and not on the Defence to prove on a balance of probabilities that the statements were not made voluntarily.
[note: 79]
[note: 80]
43     It is only necessary for the Prosecution to remove a reasonable doubt of the existence of the threat, inducement or promise, and not every lurking shadow of influence or remnants of fear. 
[note: 81]
44     The voluntariness test is applied in a manner which is partly objective and partly subjective – the objective limb is satisfied if there is a threat, inducement or promise, and the subjective limb when the threat, inducement or promise operates on the offender’s mind through hope of escape or fear of punishment connected with the charge.
[note: 82]
45      
Allegations
 
.
 In the present case, the Defence levelled the following allegations against the recorder of B1’s 5 Long Statements (
viz.
 ASP Xie Junhao):
[note: 83]
(a)     Before recording the Long Statements, ASP Xie threatened B1 through the interpreter that he had better come clean as the drugs were more than 1kg of ‘ganja’, which triggered the death penalty.
[note: 84]
(b)     ASP Xie promised B1 through the interpreter, that if B1 cooperated during the statement-recording:
a.       For a capital charge, the authorities would ask for life imprisonment instead of the death penalty.
[note: 85]
b.       In the event that the drugs weighed less than 500 grams, the authorities would ask for a 10-year sentence.
[note: 86]
c.       B1 would be allowed to contact his family by telephone.
[note: 87]
46     After the ancillary hearing, I found that the 5 Long Statements were voluntarily given, and admitted them into evidence. My reasons are as follows.
47     First, the allegations were denied by ASP Xie.
[note: 88]
48     Second, ASP Xie’s evidence was corroborated by an independent party – the interpreter, Madam Malliga Awandha Krishnan.
[note: 89]
 Madam Malliga testified that the allegations did not take place. She explained that the alleged events were very unusual and she would remember them 
if
 they had occurred, particularly since they supposedly occurred on many occasions over several days.
[note: 90]
49     No questions were directed at Madam Malliga regarding B1 being promised that he can contact his family by telephone if he cooperated during the statement-recording:

 rule in 
Browne v Dunn
 (1893) 6 R 67 as analysed in the Court of Appeal cases of 
Harven a/l Segar v Public Prosecutor
 
[2017] SGCA 16
 at [66] and 
Asnah Bte Ab Rahman v Li Jianlin
 
[2016] SGCA 16
 at [115].
[note: 92]
[note: 93]
50     Third, B1 only raised the allegations during trial, two years after his arrest. Tellingly, none of these allegations were found in the Case for the Defence;
[note: 94]
 in fact, defence counsel did not indicate therein that B1 was challenging the Long Statements’ voluntariness.
[note: 95]
 In the premises, the allegations were after-thoughts.
51     B1 claimed that it was SSgt Jagan who had informed him that what B1 had brought into Singapore was drugs (
viz.
 Cannabis), which attracted the death penalty.
[note: 96]
 However, SSgt Jagan disagreed with B1’s claim, and was called as a rebuttal witness.
[note: 97]
52     I accepted the evidence of SSgt Jagan, ASP Xie, and Madam Malliga, which I found to be consistent and credible. There was no one else in the interview room during the recording of the statements.
[note: 98]
53     In sum, I found that B1’s 5 Long Statements were voluntarily given, and admitted them into evidence. I am mindful that a trial judge has a discretion, and indeed a duty, throughout the trial to reconsider his decision to admit statements given by an accused person if further evidence emerges that raises doubt about their admissibility: 
Public Prosecutor v Tan Lye Heng
 
[2017] SGHC 146
 at [2] and [24]-[36].
[note: 99]
54     It is settled law that an accused person can be convicted on his own confessions, even if they were retracted, if the court is satisfied that they were made voluntarily and that they are true, and there is no need for corroborative evidence to support them.
[note: 100]
55     In the present case, B1 was read back his Long Statements by the interpreter and was invited to amend any part of his printed statements before acknowledging that they were correct.
[note: 101]
 In this regard, B1 amended his Long Statement, Exhibit P19, at [7].
[note: 102]
 The exculpatory version of facts given by B1 at the trial did not appear in his Long Statements.
[note: 103]
56     Once the statements are admitted, the next task is to identify the relevant admissions contained in them that support the elements of the charge: 
Public Prosecutor v Tan Lye Heng
 
[2017] SGHC 146
 at [70].
57     B1’s Long Statements contain the word ‘ganja’. ASP Xie testified that he had not asked B1 specific questions on the drug exhibit, and the word ‘ganja’ originated from B1.
[note: 104]
 This explained why inverted commas were placed around the word ‘ganja’, which means Cannabis.
[note: 105]
 ASP Xie stated that B1 had said that he was delivering ‘ganja’, which B1 confirmed to be Exhibit A1A1 as shown in Exhibit P16-42.
[note: 106]
 I accepted ASP Xie’s evidence.
58     I gave full weight
[note: 107]
 to B1’s 5 Long Statements, where B1 admitted to the following:
(a)     He committed the drug offence due to his debts of RM$33,000.
[note: 108]
(b)     Prior to his arrest, B1 knew that he was bringing one block of ‘ganja’ to B2.
[note: 109]
(c)     In this regard, B1 had put his ‘hand inside the plastic bag to unfold the newspapers to take a peep inside. (B1) saw brown dried leaves and upon seeing it, (B1) knew it is ‘ganja’.
[note: 110]
(d)     B1 placed the red plastic bag inside the motorcar’s bonnet and ‘tied the handles of the red plastic bag at the metal rod which was holding on(to) the battery of the car’.
[note: 111]
 B1 drove the motorcar into Singapore’s Woodlands Checkpoint at about 12.40 p.m. on 22 November 2014.
[note: 112]
(e)     B1 had obtained this ‘ganja’ using the S$1000 that B2 had transferred to him beforehand on 22 November 2014.
[note: 113]
 This transfer of S$1000 is borne out by documentary evidence (
viz.
 Exhibits P1 and P2).
(f)     B2 had ordered the ‘ganja’ via B1 through SMSes and telephone calls on 21 November 2014.
[note: 114]
[note: 115]
59     My view is fortified by B1’s Case for the Defence
[note: 116]
 which states as follows:
‘1.     
Adaikalaraj a/l Iruthayam (Adaikalaraj) has knowledge of the substances
 inside the clear plastic wraps wrapped with newspaper inside a red plastic bag tied by the plastic bag handles to the metal rod holding the car battery inside the bonnet but he has no knowledge of the weight of the substance inside the red plastic bag…’ (emphasis added)
60     For completeness, I observed that the contents of B1’s Long Statements are consistent with other documentary evidence such as his travel movement records provided by the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (‘ICA’) (Exhibit P17) and the summary of the tele-communications records (Exhibit B).
[note: 117]
 In this connection, two examples will suffice:
(a)     ICA’s travel movement records
[note: 118]
 show that B1 entered Singapore on 19 November 2014 at 1.09 p.m. This is consistent with B1’s SMS to B2 at 1.25 p.m.: ‘Cal me bro. I at SG. Ur cake wit me …’.
[note: 119]
 This in turn coheres with B1’s Long Statement
[note: 120]
 at [23]: ‘In the afternoon, I then subsequently delivered the block of “ganja” using my Malaysian motorcycle, JDD5193 to “Suresh”’.
(b)     On 19 November 2014 at 2.28 p.m., B1 sent B2 a SMS: ‘Bro I at ur place call me pls’.
[note: 121]
 This is consistent with B1’s Long Statement
[note: 122]
 at [23]: ‘At about 2.30p.m., I then went to Blk 526 Hougang and placed the block of “ganja” at the pipes at the second floor staircase upon “Suresh’s” instructions. After placing, I then call “Suresh” and informed him that I had already placed the block of “ganja” at the pipes at second floor staircase’. This dovetails with the fact that B1 made several phone calls to B2 between 2.29 p.m. and 2.41p.m.,
[note: 123]
 and also accords with B1 departing Singapore on 19 November 2014 at 3.13 p.m. per ICA’s travel movement records.
[note: 124]
61     B1 was the only person who used the SIM cards in his handphone.
[note: 125]
62     All things considered, the Prosecution proved its case against B1 beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I convicted B1 on both charges.
APPROPRIATE SENTENCE 
63      
Prescribed Punishment
 
.
 The prescribed punishment for s 7 punishable under s 33(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act is as follows:
[note: 126]
(a)     Minimum: 20 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane; and
(b)     Maximum: 30 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.
64     The offence’s statutory maximum sentence signals the gravity in which Parliament views such offences. A sentencing judge ought therefore to take this into account when determining precisely where the offender’s conduct falls within the entire range of punishment devised by Parliament.
[note: 127]
(See the parliamentary debates on the amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Act in 2012 [
Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report
 (14 November 2012) Vol 89]).
65      
Sentencing Guidelines
 
.
 The Court of Appeal, in 
Suventher Shanmugam v Public Prosecutor
 
[2017] SGCA 25
 at [29] laid down the sentencing guidelines for the unauthorised import or trafficking of cannabis:
[note: 128]
(a)     330 to 380 grams: 20 to 22 years’ imprisonment
(b)      
381 to 430 grams: 23 to 25 years’ imprisonment
 
(c)     431 to 500 grams: 26 to 29 years’ imprisonment.
66     The indicative starting sentence (
viz.
 based on the quantity of drugs which is an indicator of the potential harm to society)
[note: 129]
 may be adjusted upward or downward to take into account the offenders’ culpability and the presence of aggravating or mitigating factors. It is possible, of course, that such upward or downward adjustments could result in the eventual sentence being outside the range of sentences.
[note: 130]
67     Sentencing is ultimately an exercise in evaluative ethical judgment; there might well be cases which will eventually be assessed to straddle the border between the bands: 
Ng Kean Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor
 
[2017] SGCA 37
 at [48].
68     The analytical framework of (i) harm,
[note: 131]
 (ii) culpability,
[note: 132]
 and (iii) mitigating/ aggravating factors is helpful for sentencing.
[note: 133]
 In this connection, the eclectic mix of cases adopting the framework is testament to this framework’s versatility:
(a)     Aggravated outrage of modesty under s 354(2) of the Penal Code: 
GBR v Public Prosecutor
 
[2017] SGHC 296
.
(b)     Section 28(b) read with s 29(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act: 
Seng Hwee Kwang v Public Prosecutor
.
[note: 134]
(c)     Section 182 of the Penal Code: 
Koh Yong Chiah v Public Prosecutor
 
[2017] 3 SLR 447
.
(d)     Offences under the Workplace Safety and Health Act: 
Public Prosecutor v GS Engineering & Construction Corp
 
[2016] SGHC 276
.
(e)     Drug trafficking under s 5 of the Misuse of Drugs Act: 
Vasentha d/o Joseph v Public Prosecutor
 
[2015] SGHC 197
.
[note: 135]
(f)     Sections 140, 146, and 148 of the Women’s Charter: 
Poh Boon Kiat v Public Prosecutor
 
[2014] SGHC 186
.
[note: 136]
69     This is unsurprising as the two principal parameters which a sentencing court would generally have regard to in evaluating the seriousness of a crime are: (a) the harm caused by the offence, and (b) the offender’s culpability.
[note: 137]
70     In the present case, the weight of the vegetable matter which was analysed and found to be cannabis is not less than 
402.7 grams
 of cannabis.
[note: 138]
 There is also not less than 
541.2 grams
 of cannabis mixture.
[note: 139]
[note: 140]
71      
Prosecution’s Submissions
 
.
 The Prosecution sought the following sentences:
[note: 141]
(a)     [DAC 913136 of 2015] At least 24 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.
(b)     [DAC 913143 of 2015] At least 11 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane.
72     For the 2
nd
 charge,
[note: 142]
 the Prosecution referred to the following sentencing guidelines (conversion scale for cannabis mixture):
 
 
Band
 
 
 
 
Diamorphine
 
 
 
 
Cannabis Mixture
 
 
 
 
Imprisonment
 
 
 
 
Caning

Up to 3 g
 
 
Up to 198 g
 
 
5 – 6 years
 
 
5 – 6 strokes
 
 
2
 
 
3 – 5 g
 
 
198 – 330 g
 
 
6 – 7 years
 
 
6 – 7 strokes

5
 
 
 
 
8 – 9 g
 
 
 
 
528 – 594 g
 
 
 
 
10 – 13 years
 
 
 
 
9 – 10 strokes
 
 
 
6
 
 
9 – 9.99 g
 
 
594 – 659.99 g
 
 
13 – 15 years
 
 
10 – 11 strokes
 
73     The sentencing guidelines for diamorphine are found in 
Vasentha d/o Joseph v Public Prosecutor
 
[2015] SGHC 197
 at [47]. The High Court in 
Loo Pei Xiang Alan v Public Prosecutor
 
[2015] SGHC 217
 at [17] considered the conversion scale or exchange rate for drug trafficking between methamphetamine and diamorphine.
[note: 143]
(See also the Court of Appeal decisions in 
Pham Duyen Quyen v Public Prosecutor
 
[2017] SGCA 39
 at [56], and 
Suventher Shanmugam v Public Prosecutor
 
[2017] SGCA 25
 at [31])
[note: 144]
74     The precedents do not appear to have drawn any distinction between the sentences imposed for importation and trafficking; furthermore, it is clear that the overall tenor of the punishment provisions for ss 5 and 7 of the MDA is similar: 
K Saravanan Kuppusamy v Public Prosecutor
 
[2016] SGHC 166
 at [4].
75     Applying the sentencing guidelines for cannabis mixture to the present case, importing 
541.2 grams
 of cannabis mixture would fall within Band 5 encompassing quantities of 528 to 594 grams of cannabis mixture, which would attract a sentence at the lower end of the range of 10 to 13 years’ imprisonment and 9 to 10 strokes of the cane.
76     In its sentencing submissions, the Prosecution also stated as follows:
[note: 145]
(a)     B1 did not show any remorse.
(b)     The mode of importing the block of “Ganja” was well-thought-out and executed.
(c)     Having claimed trial, B1 did not deserve any sentencing discount given to offenders who plead guilty at the outset.
(d)     The Prosecution “will not be making submissions on whether the sentences are to run concurrently or consecutively”.
[note: 146]
77      
Mitigation
. B1 highlighted his straitened circumstances. He is the sole bread-winner and his unemployed wife faces financial difficulties in supporting their children and his elderly parents.
[note: 147]
 He wanted to be reunited with his family as soon as possible, so that he “can go take care (of his) kids and be a father for them”.
[note: 148]
78     B1 is “extremely sorry for breaking the law in this country”, “realised that (he has) committed the most terrible crime in (his) life”, and sought “leniency, sympathy and forgiveness”.
[note: 149]
 He stated that he is “completely in (the) wrong”.
[note: 150]
 He has been a law-abiding person for the past few years.
[note: 151]
79      
Personal Circumstances
 
.
 B1 contended that being the sole bread-winner, his incarceration would bring hardship to his family.
[note: 152]
80     However, personal circumstances such as financial difficulties and hardship caused to family by incarceration have no mitigating value save in the most exceptional cases.
[note: 153]
 In the present case, I saw no cogent reasons to consider B1’s personal financial and family circumstances as valid mitigating factors.
[note: 154]
81      
No Prior Antecedents
 
.
 I considered the fact that B1 has no prior antecedents.
82      
Claiming Trial
 
.
 Although claiming trial is not an aggravating factor, no discount would be accorded to offenders who elect to claim trial: 
Mohd Shahrin bin Shwi v Public Prosecutor
 
[1996] 3 SLR(R) 174
 at [21] to [22]
.
[note: 155]
[note: 156]
83      
Culpability
 
.
 Based on the non-exhaustive indicia in 
Vasentha d/o Joseph v Public Prosecutor
 
[2015] SGHC 197
 at [51], B1’s culpability tended towards the higher side. B1 took active steps to avoid detection by concealing the Cannabis inside his motorcar’s bonnet.
[note: 157]
 He had specifically bought the motorcar one day before delivering the Cannabis.
[note: 158]
 B1 had taken the motorcar to a workshop to repair a window, as he ‘did not want to draw the attention of the Customs officers unnecessarily as (he) cleared the Customs’.
[note: 159]
84     It cannot be gainsaid that B1’s drug importation was motivated by the financial advantage of profiting from the drug trade. B1 did not perform only a limited function under direction – he had deliberately bypassed Kesavan and sourced for his own drug suppliers (as he wanted larger profits for himself).
85      
Sentence
 
.
 All things considered, the appropriate sentence is as follows:
 
 
DAC NO.
 
 
 
 
SENTENCE FOR B1
 
 
 
 
STATUS
 
 
 
913136 of 2015
 
 
25 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane
 
 
Concurrent
 
 
913143 of 2015
 
 
11 years’ imprisonment and 9 strokes of the cane
 
 
Concurrent
 
 
 
Total:
 25 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane
 
86     Finally, I am mindful of the principle of proportionality in sentencing.
[note: 160]
 The aggregate sentence of caning did not exceed the specified limit of 24 strokes: s 328(6) of the CPC.
[note: 161]
CONCLUSION
Summary
87     A summary of my Grounds of Decision is as follows:
(a)      
Issue 1:
 Yes, the s 21 MDA presumption was invoked (at [14] to [15]).
(b)      
Issue 2:
 Yes, the s 18(2) MDA presumption was invoked (at [18] to [19]).
(c)      
Issue 3:
 No, B1 failed to rebut the presumptions on a balance of probabilities (at [21] to [40]). B1 also had actual knowledge of the specific nature of the drugs (
viz.
 Cannabis).
88      
Ancillary Hearing
: After an ancillary hearing, B1’s Long Statements were admitted into evidence (at [41] to [60]).
89     Taken as a whole, the Prosecution proved its case against B1 beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I convicted B1 on both charges. In the final analysis, an appropriate sentence for B1 is 25 years’ imprisonment – backdated to 24 November 2014 – and 24 strokes of the cane (at [63] to [86]). He is currently serving his sentence.
90     No appeal has to date been lodged.
91     In closing, I am grateful for the hard work of both sides and for the Prosecution’s comprehensive submissions.
[note: 1]
The term ‘Ganja’ was used in B1’s statements. Other monikers include Marijuana, Pot, Grass, Joints, Hashish, and Weed: https://www.cnb.gov.sg/drugs/bannedsubstance/cannabis.aspx.
[note: 2]
After reviewing more than 500 academic papers on medical cannabis, a team led by Dr Jimmy Lee (Institute of Mental Health, Singapore, 2015) concluded that using cannabis is detrimental to health. At the Asia Pacific Forum Against Drugs 2017 (Singapore, 26 October 2017), the Director of Florida’s Drug Policy Institute in the United States of America (Dr Kevin Sabet) told the media that the growing use of cannabis is a ‘slow-motion disaster’ (
The Straits Times
, 27 October 2017 at B4).
[note: 3]
Cannabis is a Class A Controlled Drug and Specified Drug under the First and Fourth Schedules of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed).
[note: 4]
On a broad canvas, there is the heart-rending waste of human, natural, and financial resources that might otherwise be used for productive goals: Second Reading of the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill, 
Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report
 (12 November 2012) Volume 89. See also the Statement by Singapore’s Delegate to the 66th Session of the United Nations General Assembly on Agenda Item 108, on International Drug Control, Third Committee (5 October 2011) at [3] and [4].
[note: 5]
The 4 sentencing considerations – retribution, rehabilitation, deterrence, and prevention – are ‘mutually reinforcing rationales for punishment’ and ‘the ultimate goal of all of these sentencing objectives is the protection of the public through the prevention of crime’.

More than 15 years ago, Professor Michael Hor, in 
Misuse of Drugs and Aberrations in the Criminal Law
, (2001) SAcLJ 54 to 88, opined that the need to support the Legislature in the “war on drugs” had a great potential to clash with traditional criminal justice values of due process and fairness. The riposte was delivered by Professor Jeffrey Pinsler S.C. in 
Evidence and the Litigation Process
 (LexisNexis, 5
th
 Ed, 2015) at [12.056] on page 490: “[T]he legal presumption has been justified on policy grounds. It normally applies in circumstances which would make the normal duty of the prosecution to prove certain facts particularly onerous… The argument is that, in the absence of such presumptions, potential offenders would commit crimes with impunity, confident of avoiding conviction. The legal presumption has also been justified in relation to crimes which have a particularly abhorrent effect on society as a whole. The policy may be illustrated in the context of the 
misuse of drugs
.” Although Professor Pinsler goes on to discuss drug trafficking, his statement applies equally to the drug importation.
[note: 12]
In such a case, the presumption is still operable even though it need not be invoked:

 at [30], and 
Public Prosecutor v Mohsen Bin Na’im
 
[2016] SGHC 150
 at [115(c)].The Court of Appeal stated in 
Obeng Comfort v Public Prosecutor
 
[2017] SGCA 12
 at [41]: ‘a finding of wilful blindness is simply the inference of actual knowledge that is drawn because it is the only rational and therefore irresistible inference on the facts.’See also

[note: 14]
The High Court helpfully explained the analytical distinction between ‘wilful blindness’ and ‘turning a blind eye’ in 
Public Prosecutor v Mohsen Bin Na’im
 
[2016] SGHC 150
 at [118]: ‘(I)t is of critical importance to maintain a clear analytical distinction between the doctrine of 
wilful blindness
 and the expression “
turning a blind eye
” used in 
Dinesh Pillai
, despite their lexical similarities. 
The former is a means of proving actual knowledge
, and the 
latter arises within the inquiry of whether the accused could not reasonably be expected to have known the nature of the controlled drug
. Where the former is proven (beyond reasonable doubt), the Prosecution does not need to rely on the s 18(2) presumption at all. The latter becomes relevant only when the Prosecution relies on the s 18(2) presumption and the accused seeks to rebut that presumption (on the balance of probabilities).’ (emphasis added)See also Benny Tan,

Obeng Comfort v Public Prosecutor
 
[2017] SGCA 12
 at [36]-[37]: ‘The court assesses the accused’s evidence as to his subjective knowledge by comparing it with what an ordinary, reasonable person would have known or done if placed in the same situation that the accused was in. If such an ordinary, reasonable person would surely have known or taken steps to establish the nature of the drug in question, the accused would have to adduce evidence to persuade the court that nevertheless he, for reasons special to himself or to his situation, did not have such knowledge or did not take such steps. It would then be for the court to assess the credibility of the accused’s account on a balance of probabilities.’

How this burden may be discharged is certainly not a matter that can be spelt out in a fixed formula. It is the overall picture that emerges to the court which is decisive as the court is here concerned not with a scientific matter, but with the state of a person’s mind. A factor which is considered to be critical in one case may not be so in another:

offence-specific
 factors in deciding which band the offence in question falls under. Once the sentencing band, which defines the range of sentences which may 
usually
 be imposed for an offence with those features, is identified, the court has to go on to identify precisely where within that range the present offence falls in order to derive an “indicative starting point”. At the second step, the court should have regard to the aggravating and mitigating factors which are 
personal to the offender
 to calibrate the sentence. These are factors which relate to the offender’s particular personal circumstances.

Introduction
1       The appellant, GBR, is a 45-year-old male Singaporean who faced the following charge under s 354(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) for aggravated outrage of modesty of his 13-year-old niece (“the victim”):
You…are charged that you on 10 February 2014, sometime in the afternoon, at [xxx] Singapore, did use criminal force on one [xxx] (DOB: 28 August 2000, 13 years old at the time), 
to wit
, by:
(a)    fondling both of her breasts;
(b)    touching her vagina area; and
(c)    licking her vagina area
intending to outrage the modesty of the said [xxx], and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 354(2) of the Penal Code (2008 Rev Ed).
2       At the end of a trial, the District Judge convicted the appellant of the charge and sentenced him to 21 months’ imprisonment and four strokes of the cane. The appellant appealed against both his conviction and sentence. The Prosecution cross-appealed against the sentence imposed.
3       After hearing the parties, I dismissed the appellant’s appeals against his conviction and sentence. I allowed the Prosecution’s cross-appeal against sentence and increased the appellant’s imprisonment term to 25 months. I ordered that the caning imposed remain at four strokes. I now provide full grounds for my decision.
Undisputed facts
4       While the acts constituting the offence were contested, the events before and after the alleged offence were largely undisputed and have been set out in the District Judge’s Grounds of Decision recorded at 
Public Prosecutor v GBR
 
[2017] SGDC 169
 (“the GD”) at [5]–[10]. I shall outline these facts in brief.
5       The appellant is the victim’s uncle. He is married to the victim’s maternal aunt (
ie
, her mother’s sister).The day before the alleged offence, the victim’s parents were embroiled in a domestic dispute. The appellant and his wife went to the victim’s residence that evening to try to mediate the dispute and did so until the wee hours of the morning. The next day, on 10 February 2014, the victim did not go to school. That afternoon, the appellant brought the victim to his flat on the pretext that it would be more conducive for her to do her schoolwork there. The appellant was alone with the victim as his wife had gone to work. The offence was alleged to have taken place on the sofa in the living room of the appellant’s flat during that period of time.
6       The appellant subsequently left the flat to pick up the victim’s younger brother and brought him back to his flat to join the victim. Upon her brother’s arrival at the flat, the victim requested to go down to the playground.
7       About three days after the offence was allegedly committed, on the evening of 13 February 2014, the appellant brought the victim to a playground near her house and spoke to her alone. On 14 February 2014, the victim lodged a police report in relation to the alleged offence on 10 February 2014.
The parties’ cases below
8       The Prosecution called nine witnesses, including the victim, her mother, her friends, her teacher, a child psychiatrist and police officers. The Prosecution’s case was primarily based on the victim’s testimony as well as the corroborating evidence of the victim’s friends and teacher, whom she had confided in after the alleged offence. According to the victim, she was seated next to the appellant on the sofa in the living room of the latter’s flat at the time of the offence. The appellant asked her whether he could touch her and she said no. She could sense that the appellant was angry and she became afraid. Despite her refusal, the appellant proceeded to insert his hands under her T-shirt and bra and fondled her breasts for what felt like five minutes. He then removed her shorts and panties before touching and licking her vagina for another five minutes. The acts only stopped when the appellant’s mobile phone rang and he went into his bedroom to receive the call.
9       The Prosecution contended that the victim’s evidence was consistent with her act of blocking the appellant’s contact number on her mobile phone immediately after the incident, the appellant’s insistence on speaking to the victim alone on 13 February 2014 (during which, according to the victim, the appellant indicated he would commit similar acts over the coming weekend), as well as a report by Dr Parvathy Pathy (“Dr Pathy”) of the Child Guidance Clinic, which stated that the victim’s reported distress and acts of self-harm after the incident were symptomatic of post-traumatic stress disorder.
10     With regard to sentence, the Prosecution highlighted the various aggravating factors in the present case and sought a sentence of 27 months’ imprisonment and four strokes of the cane. The Prosecution drew comparisons with the case of 
Public Prosecutor v Azhar Bin Mohamed
 
[2015] SGDC 116
 (“
Azhar
”), in which the accused was sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment for each charge of aggravated outrage of modesty under s 354(2) of the Penal Code. The Prosecution argued that the present case was more serious than 
Azhar
 and deserved a sentence that was higher than that imposed in 
Azhar
.
11     The appellant testified in his defence and also called his wife as a defence witness. His case was essentially a bare denial. He emphasised that he treated the victim like his own daughter and could not have committed the offence. He insinuated that the victim had been subject to undesirable influences in her school, and had purported motives for making the false allegations against him. For example, he said that the victim could have been angry that the appellant had sided with the victim’s father during the domestic dispute between her parents. He also pointed out that the victim did not react like a typical victim of a sexual crime during and after the alleged offence.
The District Judge’s decision
12     After setting out the evidence of the Prosecution and defence witnesses, the District Judge noted that the Prosecution’s case rested largely on the testimony of the victim (at [56] of the GD). He proceeded to assess the veracity, reliability and credibility of the victim’s evidence (at [65] of the GD). He concluded that the victim appeared to be a “mature, sensible and reasonable girl” who was able to provide a coherent account of events. She was largely consistent in her accusations and allegations against the accused (at [66] of the GD). The District Judge added that he had observed the victim’s demeanour when she gave evidence and found her to be “entirely truthful” (at [79] of the GD) and her evidence to be “absolutely and unusually convincing and compelling”. He stated that the victim had “testified to the best of her memory and in an internally consistent manner” and her evidence of the events and alleged acts of molest was “both internally consistent and externally consistent with her immediate behaviour and response and the conduct of the [appellant] in the days following the offence” (at [80] of the GD).
13     In particular, the District Judge noted that there was no “list of checkboxes” of expected or known behaviour that the victim was supposed to exhibit after the alleged offence (at [68] of the GD). In the present case, the victim was an “innocent and sexually inexperienced 13 year old student” who was completely unprepared and in a state of shock when the offence occurred; she did not stop the appellant as she was afraid of him (at [69] and [70] of the GD). The District Judge also found that the victim’s complaint was corroborated by her subsequent conduct of telling her friends, her teacher, her parents and the police, the blocking of the appellant’s number on her mobile phone, the appellant taking the victim out and speaking to her alone, and the victim’s distress and acts of self-harm (at [82] of the GD). The evidence of the other Prosecution witnesses was also substantially consistent (at [83] of the GD). The District Judge observed that the victim had no motive to lie and “stood to gain nothing but in fact lost much” in making the allegations against the appellant (at [103] of the GD).
14     On the other hand, the District Judge did not believe the appellant’s defence (at [91] of the GD). He noted that the appellant had failed to put various material aspects of his defence to the victim, thus demonstrating that they were “unmeritorious afterthoughts” (at [92]–[93] of the GD). Further, the appellant’s credit was impeached by the Prosecution in respect of some material aspects of his evidence (at [94] of the GD).
15     With regard to sentence, the District Judge took into account the aggravating factors of (a) an abuse of position of trust by the appellant; (b) the appellant’s intrusion of the victim’s private parts; (c) the sustained duration of the offence; (d) the presence of premeditation; (e) the appellant intimating to the victim that he would perform further acts of molest in the subsequent days; and (f) the adverse psychological effects on the victim. He noted that the appellant did not plead guilty and would not have been entitled to any sentencing discount (at [112]–[114] of the GD). There were no real mitigating factors in the present case (at [122] of the GD). However, the District Judge did not agree with the Prosecution’s submission that the facts of the present case were more aggravated than that in 
Azhar
. In the latter case, the victim was much younger and was subjected to more counts of molest. The accused had also caused hurt to the victim. Thus, he disagreed that the sentence for the present case must be 
significantly
 higher than the 18 months’ imprisonment given in 
Azhar
 (at [118] of the GD). He duly imposed a sentence of 21 months’ imprisonment and four strokes of the cane on the appellant.
The arguments on appeal
16     The appellant’s main contention on his appeal against conviction was that the victim’s evidence was not “unusually convincing”. He reiterated that her behaviour during and after the offence was atypical of a victim of sexual assault. For example, she did not scream, shout or cry during the alleged sexual acts, and did not call for help immediately following the incident. He pointed out material inconsistencies in relation to some aspects of the victim’s evidence and maintained that she had a motive to lie. With regard to sentence, he contended that it was manifestly excessive for a single charge. Should the conviction be upheld, he sought a reduced sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment and two strokes of the cane.
17     In the Prosecution’s cross-appeal against sentence, it argued that the District Judge erred in:
(a)     Failing to give sufficient weight to the sentencing principles of retribution and deterrence. These principles were particularly relevant given that the appellant was a trusted family member of the victim, the age of the victim, the extremely intrusive and degrading nature of the acts, and the conduct of the appellant in claiming trial and disparaging the victim in the course of his defence;
(b)     Failing to give due weight to the aggravating factors in the present case;
(c)     Failing to apply his mind to the full sentencing spectrum available to him. In this regard, the sentence imposed was only 35% of the five years’ statutory maximum imprisonment that could be imposed; and
(d)     Failing to adequately consider the applicable sentencing precedents.
The Prosecution maintained on appeal, as it did below, that the appropriate sentence should be at least 27 months’ imprisonment and four strokes of the cane.
My decision on the appeal against conviction
18     The appellant’s appeal against his conviction turned solely on the District Judge’s findings of fact and assessments of the victim’s credibility. It is well-established that an appellate court should be slow to overturn a trial judge’s findings of fact unless they are “plainly wrong” or reached “against the weight of the evidence”. This principle is especially pertinent where the findings hinge on the trial judge’s assessment of the credibility and veracity of the witnesses. The rationale for this is that an appellate court has neither seen nor heard the witnesses; it is thus in a less advantageous position as compared to the trial judge who has had the benefit of hearing the evidence of the witnesses in full and observing their demeanour. The upshot is that factual findings are 
prima facie
 correct and will not be lightly disturbed in the absence of good reasons: see 
Yap Giau Beng Terence v Public Prosecutor
 
[1998] 2 SLR(R) 855
 at [24].
19     In the present case, I saw no reason to disturb the findings of fact by the District Judge; in particular there was no basis for me to overturn his findings on the demeanour and credibility of the victim, whose evidence the Prosecution chiefly relied on. The findings were not clearly wrong, nor were they against the weight of the evidence. I further agreed with the District Judge’s finding that the victim’s evidence was internally consistent and externally corroborated by the testimony of the other Prosecution witnesses.
20     I should add that I saw absolutely no merit in the appellant’s insinuation that the victim must have been making false allegations against him because her behaviour at and around the time of the alleged offence was atypical of a victim of a sexual crime. I shared the District Judge’s view (at [68] of the GD) that victims of sexual crimes cannot be straitjacketed in the expectation that they must act or react in a certain manner. The fact that the victim was young, sexually inexperienced and was thus likely to have been taken aback by the appellant’s unexpected but brazen conduct meant that her reaction was well within the realm of possibilities and indeed would have been perfectly foreseeable.
21     Finally, I also agreed with the District Judge that the victim simply had no motive to lie. The appellant did not adduce any evidence in support of any of the alleged “motives” ascribed to her – in fact, as the District Judge observed, many of these allegations were not even put to the victim; the accusations were thus rightly characterised as “vague and unsubstantiated” and “nothing but afterthoughts” (at [91] of the GD).
My decision on the appeals against sentence
22     I turn to the appeals by both the appellant and the Prosecution against the sentence imposed by the District Judge. It will be recalled that the District Judge imposed a sentence of 21 months’ imprisonment and four strokes of the cane on the appellant. The appellant argued that this was manifestly excessive, while the Prosecution took the opposite position that it was manifestly inadequate and unduly lenient.
The legal principles 
23     Section 354 of the Penal Code provides:
 
Assault or use of criminal force to a person with intent to outrage modesty
 
354.—(1) Whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any person, intending to outrage or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby outrage the modesty of that person, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with caning, or with any combination of such punishments.
(2)    Whoever commits an offence under subsection (1) 
against any person under 14 years of age
 shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 
5 years
, or with fine, or with caning, or with any combination of such punishments.
[emphasis added]
24     Section 354(2) was added to the Penal Code by s 63 of the Penal Code (Amendment) Act 2007 (No 51 of 2007). According to the Explanatory Statement to the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill 2007 (Bill 38 of 2007), s 354(2) is intended to provide an enhanced penalty where outrage of modesty is committed against a child under 14 years of age. The statutorily prescribed maximum sentence that can be imposed is increased two and a half times, from two years to five years. In addition, such offences, unlike outrage of modesty 
simpliciter
 under s 354(1) of the Penal Code, are non-compoundable.
25     The sentencing benchmark in relation to outrage of modesty under the non-aggravated s 354(1) of the Penal Code, where a victim’s private parts or sexual organs are intruded upon, is nine months’ imprisonment and caning: 
Public Prosecutor v Chow Yee Sze
 
[2011] 1 SLR 481
 at [9]. In my view, a significant uplift is necessary for offences against minors under the aggravated s 354(2) of the Penal Code: see 
Public Prosecutor v BLV
 
[2017] SGHC 154
 (“
BLV
”) at [140].
A proposed sentencing framework 
26     In my judgment, it would be helpful to take a leaf from 
Ng Kean Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor
 
[2017] SGCA 37
 (“
Terence Ng
”) and set out a sentencing framework in relation to offences under s 354(2) of the Penal Code. This would be useful for two reasons. First, it would go towards achieving some measure of consistency of punishment among the different cases brought under the section. Second, it would ensure that the full sentencing spectrum, up to the statutory maximum penalty, is utilised so that the appropriate sentence can be calibrated somewhere along that spectrum.
Offence-specific factors 
27     In line with 
Terence Ng
 at [39(a)], the court should first consider the offence-specific factors, which I enumerate below. The factors are of course non-exhaustive and only represent a digest of those that were examined in precedent cases. There are in my view three main categories of factors: the first two broadly relate to the 
culpability
 of the offender, and the third to the 
harm
 caused to the victim. Many of them overlap with the offence-specific aggravating factors listed in 
Terence Ng
.
28     The first category of factors relates to the 
degree of sexual exploitation
. These include the part of the victim’s body the accused touched, how the accused touched the victim, and the duration of the outrage of modesty (see 
Public Prosecutor v Heng Swee Weng
 
[2010] 1 SLR 954
 (“
Heng Swee Weng
”) at [22]). The offence is more aggravated if the victim’s private parts are touched, there is skin-to-skin contact (as opposed to touching over the clothes of the victim), and the sexual exploitation continued for a sustained period rather than a fleeting moment.
29     The court should next consider the 
circumstances of the offence
. These include, but are not limited to:
(a)      
The presence of premeditation
: see 
Heng Swee Weng
 at [22(d)];
(b)      
The use of force or violence
: see 
Azhar
 at [17] (see also [36(a)] below);
(c)      
The abuse of a position of trust
: as noted in 
Terence Ng
 at [44(b)], this primarily concerns two types of cases. The first is where the accused is in a position of responsibility towards the victim, 
eg
, parents and step-parents and their children (
Azhar
; 
GBJ v Public Prosecutor
 
[2017] SGDC 6
 (“
GBJ
”) and 
Public Prosecutor v ABO
 
[2016] SGDC 80
 (“
ABO
”)), medical practitioners and patients, and teachers and their pupils (
Public Prosecutor v Lewis Ian
 District Arrest Case No 916213 of 2016 and another (“
Lewis Ian
”)). The second is where the accused is a person in whom the victim has placed her trust by virtue of his office of employment, 
eg
, a bus driver and a school child (
Public Prosecutor v Chan Boon Wee
 
[2011] SGDC 199
 (“
Chan Boon Wee
”)). Deterrence is a particular concern where there is an abuse of trust in an inter-familial context, given the difficulty in the detection of the offences and the considerable barriers faced by the victim in reporting them: see 
Public Prosecutor v NF
 
[2006] 4 SLR(R) 849
 at [40];
(d)      
The use of deception
: in 
Public Prosecutor v Al-Habib Sheih Haji Ismail Al Mahberoh
 
[2010] SGDC 400
 (“
Al-Habib
”), the accused entered the victim’s house under the pretence of giving a massage to the victim’s mother, who believed that the accused had special healing powers. The accused then brought the victim to the kitchen toilet under a guise of removing “ghosts” from her body. There, the accused touched the victim’s breasts and twisted her nipples for five minutes. In 
Public Prosecutor v GAO
 
[2015] SGDC 3
 (“
GAO
”), the accused, who was a massage therapist, suggested to the victim that he perform a body massage on her to improve her blood circulation. In the course of the massage, the accused fondled and stroked the victim’s breasts, caressed her buttock and touched her vagina;
(e)      
Other aggravating acts accompanying the outrage of modesty
: for example, in 
GBJ
, the accused showed the victim a pornographic film before he outraged her modesty. Another illustration would be the use of sedating drugs to render the victim unconscious before the sexual exploitation;
(f)      
The exploitation of a vulnerable victim
: I note that s 354(2) is itself a provision that deals with outrage of modesty of a child below the age of 14. However, as pointed out by Aedit Abdullah JC (as he then was) in 
BLV
 at [132], although the enhanced framework represents a general position that offences against minors should be dealt with more severely than those against non-minors, the framework did not intend to treat 
all
 offences committed against minors equally. The aggravating factor of young age would, in relation to enhanced offences, apply if the victim concerned was materially younger than the stipulated age ceiling, and in a graduated manner depending on how much younger the victim was. I agree with this approach: if the offence were, for example, perpetrated against a toddler, this would be more aggravated than that against an older child for the reason that the toddler would be defenceless and unable to extricate himself or herself from the situation. I would add that if the victim presents further vulnerabilities, such as if he or she were suffering from any mental or physical infirmities, this would further aggravate the offence. Concerns of general deterrence weigh heavily in favour of the imposition of a more severe sentence to deter would-be offenders from preying on such victims: see 
Terence Ng
 at [44(e)].
30     Finally, the court should have regard to the 
harm caused to the victim
, whether physical or psychological. This would usually be set out in a victim impact statement.
The sentencing bands
31     Once the gravity of the offence has been ascertained based on the above non-exhaustive factors, the court should place the offence within an appropriate band of imprisonment. In 
Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v Public Prosecutor
 
[2006] 4 SLR(R) 653
 at [84], the Court of Appeal held that where Parliament sets a statutory maximum, it signals the gravity with which the public, through Parliament, views that particular offence. Sentencing judges must therefore take note of the maximum penalty and then apply their minds to determine precisely where the offender’s conduct falls along the spectrum of punishment devised by Parliament. In other words, the court must carefully explore the 
full spectrum
 of sentences in determining the appropriate sentence. Taking this into account, in my judgment, the sentencing bands should span the entire continuum up to the statutory maximum punishment of five years’ imprisonment, as follows:
(a)     Band 1: less than one year’s imprisonment;
(b)     Band 2: one to three years’ imprisonment; and
(c)     Band 3: three to five years’ imprisonment.
Caning should also be imposed if the facts and circumstances of the case warrant this as an additional deterrent. Adopting the principle in 
Chow Yee Sze
 at [9], the starting point is that caning will be imposed where a victim’s private parts or sexual organs are intruded upon.
32     Band 1 comprises cases at the lowest end of the spectrum of seriousness. These would include those which do not present any (or at most one) of the aggravating factors, for example, those that involve a fleeting touch or a touch over the clothes of the victim, and do not involve the intrusion into the victim’s private parts. Caning is 
generally
 not imposed for this category of cases, although the possibility of caning is not excluded altogether; this depends on the precise facts and circumstances of each case. In 
Public Prosecutor v NYH
 
[2014] SGDC 432
 (“
NYH
”) at [39], the district judge surveyed the precedents and held that a custodial term would be imposed even where the victim’s private parts were not intruded upon and there was no abuse of authority. Two examples of Band 1 cases are as follows. In 
Public Prosecutor v Palanisami Mohankumar
 District Arrest Case No 501215 of 2013 and others (cited in 
NYH
 at [39(i)]), a sentence of four months’ imprisonment was imposed on the accused who had put his hand through a window and rested it on the thigh of an 11-year-old female victim. A similar charge was taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. In 
Public Prosecutor v Gee Ah Meng
 District Arrest Case No 55192 of 2010 and others (cited in 
NYH
 at [39(ii)]) (“
Gee Ah Meng
”), a ten-week imprisonment term was imposed on the accused, a stranger to the victim who was a ten-year-old male student. The accused had suddenly approached the victim and touched and caressed his chest for approximately half a minute.
33     Where two or more of the aggravating factors present themselves, the case will almost invariably fall within Band 2. Caning will nearly always be imposed, and the suggested starting point would be at least three strokes of the cane. All the cases cited by the Prosecution in the present case came within this band. At the lower end of the band would be cases in which there was an absence of skin-to-skin contact with the private parts of the victim, for example, if the touching occurred over the victim’s clothes. In 
GBJ
, the accused rubbed the left breast of the victim over her clothes and kissed her eyebrow. He also pulled her shoulder so that she lay down with her head on his stomach. The accused then unfastened the Velcro fastener on his shorts, but the victim left the room before he could do anything further. He was sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane. In the first and second charges under s 354(2) of the Penal Code in 
ABO
, the accused touched the victim’s vagina and buttocks over her shorts, and rubbed his penis over her shorts at her vagina area. On appeal, 18 months’ imprisonment was imposed in relation to the first charge and 21 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane meted out for the second charge: 
Public Prosecutor v BAT
 Magistrate’s Appeal No 9047 of 2016/01 (2 September 2016). In both these cases, there were other aggravating factors such as the abuse of a position of trust (the offenders and the victims were stepfather and stepdaughter) and the touching of a private part of the victim. In 
GBJ
, there was an additional aggravating factor in that the accused showed the victim a pornographic film before the outrage of modesty began, even though the nature of the sexual exploitation may not have been as intrusive as that in 
ABO
. These would have taken the cases outside the scope of Band 1.
34     At the higher end of the spectrum of Band 2 cases would be those involving the skin-to-skin touching of the victim’s private parts or sexual organs. In the third charge in 
ABO
, for example, the accused rubbed his exposed and erect penis against the victim’s vagina. He was sentenced (upon appeal by the Prosecution) to two years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane. The sentence imposed was higher than that for the first and second charges, as described above.
35     The use of deception by the accused is also a relevant aggravating factor which would bring a case to the higher end of the spectrum of Band 2 cases. I have already highlighted the facts of 
GAO
 and 
Al-Habib
 at [29(d)] above, which were cases cited by the Prosecution. In each case, the accused was sentenced to 24 months’ imprisonment. Another case involving deception is 
Public Prosecutor v Ng Ban Keong
 District Arrest Case No 26192 of 2010 and others (cited in 
Public Prosecutor v GBE
 
[2016] SGDC 223
 (“
GBE
”) at [11]). In that case, the accused was charged with various sexual offences committed against young girls aged between nine and 12. The accused pretended to be a doctor and offered to perform medical check-ups on them under this guise. He even supported his ruse by carrying a thermometer, surgical gloves, and a stethoscope. In respect of a charge against an 11-year-old victim under s 354(2) of the Penal Code, the accused noticed the victim on the bus and followed her. He then told her that he was asked by her school principal to do a check-up for her and brought her to the car park staircase of a nearby shopping centre. There, he touched the victim’s stomach under her dress, pulled down her shorts and panties, and used his thumb and index finger to rub her vagina in a circular motion for about ten to 15 seconds. He was sentenced to two years and six months’ imprisonment in respect of this charge. It should be noted that the accused persons in these cases were spared from caning because they were above 50 years of age at the time of sentencing.
36     Two cases appear to be somewhat anomalous with the general trend I observed above:
(a)     In 
Azhar
, which was cited by the Prosecution below and considered by the District Judge, the 51-year-old accused faced two charges for outraging the modesty of his eight or nine-year-old stepdaughter. A similar charge was taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. In respect of one of the charges, the accused was alone with the victim at home. He told her to take off her shirt but she refused. He proceeded to cane her until she cried. He then forcefully removed her shirt, pushed her onto the floor, removed her shorts and panties and rubbed her nipples and vagina area. He also licked her nipples. On the other occasion, he pulled her towards him, forcefully removed her panties, and pushed her to the floor before licking her vagina. I did not consider that the District Judge had erred in finding that the facts of 
Azhar
 were more aggravated than the present case. In my view, the sentence in 
Azhar
 may well have been unduly lenient, given the clear aggravating factors such as the victim’s tender age, the abuse of the position of trust, and the violence and criminal force used. These were in fact acknowledged by the trial judge himself in his grounds of decision in 
Azhar
 (at [8]–[11]). I observe that the trial judge was perhaps influenced by the Prosecution’s submissions, which only sought 18 months’ imprisonment. But in my view, on the framework I have proposed, 
Azhar
 should have fallen within the highest end of Band 2 at the minimum, or even within Band 3.
(b)     The second case is that of 
Chan Boon Wee
. In that case, the accused, who was a school bus driver, slipped his fingers under the victim’s leotard and panties before touching her vagina on two occasions. Although there was skin-to-skin touching of the victim’s private part, he was only sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment and four strokes of the cane on each charge. While this was not expressly stated by the trial judge, one possible reason for this anomaly may be that the sentences for the two charges were ordered to run 
consecutively
, leading to a global sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane. As reiterated in 
Pram Nair v Public Prosecutor
 
[2017] SGCA 56
 at [171], a court may consider it necessary to calibrate the individual sentences downwards to ensure that the 
aggregate
 sentence is not excessive; the trial judge could have considered it necessary to do so in 
Chan Boon Wee
.
37     Band 3 cases are those which, by reason of the number of the aggravating factors, present themselves as the most serious instances of aggravated outrage of modesty. Caning ought to be imposed, and the suggested starting point would be at least six strokes of the cane. These would include cases such as those involving the exploitation of a particularly vulnerable victim, a serious abuse of a position of trust, and/or the use of violence or force on the victim. Two examples of existing cases which may conceivably fall within Band 3 are as follows:
(a)     In 
BLV
, the accused was the biological father of the victim. At the time of the offences, the victim was between 11 and 13 years old. The accused faced (among others) three charges of aggravated outrage of modesty under s 354(2) of the Penal Code. The accused had (a) rubbed his penis against the victim’s face while she was on the floor – some degree of coercion was present and the accused’s conduct caused the victim fear; (b) touched and rubbed the area outside the victim’s vagina and attempted to digitally penetrate it and (c) forcefully pulled the victim onto the bed despite her refusal. Despite the victim turning her body away, the accused persisted with some degree of force. He then rubbed his penis against her vagina and anus. All of these took place within the family residence. The accused was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane for the first two of these charges, and three years and six months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane for the third charge. I note that at the time of this decision, there is a pending appeal by the accused against his conviction and sentence.
(b)     In District Arrest Case No 31193 of 2011 and others (name redacted) (cited in 
GBE
 at [11]), the accused was the biological father of the two victims, who were 13 and 11 years old at the time of the offence. In respect of the charge involving his younger daughter, the accused asked her to masturbate him. Thereafter, he made her lie down on the bed and open her legs. He then attempted to penetrate her vagina with his penis. While doing so, the victim shouted in pain. The accused then turned the victim around such that she was in a “baby crawl” position and rubbed his penis against her buttocks near her anus. He was sentenced to three years and three months’ imprisonment and nine strokes of the cane. No appeal was lodged against this decision.
In my judgment, the same aggravating factors existed in both cases: the high degree of abuse of position and trust in a familial context (the accused and the victim being 
biological
 father and child), the intrusive nature of the acts (including attempted penile and digital penetration) and the force used and fear or distress caused to the victim.
38     I should add that these precedent cases are set out for illustrative purposes only. Ultimately, it is the particular factual circumstances of each case that should be thoroughly considered in determining the appropriate sentence.
General aggravating and mitigating factors
39     Finally, the sentence that is ultimately imposed must take into account aggravating and mitigating factors which relate to the offender 
generally
, but which are not offence-specific. Aggravating factors include the number of charges taken into consideration, the lack of remorse, and relevant antecedents demonstrating recalcitrance (
Heng Swee Weng
 at [22(f)]). Mitigating factors include a timeous plea of guilt (which tends to show contrition, which would save the victim the trauma of having to testify in court, and which saves the resources of the state: see 
Terence Ng
 at [69]), or the presence of a mental disorder or intellectual disability on the part of the accused (
Heng Swee Weng
 at [22(g)]). In relation to the last factor, the presence of a mental disorder or intellectual disability must relate to the offence, for example, there must be proof of a reduced ability to understand the nature of the act. General allegations of mental illnesses such as depression that are unrelated to the commission of the offences would not take the accused very far (see 
Chan Boon Wee
 at [65]).
Other considerations
40     Finally, if the accused is certified to be unfit for caning, for example, because he is above 50 years of age at the time of caning (s 325(1)(
b
) of the CPC), or is certified to be medically unfit for caning (s 331 of the CPC), ss 325(2) and 332(2)(
b
) of the CPC empower the court to enhance his imprisonment term by up to a maximum of 12 months. Following the High Court’s decision in 
Amin bin Abdullah v Public Prosecutor
 
[2017] SGHC 215
 (“
Amin bin Abdullah
”) at [53] and [58], it is clear that the term of imprisonment should not be enhanced unless there are grounds to do so. The court should thus consider whether there are grounds to enhance the sentence by way of the imposition of imprisonment in lieu of caning. In an offence such as outrage of modesty, an imprisonment term in lieu of caning may be appropriate where there is the need for a sufficiently deterrent and retributive sentence (see 
Public Prosecutor v Tan Kok Leong and another appeal
 
[2017] SGHC 188
 (“
Tan Kok Leong
”) at [91], cited in 
Amin bin Abdullah
 at [73]), for example, if there are substantial aggravating factors such as violence used or an exploitation of a particularly vulnerable class of victims.
41     For the avoidance of doubt, I should add that the sentencing framework outlined above applies equally where the victim is male, which was the case in 
Gee Ah Meng
 and 
Tan Kok Leong
 (although the accused in the latter case was charged under s 354(1) of the Penal Code for outrage of modesty 
simpliciter
). The offence in s 354(2) itself is one perpetrated against “any 
person
 under 14 years of age” [emphasis added] and the provision does not make a distinction based on the gender of the victim. This is for good reason: the offence of outrage of modesty – whether against a male or female victim – is reprehensible, especially when committed against a minor under the age of 14. The court ought to give effect to this through parity in sentencing regardless of the gender of the victim.
Application to the present case
42     Applying the framework to the present case, I begin by identifying the offence-specific aggravating factors. The appellant fondled the victim’s breasts for about five minutes. He then touched and licked her vagina for another five minutes. This meant that there was skin-to-skin touching of the victim’s private parts and the sexual exploitation lasted for a substantial period. There was a degree of premeditation on the part of the appellant, because he capitalised on the victim’s parents’ domestic dispute the night before the offence and purported to offer the victim a more conducive space for studying, knowing that they would be alone in his flat. The case also presented itself as a paradigm situation where there was an abuse of position of trust in a familial context: the appellant was the victim’s uncle. The victim’s evidence was that she did not immediately tell her parents or her aunt about the appellant’s conduct because she feared that they would not believe her. This underscores the very real concern that the courts have over the difficulty of detection of such cases and consequently, the view that general deterrence must feature prominently in the sentencing equation. Further, it was clear that the victim suffered psychologically. As outlined in Dr Pathy’s report, the victim experienced distress and had self-harm tendencies. She had difficulties concentrating on her studies, felt dirty, and had nightmares and flashbacks of the alleged act.
43     In terms of general aggravating and mitigating factors, I note that the appellant did not plead guilty, which meant that he would not have been eligible for any sentencing discount. In fact, he did not display any semblance of remorse for his conduct. Instead, he disparaged the victim’s character and imputed various fabricated motives to her for making allegedly false accusations against him.
44     In view of the totality of the aggravating factors in the present case, I was of the view that the appellant’s conduct would fall within the middle to upper range of Band 2, with a sentence in the region of at least 24 months. In my judgment, the sentence ought to have been calibrated at a higher level than the 21 months imposed by the District Judge. At the same time, I was not convinced that a sentence as high as 27 months sought by the Prosecution was warranted. In the circumstances, I considered that a sentence of 25 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate. The caning imposed remained at four strokes.
Conclusion
45     For the above reasons, the appellant’s appeals against his conviction and sentence were dismissed. The Prosecution’s cross-appeal against sentence was allowed and the appellant’s imprisonment term was increased to 25 months. The caning imposed remained at four strokes. As at the date of this judgment, the appellant has begun serving his sentence.",2017-11-15 00:00:00,SG High Court

Introduction
1       The appellant was convicted after having claimed trial to one charge under s 3 of the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189, 2000 Rev Ed) (“the MVA”) and another under s 35 of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) (“the RTA”). He was found guilty of permitting his employee to use a motor lorry (“the lorry”) without an insurance policy in force in relation to his employee’s use of the lorry, and of permitting him to drive the lorry when he did not have the requisite driving licence. For the MVA charge, he was fined $700 and disqualified from driving all classes of vehicles for 12 months. For the RTA charge, he was fined $800. The total sentence was a fine of $1,500 (in default 15 days’ imprisonment) and disqualification from holding or obtaining a driving licence for all classes of vehicles for 12 months, with effect from 16 May 2017, the date of conviction.
2       The appellant appealed against the order of disqualification in respect of the MVA charge. The District Judge’s findings and reasons for her decision are set out in her grounds of decision in 
Public Prosecutor v Prathib s/o M. Balan
 
[2017] SGDC 161
 (“the GD”). After hearing the parties’ submissions on 27 September 2017, I dismissed the appeal and I now set out the grounds for my decision.
The charge 
3       The MVA charge in question was as follows:
You […] are charged that you, on 09.10.2013 at about 03.22 pm at Bukit Ho Swee Crescent, being the Sole-Proprietor of Falcon Logistics SVCS, the registered owner of motor lorry No. YM 7922 D, did permit one Krishnan S/O Shanmugam to use the said vehicle when there was not in force in relation to the use of the said vehicle such a policy of insurance in respect of third party risks as complies with the requirement of the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks and Compensation) Act, Chapter 189 and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 3(1) and punishable under Section 3(2) of the said Act, Chapter 189.
The District Judge’s decision
4       Having duly considered the evidence adduced at trial, the District Judge was satisfied that the appellant had permitted his employee to drive the lorry. She rejected the appellant’s defence that he had simply given strict instructions to all his employees not to drive (at [10] of the GD). In addition, the District Judge found that there were no facts peculiar to the offence which would have constituted “special reasons” under the MVA, in the absence of which the appellant would be subject to the mandatory minimum of 12 months’ disqualification (at [9]–[10] of the GD).
5       The appellant was thus given a 12-month order of disqualification from driving for the MVA charge. The appeal was filed in relation to this order only.
The appeal 
The relevant statutory provisions
6       The primary issue on appeal was whether the disqualification order for contravening s 3(1) of the MVA should be upheld, 
ie
, whether there were any circumstances which amounted to “special reasons” under s 3(3) of the MVA. Sections 3(1) and 3(3) provide that:
 
Users of motor vehicles to be insured against third-party risks
 
3.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, it shall not be lawful for any person to use or 
to cause or permit any other person to use
 —
(a)     
a motor vehicle in Singapore
; or
(b)    a motor vehicle which is registered in Singapore in any territory specified in the Schedule,
 
unless
 there is in force in relation to the use of the motor vehicle by that person or that other person, as the case may be, such 
a policy of insurance
 or such a security in respect of third-party risks as complies with the requirements of this Act.
[…]
(3)    A person convicted of an offence under this section 
shall
 (
unless
 the court for 
special reasons
 thinks fit to order otherwise and without prejudice to the power of the court to order a longer period of disqualification) 
be disqualified
 for holding or obtaining a driving licence under the Road Traffic Act (Cap. 276) 
for a period of 12 months from the date of the conviction
.
[emphasis added in bold italics]
Summary of the arguments on appeal
7       The appellant’s submissions were premised on the following arguments. First, the interpretation of “special reasons” in 
Muhammad Faizal bin Rahim v Public Prosecutor
 
[2012] 1 SLR 116
 (“
Muhammad Faizal
”), which excludes factors relating to the personal circumstances of the offender, is not good law as there would hardly be any circumstances that will amount to “special reasons”; and there is insufficient distinction in sentencing for different types of moral culpability (
ie
, driving without a licence as against permitting someone else to drive without a licence). Second, the reasoning in 
Ho Chun Kow v Public Prosecutor
 
[1990] 1 SLR(R) 575
 (“
Ho Chun Kow
”) should be adopted in recognising a distinction between an offence involving a person who drives and a person who permits another person to drive. Third, the following circumstances are sufficient to constitute “special reasons”: (a) the appellant did not permit his employee to drive the lorry; (b) the appellant merely failed to enforce or ensure compliance with respect to allowing only licensed employees to drive; (c) the appellant was not the driver, and had merely been convicted of permitting his employee, who had no Class 4 driving licence, to drive a Class 4 vehicle; (d) the appellant’s employee had a Class 3 driving licence, and was permitted to drive a vehicle; (e) the appellant’s offence was not deliberate; and (f) the insurance company would undertake liability in the event of an accident. Finally, a sentencing discount, in light of the three months’ disqualification already served by the appellant, should be granted.
8       The respondent in turn submitted that the legal position on “special reasons” is well-settled, as affirmed in 
Muhammad Faizal
, which rejected a more expansive interpretation encompassing the personal circumstances of the offender, in light of the policy considerations and seriousness of the offence under s 3(1) of the MVA. Also, there was no evidence of any “special reason” that justified a reduction or setting aside of the 12-month disqualification order. The District Judge had convicted the appellant on the basis that he had permitted his employee to drive the lorry, and the appellant had not appealed against his conviction. Moreover, the appellant was aware that the lorry was a Class 4 vehicle, and that his employee did not possess a Class 4 driving licence. The appellant had permitted his employee to drive the lorry for months without a valid policy of insurance in force until this was detected by the authorities. This squarely engaged the policy of deterrence under s 3(1) of the MVA. Finally, the case authorities of 
Toh Yong Soon v Public Prosecutor
 
[2011] 3 SLR 147
 (“
Toh Yong Soon
”) and 
Siti Hajar bte Abdullah v Public Prosecutor
 
[2006] 2 SLR(R) 248
 (“
Siti Hajar bte Abdullah
”) demonstrate that s 3(1) of the MVA applies equally to punish those who drive, and those who cause or permit another to drive without insurance coverage, with 12-month disqualification terms.
My decision
Principles to be applied in determining “special reasons” 
9       As a starting point, in 
Stewart Ashley James v Public Prosecutor
 
[1996] 3 SLR(R) 106
 (“
Stewart Ashley James
”), Yong Pung How CJ held at [10] that the effect of s 3(2) (now s 3(3)) of the MVA is that disqualification will normally be ordered upon conviction, unless there are “special reasons”. Similarly, the District Judge observed that she was compelled to impose the mandatory minimum of 12 months’ disqualification upon conviction, unless “special reasons” were shown (at [9]–[10], [27] of the GD). However, I note that in 
M V Balakrishnan v Public Prosecutor
 
[1998] 2 SLR(R) 846
, it was clarified at [7] that legislation (such as s 3(3) of the MVA) providing that the court shall impose disqualification unless “special reasons” exist does not remove the court’s discretion; it merely provides guidance with respect to the circumstances in which the disqualification should be dispensed with. Nonetheless, the court has no discretion with respect to limiting the classes of vehicles; it was held in 
Stewart Ashley James
 at [11] that a disqualification order under s 3(3) of the MVA must extend to all classes of vehicles.
10     Further, in 
Sivakumar s/o Rajoo v Public Prosecutor
 
[2002] 1 SLR(R) 265
, it was observed at [22] that even if “special reasons” are established, the court may still make a disqualification order, as it must separately consider whether the discretion must be exercised in favour of the offender. This is because disqualification should only not be ordered in very exceptional circumstances, taking into account special circumstances and the totality of the circumstances surrounding the offence (at [25]). Similarly, in 
Siti Hajar bte Abdullah
, it was held at [8] that the test for “special reasons” was a stringent one and would only be satisfied in exceptional circumstances as a less restrictive approach would render the legislative stipulation of mandatory disqualification nugatory and defeat its underlying objectives.
11     I concurred with the respondent’s submission that the legal position on “special reasons” is well-settled. Only factors which relate to the facts or circumstances of the offence, and not factors which relate to the personal circumstances of the offender, are to be considered. The fact that there may be only a few circumstances that will amount to “special reasons”, as contended by the appellant, precisely reflects the policy considerations and seriousness of the offence under s 3(1) of the MVA. The following was elucidated by Tay Yong Kwang J (as he then was) in 
Muhammad Faizal
 at [39]–[41]: (a) the policy underlying s 3(1) of the MVA is to ensure that compensation, via insurance taken out by vehicle owners, would be available in the event of road accidents; (b) causing a vehicle to be used, when there is no insurance policy in force, is a serious offence; (c) the seriousness of the offence is reflected in a possible imprisonment sentence, and the policy behind the 12-month disqualification order is deterrence; and (d) widening the “special reasons” exception would encourage frivolous defences that could derogate from the policy behind s 3(1) of the MVA.
Whether there were any circumstances which amounted to “special reasons” 
12     In my judgment, none of the circumstances raised by the appellant amounted to “special reasons” under s 3(3) of the MVA. The fact that the appellant claimed that he did not permit his employee to drive the motor lorry, and claimed (only in mitigation) that he made a police report with respect to his employee driving the motor lorry without his permission, was insufficient. He had chosen not to appeal against his conviction and I saw no reason to permit him to raise these contentions by the “back-door” as it were. The appellant bore the burden of proving the “special reason” by adducing evidence formally, which he had failed to do beyond his mere assertions. This lack of evidence is similar to the circumstances in the case of 
Siti Hajar bte Abdullah
, where the offender did not produce “a scintilla of evidence” to support her need for immediate medical assistance since no medical certificates or doctors’ reports were adduced to prove the severity of her affliction. The High Court therefore held at [12] that without any details of her condition, it was impossible to determine if she required urgent medical attention, and if any “special reason” was made out. In essence, as held by Choo Han Teck J in 
Toh Yong Soon
 at [5], the appellant must prove the “special reason”, which is a question of fact, to the satisfaction of the court.
13     In any event, I was of the view that the appellant could be regarded as having permitted (under s 3(1) of the MVA) his employee to use the motor lorry even if he did not give express or implied consent, and any lack of permission and his failure to enforce or ensure compliance (as argued by the appellant) was not a “special reason”. What the prosecution is required to show is that the offender had some form of control, direction, and mandate over the person to prevent him from using the vehicle unlawfully. In 
Chua Chye Tiong v Public Prosecutor
 
[2004] 1 SLR(R) 22
 at [21]–[24], the fact that the offender was the manager of a motorcar trading company meant that he had a “mandate” or “control” over persons who wished to drive the vehicles from the premises. He had endorsed a lax practice that granted potential drivers unauthorised access to vehicles, and he had a form of “mandate” to prevent a person from using the vehicle unlawfully, even if he did not give express or implied consent to that person. In the present case, the respondent went further and showed that the appellant had, in fact, 
permitted
 his employee to drive, while knowing he did not hold a valid Class 4 driving licence. As the respondent rightly pointed out, the appellant had accepted that he had permitted his employee to drive the lorry since he had not appealed against his conviction which was premised upon that fact.
14     Additionally, I agreed with the respondent’s submission that the case authorities of 
Siti Hajar bte Abdullah
 and 
Toh Yong Soon
 demonstrate that s 3(1) of the MVA applies equally to those who drive and those who permit another person to drive. 
A fortiori
, the fact that the appellant was not the driver and had instead been convicted of permitting his employee, who had no Class 4 driving licence, to drive a Class 4 vehicle (as argued by the appellant) is not a “special reason”. In 
Siti Hajar bte Abdullah
, the offender was not treated any differently by the court even though she was not the driver and had merely permitted her cousin, who did not have a valid driving licence, to drive (as she required medical attention). Similarly, in 
Toh Yong Soon
, the offender was not treated any differently by the court even though he was not the driver and had merely permitted his employee, who had no driving licence, to drive (as he believed his employee had a valid driving licence). Accordingly, I did not accept the appellant’s submission that the reasoning in 
Ho Chun Kow
 should be adopted in recognising a distinction between an offence involving a person who drives and a person who permits another person to drive. It is unnecessary to make further reference to 
Ho Chun Kow
, which involves the interpretation of traffic offence provisions unrelated to the present case (under ss 42(1) and 68(1) of the RTA), to ascertain the meaning of s 3 of the MVA, in the light of 
Toh Yong Soon
, where Choo Han Teck J considered the meaning of s 3 of the MVA and held at [4] that it clearly and unambiguously applies not only to the person who drives but also to the person who permits another to drive.
15     As noted at [7] above, the appellant contended that the fact that his employee had a Class 3 driving licence and was permitted to drive vehicles, albeit from a different class, when he was supposed to have a Class 4 driving licence, should be a “special reason”. It is clear that such a factor is not a “special reason” from, 
eg
, 
Public Prosecutor v Mohamed Fuad Bin Abdul Samad
 
[2014] SGDC 178
 (“
Mohamed Fuad
”) at [56] and [66], where the fact that the offender caused someone who had a driving licence and was qualified to drive, when he was supposed to be covered by the insurance policy but was not as he had less than two years of driving experience, was not a “special reason”. Further, the fact that the appellant’s offence was not deliberate was not a “special reason” either. Again in 
Mohamed Fuad
 at [56] and [66], the fact that the accused did not deliberately contravene s 3(1) of the MVA was not a “special reason”. In any case, the appellant’s offence was in fact a deliberate breach, as he had permitted his employee to drive while knowing he did not hold a valid Class 4 driving licence.
16     Finally, while in 
Public Prosecutor v Chen Horng Yeh David
 
[2007] SGDC 326
 (cited by Choo Han Teck J in 
Toh Yong Soon
 at [5]) it was held at [14]–[17] that the fact that the insurance company would undertake liability in the event of an accident is a “special reason”, I found the reliance on such an argument by the appellant completely unsupported by the facts. As highlighted by the respondent, the underwriting manager of Tokio Marine Insurance (which provided the insurance policy for the lorry in question) had testified during trial that there would not be insurance coverage for the lorry if the person driving was not permitted by law to drive it, and hence, it is evident that there would be no “special reason” in this case. In the premises, I was satisfied that none of the circumstances raised by the appellant amounted to any “special reasons” and the appeal was wholly unmeritorious.
Whether the court has the power to stay disqualification pending appeal
17     It is pertinent to note that after the appellant filed his appeal, he made an application to the District Judge on 6 June 2017 for a stay of his disqualification order pending appeal. On the same day, the District Judge dismissed the stay application. The District Judge was of the view that she had no discretion to grant a stay pending appeal, since s 3(3) of the MVA mandated that the disqualification was to begin from the date of the conviction, and not from any other date (at [13] and [23] of the GD). Also, the District Judge found that in the light of s 3(3) of the MVA and s 42(4) of the RTA, the intent of s 3(5) of the MVA was equivocal (at [19]–[20] of the GD).
18     Following the dismissal of his stay application, the appellant filed Criminal Motion No 25 of 2017 (“the Criminal Motion”) on 22 June 2017 seeking a stay of the disqualification order pending appeal. The Criminal Motion was granted by Chan Seng Onn J on 18 August 2017. The respondent did not object to the application. In his submissions, the appellant argued that s 42(4) of the RTA, read with s 3(5) of the MVA, confers upon the court the power to stay the disqualification order pending appeal. The respondent in turn submitted, and also highlighted to me at the hearing of this appeal, that regardless of the provisions of the MVA and the RTA, s 383(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) provides the court with the power to stay the disqualification order pending appeal.
19     Notwithstanding that the Criminal Motion had already been granted, this outcome had arisen because the respondent had accepted that a stay could be validly ordered and had consented to the application. The District Judge had furnished her reasons for declining to grant a stay and addressed this in some detail (at [12]–[24] of the GD). As this involved a point of law on which there appears to have been no prior guidance from the High Court, I considered that it would be helpful to outline my views as to why the court has the power to stay disqualification ordered under the MVA pending appeal.
20     The relevant statutory provisions, in addition to ss 3(1) and 3(3) of the MVA (see [6] above), are s 3(5) of the MVA, which provides that a person disqualified under s 3 of the MVA shall be deemed to be disqualified under the RTA (for the purposes of Part II of the RTA); and s 42(4) of the RTA (which is within Part II of the RTA), which provides that the court has the power to stay a disqualification order pending appeal:
 
Users of motor vehicles to be insured against third-party risks
 
3    […]
(5)    A person 
disqualified by virtue of a conviction under this section
 or of an order made thereunder for holding or obtaining a driving licence 
shall for the purposes of Part II of the Road Traffic Act be deemed to be disqualified by virtue of a conviction under the provisions of that Part
.
 
Disqualification for offences
 
42    […]
(4)    A person who, by virtue of an order of court, is disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence 
may appeal against the order
 in the same manner as against a conviction, and 
the court may if it thinks fit, pending the appeal, suspend the operation of the order
.

21     In 
Knowler v Rennison
 
[1947] 1 KB 488
 (HC) (“
Knowler v Rennison
”), cited with approval in 
Siti Hajar bte Abdullah
 at [19], the accused was convicted under s 35(1) of the UK Road Traffic Act 1930 (Cap 43) (“UKRTA”) (
in pari materia
 with s 3(1) of the MVA) for causing his motorcycle to be used without a policy of insurance. The Court of Petty Sessions imposed a fine and a 12-month disqualification, under s 35(2) of the UKRTA (
in pari materia
 with ss 3(2), 3(3), and 3(5) of the MVA). On appeal, the disqualification was removed, as it was found that the accused had an honest belief that there was a policy of insurance in force, which was a “special reason”. On further appeal to the High Court, the disqualification order was reinstated. It was held that a misapprehension as to the effect of a policy of insurance was not a “special reason”. Lord Goddard CJ observed at pp 496–497 that s 6(2) (
in pari materia
 with s 42(4) of the RTA) read with s 35(2) of the UKRTA conferred the court with the power to stay the disqualification order pending appeal.
22     Similarly, in 
Public Prosecutor v Muhammad Haidhir Bin Raub
 
[2016] SGDC 19
 (“
Muhammad Haidhir
”), the accused was convicted for an offence under s 3(1) of the MVA, for causing his father to drive a heavy vehicle without valid insurance. The court imposed a fine of $600 (in default two days’ imprisonment) and a 12-month disqualification, pursuant to ss 3(2) and 3(3) of the MVA. Pending appeal, the District Judge allowed the accused’s application for a stay of the disqualification order. It was observed at [28] that s 42(4) of the RTA provides the court with the discretion to suspend the operation of a disqualification order pending an appeal, and it was implicitly accepted that the power of stay also applies to disqualification ordered under s 3(3) of the MVA. This was justified on the basis that it would avoid possible prejudice to the defendant if he is eventually successful on appeal or even in applying to retract a plea of guilt (at [29]).
23     A stay of disqualification ordered under s 3(3) of the MVA pending appeal was also granted in the following cases: 
Public Prosecutor v Xu Feng Jia
 
[2016] SGDC 160
 at [136] (where s 42(4) of the RTA was also cited); 
Public Prosecutor v Chia Hong Quan
 
[2015] SGDC 33
 at [26] (a matter heard before the same District Judge who heard the present case); 
Public Prosecutor v Aw Yick Hong
 
[2014] SGDC 275
 at [52]; 
Public Prosecutor v Viswamoorthy s/o Ramanthan
 
[2009] SGDC 243
 at [4]; 
Public Prosecutor v Edmund Wang Choon Teck
 
[2009] SGDC 178
 at [33]; and 
Chua Chye Tiong v Public Prosecutor
 
[2003] SGDC 188
 at [36]. This list of cases may not be exhaustive but it would appear that the weight of precedent leans strongly in favour of acknowledging that the court has the power to grant a stay pending appeal. I am conscious however that no arguments on the court’s power to make such orders had surfaced in those cases, and correspondingly no reasons for making the orders were stated.
24     In my view, 
Knowler v Rennison
 and 
Muhammad Haidhir
, together with the other aforementioned cases, demonstrate that s 42(4) of the RTA, read with s 3(5) of the MVA, confers upon the court the power to stay disqualification ordered under s 3(3) of the MVA pending appeal. Such a reading of the MVA together with the RTA is supported by legislative history. During the second and third readings of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Ordinance (No 1 of 1960) (“MVO”), the phrase “under the Road Traffic Ordinance” (now “under the Road Traffic Act (Cap. 276)” under s 3(3) of the MVA) was added to s 3(2) of the MVO. It was explained by Mr K M Byrne, the then Minister for Labour and Law, that such an amendment was necessary to tie up the MVO with the Road Traffic Ordinance, since a driving licence is issued under the latter (see 
Singapore Parliamentary Debates
, 
Official Report
 (13 January 1960) vol 21 at col 19). This lends support for the view that the legislature intended that the MVA be read closely and harmoniously with the RTA, in particular where the disqualification of a driving licence is concerned. Also, policy considerations would lead logically to the same result. The MVA and the RTA provisions on disqualification should be read and understood to apply together seamlessly throughout the trial and appeal process, so that there would be no gaps which may undermine the administration of justice.
25     The District Judge opined that where the statutory provision (such as s 3(3) of the MVA) states that the period of disqualification is to commence with effect from the date of the conviction, these “clear and unambiguous” words indicate that the court does not have any discretion as to the commencement date for the disqualification period (see [13] of the GD). She contrasted s 3(3) of the MVA with s 42(4) of the RTA which expressly allows for a stay of the disqualification order.
26     In my assessment of the seeming inconsistency between these provisions, with respect, a plain reading of s 42(4) of the RTA would suggest that it applies to 
all
 disqualification orders meted out by a court. Unlike s 42(3) of the RTA, which is qualified by the words “any disqualification imposed 
under this section
”, no such words of limitation appear in s 42(4). There are also clear instances of other disqualification orders meted out by the courts pertaining to driving-related offences which are not ordered pursuant to s 42(1) of the RTA. These include disqualification orders under ss 379A(2), 411(2)(
b
) and 414(2)(
b
) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed), all of which would similarly engage s 42(4) of the RTA.
27     To my mind, the absence of an express provision in the MVA permitting a stay or suspension of disqualification does not preclude the use of s 42(4) of the RTA. Bearing in mind the preceding analysis of the legislative history and the policy considerations underpinning the relevant provisions in the MVA and RTA, I am of the view that there is no inconsistency between these provisions if s 42(4) of the RTA is read such that it applies to all disqualification orders made by the court. This construction would also allow for a harmonious reading of both the MVA and RTA provisions. It could not have been Parliament’s intent that these statutes should conflict with one another.
28     In any case, as pointed out by the respondent in its written submissions for the Criminal Motion, s 383(1) of the CPC provides the court with the general power to stay the disqualification order pending appeal. The respondent noted that the District Judge did not appear to have considered s 383(1) of the CPC in the GD when she decided that she had no discretion to stay the disqualification order. That said, the appellant had also not brought s 383(1) to the District Judge’s attention when applying for a stay. Section 383(1) provides as follows:
 
Stay of execution pending appeal
 
383.–(1) An appeal shall not operate as a stay of execution, but 
the trial court and the appellate court may stay execution on any judgment, sentence or order pending appeal
, on any terms as to security for the payment of money or the performance or non-performance of an act or the suffering of a punishment imposed by the judgment, sentence or order as to the court seem reasonable.
[emphasis added in bold italics]
29     Pursuant to s 4 of the CPC, s 383(1) of the CPC applies to offences under any written law including the RTA and the MVA. In 
Public Prosecutor v Ho Soo Hiam
 
[2015] SGDC 18
 at [9], a disqualification order under the RTA was stayed under s 383(1) of the CPC pending appeal, and the operation of the order was also suspended under s 42(4) of the RTA pending appeal.
30     There is no reason why the trial court cannot have the power to stay a disqualification order made pursuant to s 3(3) of the MVA pending appeal, under s 42(4) of the RTA read with s 3(5) of the MVA. This is in fact buttressed by the general power to stay execution as provided under s 383(1) of the CPC. I find therefore that the power to stay a disqualification order pending appeal is justified and necessary, to ensure that the accused is not unduly prejudiced while awaiting the outcome of his appeal. Such an approach is entirely consonant with the views expressed by the High Court in the recent decisions of 
Rajendar Prasad Rai and another v Public Prosecutor and another matter
 
[2017] SGHC 187
 and 
Bander Yahya A Alzahrani v Public Prosecutor
 
[2017] SGHC 287
, albeit in slightly different contexts involving stay of execution pending a criminal reference or an application for leave to bring a criminal reference. The underlying principle is similar: to avoid undue prejudice to an accused person where an earlier order or sentence may be revised. Whether the court should exercise its discretion to stay execution in a particular case is of course a separate matter.
31     For completeness, I would further observe that in a situation such as the present, where the appellate court has found no merit in the appeal against disqualification, the dismissal of the appeal cannot be taken to mean that the disqualification must then be ordered to take effect retrospectively 
ie
. “from the date of the conviction” below. If a stay had been ordered, and if the appeal is subsequently dismissed, the only sensible result must be that the disqualification (or any remaining duration of it) commences from the date the conviction (or sentence) is 
affirmed
 on appeal. The disqualification order may be rendered wholly nugatory otherwise, should the appeal take some time to be heard.
Conclusion
32     For the foregoing reasons, I was not persuaded that there were any circumstances which amounted to a “special reason”’ under the MVA. Accordingly, I dismissed the appeal against the order of disqualification. Since the appellant had already served three months of his disqualification, he was only required to serve the remaining nine months from the date the appeal was dismissed, 
ie
, 27 September 2017. There was no appeal against the fines imposed, and I understand that they had been paid in full.",2017-11-22 00:00:00,SG High Court

 Choo Han Teck J:
1       The accused pleaded guilty to and was convicted for three drug related offences. The first involved having not less than 249.99g of methamphetamine in his possession for the purpose of trafficking (“the First Charge”). The second was for trafficking in not less than 97.9g of methamphetamine (“the Fourth Charge”) and the third was for consumption of methamphetamine (“the Fifth Charge”). Two other charges for trafficking in methamphetamine were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.
2       The minimum sentence for the First Charge as prescribed by law is 20 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane whilst that for the Fourth Charge is 5 years’ imprisonment and five strokes of the cane. There is no mandatory minimum sentence for the Fifth Charge. The learned DPP submitted that the following sentences would be appropriate: a term of imprisonment of at least 28 years and 15 strokes of the cane for the First Charge; a term of imprisonment of at least seven years and seven strokes of the cane for the Fourth Charge; and a term of imprisonment of at least 12 months for the Fifth Charge. The learned DPP argued that the sentences for the First Charge and Fifth Charge should run consecutively, resulting in a global sentence of at least 29 years’ imprisonment and 22 strokes of the cane.
3       The learned DPP asked for the ‘benchmark sentences’ to be applied, submitting that the appropriate starting point for the First Charge would be between 26 and 29 years’ imprisonment. Three main justifications were offered to support the learned DPP’s submission for a sentence of at least 28 years’ imprisonment — the sophistication of the drug syndicate, the accused’s key role in the drug operation and his being motivated by financial reward.
4       It is apparent that the drug syndicate under which the accused operated was highly sophisticated. The syndicate’s mode of trafficking drugs was described as such — the packets of methamphetamine would be disguised as boxes and packets containing Chinese tea. The syndicate would then ship these boxes and packets from China. They also used SingPost delivery services to send the drugs to the residential unit where the accused stayed in. The learned DPP compared this sophisticated modus operandi to the simpler ones adopted by Malaysian-based syndicates which rely on individuals to personally import the drugs into Singapore to justify the Prosecution’s submission that a higher sentence ought to be meted out.
5       The operation as a whole may have the features of a sophisticated and syndicated crime. But, when considering the sentence presently, one must also not lose sight of other relevant factors. Although it is true that the overall modus operandi of the syndicate was sophisticated, the role played by the accused here was minimal. The accused was first approached by a co-accused, Jivan, and was asked to help in exchange for obtaining drugs at a cheaper price and the possibility of selling it on to others for a profit. A month later, Jivan approached the accused again, saying that he had rented a place. The accused asked if he could stay in the rented unit and Jivan agreed. It was only then that the accused agreed to help with the drug operation. The accused’s role was to receive parcels of drugs sent to Jivan and to repack and deliver them on according to Jivan’s instructions.
6       At the time of arrest, the accused was 20 years old and a drug addict himself. He agreed to help Jivan in part to feed his own addiction and in part to secure a roof over his head. His involvement in the syndicate was limited to helping Jivan and acting on Jivan’s sole instructions. He did not interact with anyone else in the syndicate network. The accused was only involved in the repacking and delivery of drugs for four months before being arrested. There is no evidence that the accused had any role in or knowledge of the sophistication of the operation.
7       I therefore imposed a sentence of 23 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane for the First Charge, five years’ imprisonment and five strokes of the cane for the Fourth Charge and 1 year’ imprisonment for the Fifth Charge. I ordered the sentence of the First Charge and the Fourth Charge to run concurrently and the sentence of the Fifth Charge to run consecutively with that of the First Charge and the Fourth Charge. This will result in a global sentence of 24 years’ imprisonment with 20 strokes of the cane. The terms of imprisonment shall commence with effect from the date of arrest, 3 August 2015.",2017-11-13 00:00:00,SG High Court

 Debbie Ong J:
1       This suit was initially brought by the plaintiff, the Singapore Shooting Association (“SSA”), against the defendant, the Singapore Rifle Association (“SRA”) to, amongst other things, recover vacant possession of the land and premises at 990 Old Choa Chu Kang Road Singapore 699814 (“the Premises”), known as the National Shooting Centre (“NSC”). The SRA counterclaimed against the SSA to seek compensation for losses caused by two floods that occurred on the Premises on 24 December 2014 and 3 May 2015 (the “1st Flood” and the “2nd Flood” respectively), allegedly through the SSA’s negligence. Subsequently, the SSA withdrew its claim against the SRA, such that only the SRA’s counterclaim remained.
2       On 3 July 2017, I dismissed the counterclaim in relation to the 1st Flood but found the SSA liable to the SRA for losses of $4,708 expended on cleaning works as a result of the 2nd Flood. The SRA has appealed against my decision and I now set out the full written grounds for my decision.
Background facts
3       The SSA is the National Association for the sport of shooting in Singapore. At the material time, the SSA was leasing the Premises from Sport Singapore (then known as the Singapore Sports Council) under a lease agreement dated 29 December 2008.
4       The SRA is one of the founding member clubs of the SSA. Since 2000, the SSA has allowed the SRA to occupy and manage part of the NSC, including two areas known as the SRA Armoury and the SRA Office. The SRA Armoury was one of two armouries located in the basement of the NSC main building. The SRA Armoury stored firearms and ammunition owned by the SRA, individual members of the SRA, the Home Team Sports and Recreation Association and the Singapore Armed Forces Sports Association Shooting Club. The SRA Office was located in the NSC main building. The SRA also operated the pistol and rifle shooting ranges at the NSC.
5       There were no contracts between the SSA and the SRA formalising this arrangement for the SRA’s use of the Premises for approximately 10 years. This arrangement was agreed upon at General Meetings of the SSA’s member clubs or at meetings of the SSA’s Council. On 19 March 2011, the parties entered into an Operator Agreement under which the SRA was appointed the sole and exclusive operator and manager of parts of the NSC, including the SRA Armoury, the SRA Office and the pistol and rifle shooting ranges. On 18 November 2014, the parties signed a Proprietary Range Agreement which terminated the Operator Agreement and, in its place, granted the SRA rights to an area specified in a schedule for the purposes of constructing and operating a club range. It is undisputed that the SRA continued to occupy and use the SRA Armoury even though the SRA Armoury was not part of the specified area in the schedule to the Proprietary Range Agreement. The SSA accepted that at the material time, the SRA was granted a gratuitous licence to occupy the SRA Armoury at least up to the time of the two floods. The SRA contended that it was granted a sub-lease, but this distinction was not material to the issues before me.
6       For the purposes of the following discussion, it will help to bear in mind a rough layout of the Premises. The NSC main building, which houses the SRA Armoury, was located at the south-eastern end of the Premises. An unlined earth drain (“the unlined drain”) ran north-west across the Premises. Three crossings had been built over the unlined drain. Each crossing carried a culvert underneath, 
ie
, a drainage pipe through which water could flow from one section of the unlined drain to the next. The three culverts were marked out as Culverts A, B and C, with Culvert A being closest in distance to the SRA Armoury. Barring any obstruction in water flow, water would flow downstream in the direction from Culvert A to Culvert C and onwards out of the Premises. A diagram of the Premises may be found in the annex to these grounds of decision.
Renovation works on the Premises
7       Members of the SRA claimed that between August 2013 and December 2014, trucks carrying full loads of earth fill material and debris frequently entered the Premises. These trucks were observed unloading and dumping the earth fill material at various parts of the Premises and then leaving the Premises empty. The SSA and Sport Singapore each claimed the other had engaged the trucks to dump the material on the Premises. The SSA pleaded that the earth fill material was dumped on the Premises to build stop-butts for a new 25m range, increase the height of existing stop-butts and fill the trench between the existing ranges A and B to build a third range. The SRA’s representatives disputed this because they observed the trucks dumping earth fill material in areas other than where the said stop-butts and trench were situated.
8       On 30 October 2013, the SSA and Sport Singapore handed over the Premises to a contractor for refurbishment and renovation works to be carried out for the Southeast Asian Games (“SEA Games”). It was not disputed that it was Sport Singapore who had engaged the contractor to carry out these renovation works and that such works included at least some drainage infrastructure works. The Premises were handed back by the contractor to Sport Singapore and in turn to the SSA on 1 December 2014.
9       The parties disputed the exact areas of the Premises that were handed over to Sport Singapore and the scope of works that Sport Singapore had authorised on the Premises. The SSA’s case was that it had handed over the whole of the Premises (save for the NSC main building) to Sport Singapore for the purposes of the renovation and did not itself authorise or pay for any works on the unlined drain between 30 October 2013 and 1 December 2014. In contrast, the SRA contended that Sport Singapore did not take over the whole Premises but only the parts of it where works were carried out. In particular, Sport Singapore did not control or authorise any works to be carried out at the embankment along the unlined drain between Culverts B and C. Mr Lenard Pattiselanno, currently the director of the National Sports Association Partnership Division in Sport Singapore, testified pursuant to a subpoena issued by the SRA.
The floods
10     On 24 December 2014, less than a month after the completion of the SEA Games renovation, the 1st Flood occurred at the Premises. The basement of the NSC main building was flooded to a height of approximately 1m. Mr Conrad Chung from the SRA and Mr David Lieu from the SSA traced the source of the water from further downstream along the unlined drain. They noticed that somewhere near Culvert C, there was what Mr Chung termed a “failed slope” or “landslide”. From photographic evidence, I gathered that the soil from the slope lining one side of the unlined drain had slid into the unlined drain. It appeared to Mr Chung that the soil that had slid into the unlined drain was preventing water in the unlined drain from flowing through Culvert C and out of the NSC. He observed a backflow of water towards the NSC main building. After requisitioning two water pumps to pump water out of the basement of the NSC main building as well as a long arm excavator to clear the failed slope, the water level receded. However, ammunition and target papers had been submerged in water for hours.
11     To investigate the cause of the 1st Flood, the SRA engaged Professor Vladan Babovic, an expert in hydrology, to give an expert opinion on the cause of the flood and advise the SRA on steps to prevent future flooding. Professor Babovic produced a Flood Assessment Report in January 2015. He testified as an expert witness for the SRA in this trial.
12     On 10 January 2015, the SSA’s Council convened a Board of Inquiry (“BOI”) chaired by Mr Lim Kim Lye. The BOI was tasked to determine the probable cause of the flood, identify contributing factors, review the effectiveness of the remedies implemented by the SRA after past floods and propose remedies to prevent the recurrence of a flood. The BOI considered photographs, site visits and Professor Babovic’s Flood Assessment Report. In its report dated 12 March 2015, the BOI concluded that the 1st Flood was caused by a combination of (a) unforeseen and unprecedented heavy rains; (b) a “landslip” at the unlined drain approximately 320m downstream from the SRA Armoury, which was described as a “failure of the newly constructed embankment between Culverts B and C”; and (c) debris swept upstream which clogged the pipe at Culvert A such that water flowed back upstream. Amongst other solutions, the BOI recommended that a waterway survey be done by a professional agency to assess the drainage infrastructure and soil composition of the Premises and recommend rectification works. Mr Lim conceded under cross-examination that the BOI’s members were not experts in hydrology and engineering and would not be able to identify the “real cause”, ascertain the intensity and frequency of the rainfall event on 24 December 2014, or assess the cause and effect of the landslip.
13     Subsequently, the Public Utilities Board (“the PUB”) surveyed the Premises on 26 March 2015 and 16 April 2015. The PUB advised Sport Singapore that the 1st Flood was caused by the silting of the unlined drain and the obstruction by the crossings. It pointed out that the crossings at Culverts A and C had not been approved by authorities. It recommended adding additional pipes at the culverts or replacing the unauthorised crossings with footbridges. In the short term, regular maintenance of the unlined drain was advised to prevent blockage. Sport Singapore forwarded these recommendations on to the SSA for the SSA to regularise the waterway works at the SSA’s own costs after proper approvals from the authorities and Sport Singapore.
14     On 3 May 2015, the 2nd Flood occurred. The basement of the NSC main building was flooded to a height of approximately 30cm. Mr Marcus Kung from the SRA traced the source of the water and noticed a “landslide” of the unlined drain, which apparently caused a blockage of the unlined drain and resulted in backflow of the water towards the NSC main building. The SRA’s ammunition and target papers were not affected but it incurred cleaning costs. Professor Babovic was later engaged to prepare an addendum report on the 2nd Flood.
The parties’ cases
15     The SRA argued that the SSA, as the lessee and occupier of the Premises, owed a duty of care to the SRA to ensure proper maintenance and supervision of the Premises. The SRA was a lawful entrant and the SSA had consented to and was aware of the SRA’s operations on the Premises. The SRA pleaded that the SSA had breached its duty of care because the SSA:
(a)     failed to properly maintain the Premises;
(b)     failed to adequately monitor, supervise, take necessary measures to ensure safety with any alteration to the Premises;
(c)     failed to adequately monitor, supervise, take necessary measures to prevent damage to the SRA Armoury and its contents therein;
(d)     failed to design, construct and/or maintain the water drainage infrastructure at the shotgun construction range in compliance with various sections of the PUB Code of Practice on Surface Water Draining (6th ed, 2011) (as amended by Addendum No 1 (June 2013)) (“the PUB Code”) and to ensure that it was hydraulically adequate, structurally sound and geotechnically stable;
(e)     failed to seek the approval of the relevant government authorities before altering or interfering with the water drainage infrastructure and/or carrying out the dumping of the earth fill material at the Premises; and
(f)     failed to engage qualified persons to plan, design and install earth control measures and erosion control measures, and to implement soil stabilisation methods to ensure the stability and structural integrity of the drainage infrastructure; and
(g)     in respect of the 2nd Flood, failed to take adequate and/or reasonable steps to remedy the causes of the 1st Flood.
16     The SRA alleged that in respect of both floods, these breaches resulted in a “failed slope or landslide at the water drainage embankment” between Culverts B and C, in turn leading to a backflow of water towards the NSC main building, which caused a flood in the SRA Armoury. The SRA submitted on the basis of its experts’ evidence that the main cause of the 1st Flood was the landslip at the unlined drain between Culverts B and C. The landslip occurred because the slope lining the unlined drain was constructed using unsuitable soil. The SRA submitted that the 2nd Flood was caused by the choking of Culvert B by debris, which likewise caused a backflow. The SRA thus suffered losses in the form of damaged ammunition, target papers that were no longer fit for their purpose, and cleaning costs.
17     In its defence to the counterclaim, the SSA pleaded that the 1st Flood could not have been caused by a landslip or failed slope between Culverts B and C, but was instead caused by unforeseen and unprecedented heavy rains and debris, swept in from an adjacent range, which obstructed Culvert A. In its closing submissions, however, the SSA conceded that the 1st Flood was caused by a landslip because the embankment at the unlined drain was poorly constructed. The SSA denied that it owed the SRA a duty of care as it did not have control over the works done on the unlined drain. It claimed that control of the 
whole
 Premises had been handed over to Sport Singapore, which was responsible for authorising the works and obtaining all necessary approvals. Even if it owed a duty of care to the SRA, the SSA argued that it did not breach its duty as it was justified in relying on Sport Singapore to ensure that the unlined drain was properly constructed. The SSA also disputed the SRA’s proof of loss and damage in respect of the 1st Flood. As for the 2nd Flood, the SSA pleaded that it had not acted unreasonably as it had looked into the causes of the earlier flood but was unable to remedy them before the 2nd Flood occurred. Finally, the SSA submitted that the SRA was contributorily negligent in respect of both floods because the SRA had failed to seal the windows of the SRA Armoury in spite of earlier recommendations.
Issues
18     The law on occupiers’ liability is subsumed under the tort of negligence (
See Toh Siew Kee v Ho Ah Lam Ferrocement (Pte) Ltd and others
 
[2013] 3 SLR 284
 (“
See Toh
”) at [76]). The SRA’s counterclaim was analysed under the tort of negligence. The issues before me were:
(a)     whether the SSA owed a duty of care to the SRA;
(b)     if so, whether the SSA breached its duty of care in respect of the 1st Flood and/or the 2nd Flood;
(c)     if it did, whether the breach caused the 1st Flood and/or the 2nd Flood; and
(d)     if it did, whether the 1st Flood and/or 2nd Flood caused the damages claimed by the SRA.
Duty of care in respect of both floods
19     The test for the duty of care in negligence is set out in 
Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defence Science & Technology Agency
 [2007] 4 SLR (R) 100 (“
Spandeck
”) (at [77] and [83]):
77    The 
first
 stage of the test to be applied to determine the existence of a duty of care is that of proximity, 
ie
, that there must be sufficient 
legal
 proximity between the claimant and defendant for a duty of care to arise. The focus here is necessarily on the closeness of the relationship between the parties themselves ...
…
83    Assuming a positive answer to the preliminary question of factual foreseeability and the first stage of the legal proximity test, a 
prima facie
 duty of care arises. Policy considerations should then be applied to the factual matrix to determine whether or not to negate this duty. Among the relevant policy considerations would be, for example, the presence of a contractual matrix which has clearly defined the rights and liabilities of the parties and the relative bargaining positions of the parties.
[emphasis in original]
20     The factual foreseeability test is readily met in the case of occupiers. This is because it is eminently foreseeable that entrants will suffer damage if occupiers do not take reasonable care to eliminate danger on their premises (
See Toh
 at [77]).
21     Legal proximity includes physical, circumstantial and causal proximity, as well as reliance and voluntary assumption of responsibility (
Spandeck
 at [78]). In the case of lawful entrants, the vast majority of occupiers with control of the property and/or the activities carried out there 
de jure
 owe a 
prima facie
 duty of care to take reasonable care to avoid harm to lawful entrants. As V K Rajah JA explained in 
See Toh
 at [80]:
In so far as cases of 
lawful
 entrants are concerned … circumstantial proximity is tautologically present in the occupier-lawful entrant relationship. To elaborate, the hallmark of a lawful entrant’s presence on an occupier’s premises is consent to his presence on the part of the occupier; it is this consent, which grounds the occupier-lawful entrant relationship and justifies a legal finding that there is proximity between the occupier and the lawful entrant. 
I thus hold that under the first limb of the 
Spandeck 
approach, the 
vast majority 
of occupiers having control of the property which they occupy and/or the activities carried out there 
de jure 
owe a 
prima facie 
duty of care to lawful entrants.
 At the same time, it bears emphasis that not all “occupiers” … owe a 
prima facie
 duty of care to lawful entrants – essentially, this turns on the degree of control which an occupier has over the property concerned and/or the activities carried out there. …
[emphasis in original]
22     Nonetheless, I was also careful to note that this is not a blanket rule and the finding of a duty of care should ultimately turn on the facts of each individual case. Indeed, Sundaresh Menon CJ preferred a different approach (at [130]):
… Rajah JA has said at [80] above that in so far as 
lawful
 entrants are concerned, in ordinary circumstances, subject to the element of control, occupiers will 
de jure
 owe them a 
prima facie
 duty of care as there will be sufficient legal proximity between occupiers and lawful entrants. While this may well be correct as a matter of how the great majority of cases will 
in fact
 be resolved, I prefer to leave this as something to be worked out by reference to the specific facts that will arise on future occasions, rather than by articulating any legal rule or principle to this effect. …
[emphasis in original]
In assessing the facts, the degree of control which an occupier has over the property concerned and/or the activities carried out there must be considered (
See Toh
 at [80]).
23     I was of the view that there was legal proximity between the SSA and the SRA. I found the SRA to be a lawful entrant to the Premises. Significantly, as mentioned at [5] above, the SSA accepted in pleadings and in evidence that at least a gratuitous licence had been granted to the SRA to use the SRA Armoury at the material time. It is a fact that since 2000, the SRA has occupied and used the SRA Armoury, the SRA Office and the pistol and rifle shooting ranges. The SRA continued to do so even after the termination of the Operator Agreement. The parties were therefore not mere strangers brought together only by the alleged negligent act. They had a long relationship which was directly relevant to the question of proximity.
24     It was not disputed that the SSA had entire control of the Premises on the dates of the two floods. Regardless of whether and to what extent the SSA had handed over control of parts of the Premises to Sport Singapore for the purposes of the SEA Games renovation in any prior period, it was undisputed that by 1 December 2014, the SSA had recovered possession of the entire Premises from Sport Singapore.
25     In my view, the SSA’s claim, on the basis of 
See Toh
, that it did not owe any duty of care to the SRA because it did not construct the failed slope and was not in control of the Premises when it was constructed, is misconceived. The alleged cause of the 1st Flood was the static condition of the Premises at the time of the 1st Flood, not any dynamic activities or risky operations being carried on by a third party on the Premises. The present case is thus distinguishable from 
See Toh
. In 
See Toh
, HAL was the lessor and Lal Offshore the sub-lessor of a part of the premises. It was undisputed that “the Mooring Operation which led to [the plaintiff’s] injuries was conducted by Asian Lift, and that HAL and Lal Offshore had no part to play in that operation or in supervising it” (at [134]). The Court of Appeal held that HAL and Lal Offshore did not owe the plaintiff a duty of care. Even if they did, their duty in such a context would only consist of keeping unauthorised persons out of the premises. In contrast, the 1st Flood occurred due to the condition of the Premises. The SSA was occupying the Premises as lessee and had control over the condition of the Premises at the time of the 1st Flood. The alleged negligent act did not arise from a third party’s dynamic activities over which the SSA had no or little control.
26     I therefore found that there was sufficient legal proximity between the SRA and the SSA. I did not find any policy considerations to negate a finding of a duty of care. Thus, the SSA owed the SRA a duty to take reasonable care of the Premises so as to avoid causing harm to the SRA.
The 1st Flood
27     Before I turn to examine the SSA’s alleged breaches leading up to the 1st Flood, I first consider the evidence on what aspect of the Premises was poorly maintained, designed or constructed.
Expert evidence on the cause of the 1st Flood
28     The SRA called two expert witnesses, Professor Babovic, who as mentioned is an expert in hydrology, and Professor Tan Siew Ann, an expert in geotechnical engineering.
29     Professor Babovic gave evidence that the intensity of rainfall experienced on 24 December 2014 occurred approximately once in two years. It was a rainfall event that the Premises should have been designed to withstand (without flooding), and could not be said to be unprecedented.
30     In Professor Babovic’s assessment, the main cause of the 1st Flood was the failed slope between Culverts B and C. I quote from his Flood Assessment Report:
The main reason for the flood was [the] failed slope at a bank of the unlined drain. The earth fill material blocked the flow of water in the unlined drain, causing backwater to propagate upstream and eventually flood [the] armoury of the [SRA].
Professor Babovic observed that the slopes of the unlined drain were steep and constructed using non-compacted material which was not secure. He also opined that, based on the SRA’s account of earth fill material being dumped at the Premises, the dumping of earth fill material has “undoubtedly altered local surface hydrology, resulting in altered runoff processes”. However, Professor Babovic did not draw a conclusive link between these altered runoff processes and the 1st Flood, concluding only that the “changes in local drainage properties due to earth fill works should have been assessed before the commencement of the works, since they may lead to an increase in flooding risks”.
31     Professor Tan studied the landslip (which he termed a “soil slip”) that had occurred between Culverts B and C, resulting in soil blocking the water flow in the unlined drain. In his opinion, the soil slip occurred because the slope along the sides of the unlined drain was too steep and the strengths of the soil had reduced over time. He also concluded that the slopes of the unlined drain had been constructed using soils which were unsuitable for embankment fills. Three out of four bags of sample soil from the slopes of the unlined drain did not meet the specifications for suitable embankment fill materials. I am however sceptical about the evidence of his assessment that the slopes were inadequately maintained as they were lacking in grass cover. The photographs from which he drew this conclusion were taken by Professor Babovic 
after
 the 1st Flood, and were therefore not indicative of the state of the grass cover prior to the 1st Flood. Nonetheless, apart from the issue of maintenance, Professor Tan was of the view that the construction of the slopes of the unlined drain did not comply with the PUB Code.
32     Although the cause of the floods took centre stage in this suit, there was ultimately little dispute between the parties about it. The SRA canvassed various contributing technical causes of the 1st Flood – that the dumping of earth fill material caused an altered surface hydrology that resulted in altered run off processes; that the crossings at Culverts A and C were unauthorised by the PUB and impeded water flow. In closing submissions, both parties were of the same view that the main cause of the 1st Flood was a landslip caused by the slope failure between Culverts B and C. I accepted Professor Babovic’s evidence that this was the main cause, as well as Professor Tan’s evidence that the unlined drain was constructed using unsuitable soil and the slope failed because it was too steep and the strengths of the soil reduced over time.
Breach of duty in respect of the 1st Flood
33     The SSA’s duty is to exercise reasonable care to see that the Premises are reasonably safe and do not cause injury to persons and property on the Premises (see 
See Toh
 at [57]). At [15] above, I set out the breaches pleaded by the SRA in detail. In essence, the alleged breaches consisted of an alleged failure to properly construct the unlined drain and a more general failure to maintain and supervise the Premises. Given the evidence that the main cause was the failed slope between Culverts B and C, my focus was on any breaches by the SSA in the construction and maintenance of the slopes or embankment of the unlined drain.
Construction of the new embankment
34     It was common ground that the failed slope between Culverts B and C formed part of an embankment along the unlined drain that was newly constructed during the period of Sport Singapore’s renovation works for the SEA Games. The embankment did not exist prior to the time of the renovation works. This was accepted by the SSA’s Mr Michael Vaz, the SRA’s Mr Chung as well as the BOI (based apparently on information from the SSA’s personnel) in its report. Both of the SRA’s experts also observed that the embankment along the unlined drain was relatively newly constructed.
35     Although much emphasis was placed by the SRA on the rampant dumping of earth fill material on the Premises, I was of the view that the state of the newly constructed embankment along the unlined drain could not have come about as a result of indiscriminate dumping of earth fill material. The photographs of the embankment showed slopes that were deliberately cut and spruced with grass cover. In any event, since the SSA and Sport Singapore each disclaimed responsibility for the dump trucks, there was no convincing evidence as to who had engaged the dump trucks, for what purpose, and whether the dumping was carried out specifically to fill the embankment. It was mere conjecture by the SRA’s personnel that the SSA had received payment for allowing dump trucks to unload material at the Premises.
36     As I outlined at [17] above, the SSA denied that it had breached its duty of care on the basis that it had handed over control of the Premises to Sport Singapore and was entitled to assume that Sport Singapore would ensure that the construction was properly done. On the other hand, the SRA asserted that Sport Singapore did not authorise any works beyond Culvert B. In their submission, it followed that the SSA retained control and supervision over the embankment where the landslip occurred, and hence, the SSA was responsible for the poor structural integrity and soil quality of the slope which failed.
37     The issue of breach in relation to the construction of the new embankment therefore turned on whether and to what extent the SSA had control and oversight over the construction of the embankment between Culverts B and C. Another way of framing the issue is whether and to what extent Sport Singapore, instead of the SSA, was in control of the works done on the embankment between Culverts B and C.
38     The SRA subpoenaed Mr Pattiselanno from Sport Singapore. In a letter responding to the SRA’s queries dated 23 January 2017, Sport Singapore claimed that it had not requested the SSA to surrender the whole of the Premises to it for the SEA Games renovation. It stated that it had conducted works relating to an unlined drain only at the area between the 25m and 50m ranges. Culverts A to C were situated along a different stream from the unlined drain described in the letter. To be clear, the scope of works described in Sport Singapore’s letter did not include the unlined drain between Culverts B and C. During the trial, when presented with two chains of emails marked “P2” and “P3”, Mr Pattiselanno agreed that the works on the Premises were not confined to the area between the 25m and 50m ranges but went beyond, as “consequential work was required at the main drain” (
ie
, the unlined drain where Culverts A to C were situated). However, Mr Pattiselanno only agreed that Sport Singapore in fact “carried out backfilling works along the unlined earth drain at least up to culvert B”. Mr Pattiselanno also agreed that the works were not restricted to backfilling but involved upgrading works, whereby the embankment was re-constructed. He conceded that the initial response in its letter was inaccurate since the area handed back to the SSA on 1 December 2014 also included the unlined drain at least up to Culvert B, since works had been done there.
39     Nonetheless, Mr Pattiselanno maintained that Sport Singapore did not authorise the construction of the embankment between Culverts B and C where the landslip occurred. He clarified that Sport Singapore did not engage or authorise any contractor to do any works 
beyond
 Culvert B. Therefore, if the embankment was indeed built by the contractor engaged by Sport Singapore, it was apparently done without the authority or instructions of Sport Singapore. Mr Pattiselanno had no personal knowledge of the works but based his evidence on an email chain marked “P2” between Sport Singapore and its contractor. To indicate where the consequential backfilling works were required to be done, the contractor had highlighted on a map the unlined drain only up to Culvert B. This was accompanied by a cross-sectional diagram of the profile of the unlined drain after the proposed embankment works. Mr Pattiselanno had no personal knowledge as to whether works beyond Culvert B were in fact carried out by this contractor or any other contractor. No invoices, contracts or variation orders were produced to substantiate whether Sport Singapore’s contractor had in fact carried out works between Culverts B and C. However, Mr Vaz gave unchallenged evidence that there was only one contractor on site.
40     I accepted that the SSA did not authorise, propose or contract for the construction of any new water drainage infrastructure in the period leading up to the 1st Flood, including the works on the embankment between Culverts B and C. In fact, I noted that pursuant to cl 5.12 of the lease agreement between the SSA and Sport Singapore, the SSA had to prepare plans and specifications and obtain the requisite planning and other consents when proposing alteration works for Sport Singapore’s approval. The SSA could not have carried out any alteration works to the Premises without the prior written consent of Sport Singapore.
41     Additionally, it appeared that Sport Singapore was itself operating on the understanding that it had authority or permission to carry out or extend works to any part of the Premises as was necessary during the period when it had control over the Premises for the SEA Games renovation (
ie
, between October 2013 and December 2014). Although Sport Singapore claimed to have taken over control only of areas where renovation works were planned, when consequential works were required at the unlined drain – which included areas where no works were initially planned – Sport Singapore authorised the contractor to commence these extended works in January 2014 without first seeking the views or permission of the SSA. It seemed to me that the scope and quality of any works done to the water drainage infrastructure came under the direct responsibility of Sport Singapore which had engaged the contractor and was in direct communication with the contractor. Professor Babovic advised the SRA as follows in a memo adduced as evidence:
… one cannot upgrade only one part of the drain and ignore the other sections … The drain needs to be looked at as one integrated piece of infrastructure. … By implication, if one wishes to upgrade the drain, he/she must upgrade the entire drain to make sure that the changes meet [the PUB Code] requirements.
42     I clarify that I made no findings on Sport Singapore’s conduct or liability, because this suit only concerned the SSA’s liability. But regardless of whether the upgrading of the embankment between Culverts B and C was in fact authorised by Sport Singapore, the SSA did not have immediate oversight over any construction of or improvements to the water drainage infrastructure in the period leading up to the 1st Flood. It was reasonable for the SSA to rely on Sport Singapore to ensure that the water drainage infrastructure was designed and constructed in accordance with all regulations and with the proper advice of qualified persons, and that all alterations to the Premises were structurally safe and adequate. This reliance is similar to that in 
See Toh
 where HAL and Lal Offshore were entitled to believe that the highly experienced operator of the Mooring Operation would have taken all necessary precautions during the Mooring Operation to avoid danger to those present at and near the Operations Site (at [106]). Therefore, I was of the view that the SSA did not breach any duty in relation to the poor construction of the slopes and the failure to comply with the PUB Code.
Maintenance and checks after Premises were handed back to the SSA
43     Nonetheless, it did not follow that the SSA’s duty of care to the SRA was necessarily discharged. I was prepared to go further to consider the SSA’s duty to maintain the Premises, including the unlined drain, after it had regained control of the Premises on 1 December 2014. As the lessee and occupier, the SSA was responsible for taking reasonable steps to ensure that the Premises remained safe after the renovation works. The SSA occupied the Premises after the completion of the works. It knew that the SRA remained on the Premises and would continue to do so after the completion of the works. The SSA could therefore be expected to have made reasonable inquiries to satisfy itself of the scope and soundness of the works that Sport Singapore had carried out on the Premises. At the time that the renovation works were completed, the SSA could be expected to have checked that the works had been completed to a satisfactory standard and that no unauthorised work had been undertaken during the renovation period. This was the extent of its duty, as the occupier, to monitor and supervise the condition of the Premises arising from the alterations to the land effected by its landlord.
44     I would hasten to add that this did not necessarily mean that the SSA had to personally test the site and hire professionals to offer their opinions on the state of the land. Given that the works had been proposed and commissioned by Sport Singapore, who was the SSA’s landlord, I accepted that it would have been reasonable for the SSA to rely on the representations or assurances by Sport Singapore that the works did not affect the structural integrity and drainage effectiveness of the Premises.
45     In the present case, however, there was no evidence showing that the SSA had inquired about or ascertained the scope of works that had been carried out on the Premises (including the drainage works), or the impact of those works on the land and its drainage effectiveness. Mr Vaz testified that when he noticed the newly constructed embankment, he was satisfied that it was aesthetically pleasing but made no effort to ask who was responsible for it and whether it was structurally sound and compliant with regulations. It appeared from the email chain marked as “P3” that the SSA questioned the contractor about the impact of the embankment works on the drainage system only when a member of the Singapore Gun Club (another member club of the SSA and a lawful user of the Premises) asked about whether the backfilling works would choke a specific pipe servicing the upper skeet and trap drainage pipes. Even then, it seemed that the SSA’s clarification extended only to the impact of the backfilling work on those specific pipes and not about the soundness of the backfilling and upgrading of the embankment at the unlined drain.
46     It seemed to me that the SSA was content to simply recover control of the Premises after the works were completed without conducting any checks on the quality of the works that had been carried out. The SSA showed a disregard for the alterations to the Premises, the condition of the Premises, and what the alterations meant for the SSA’s maintenance of the Premises in the future. The SSA had noticed that works were being done on the unlined drains (at least between Culverts A and B). But there was no evidence that the SSA had asked Sport Singapore if the necessary approvals from the PUB had been obtained for those works. I noted that on 13 December 2014, the SSA’s General Manager, Mr David Lieu, asked Sport Singapore about any follow-up actions after the contractor handed over the Premises to Sport Singapore on 1 December 2014, so as to plan his daily management of the facilities. He also asked about the schedule of any maintenance work and the arrangement between Sport Singapore and the SSA in that regard. This was the only indication that the SSA had showed concern about the impact of the alterations on its maintenance. However, none of the follow-up actions listed by the contractor in its handover form concerned the drainage facilities, and the SSA could have inquired earlier about the scope of the drainage works. Sport Singapore acknowledged Mr Lieu’s email on 22 December 2014 but did not furnish a substantive reply.
47     I found that by failing to inquire and conduct checks on the Premises’ drainage capabilities after the works on the unlined drain, the SSA had breached its duty to maintain and supervise the condition of the Premises.
Causation in respect of the 1st Flood
48     To succeed in its counterclaim, the SRA must show not only a breach of duty, but also that the breach caused its alleged loss. The SRA’s loss must not have been one that would have occurred anyway in the absence of the SSA’s breach. The test for causation in the tort of negligence is the “but for” test. The question here was whether, but for the SSA’s negligence, the 1st Flood would still have occurred. In other words, even if the SSA had exercised reasonable care in inquiring and checking on the drainage infrastructure after the alteration works, could it have discovered its inadequacies and made the necessary rectifications by the time of the 1st Flood? This was to be satisfied on a balance of probabilities.
49     On a balance of probabilities, I found that it had not been proved that if the SSA had exercised reasonable care, it would have prevented the 1st Flood from occurring due to the landslip. In drawing the causal link, it is crucial to bear in mind the nature of the SSA’s breach. As explained before, the SSA’s breach of duty consisted of its failure to make reasonable inquiries and checks on the state of the Premises when the renovation works were completed and, where necessary, make rectifications to ensure the safety of the Premises’ condition. Mr Vaz accepted that there was sufficient time and opportunity between 1 December 2014 and the time of the 1st Flood to inspect the grounds and raise any concerns. He conceded that the SSA’s facilities manager “should have checked” the grounds in that time. If indeed the works at the embankment between Culverts B and C had not been authorised by Sport Singapore or the SSA (see [39] above), Sport Singapore might have clarified so if the SSA had made reasonable inquiries and checks on the scope of the works done. If so, this would have alerted the SSA to the need to make further investigations into, for example, who constructed the new embankment, why it was constructed, as well as the fitness of its design, structure and materials. This may have involved investigations to determine the structural integrity of the embankment.
50     However, it was not shown that if these steps had been taken by the SSA, the 1st Flood would not have occurred. The SRA’s evidence focused on the inadequacies in how the slope was constructed (namely using unsuitable soil) and the failure to engage qualified persons and procure approvals in the construction process; however, for the reasons explained at [40]–[43] above, the SSA had no direct oversight over the construction of the water drainage infrastructure. There was no suggestion before me as to the types of checks that the SRA expected the SSA to have conducted as part of its regular maintenance (as opposed to during the process of construction) or its reasonable inspection after the renovation works. It was not proved that such checks, if conducted, would have detected the poor structural integrity of the embankment and its propensity to erode and obstruct the drain. Given that it was common ground that the embankment was newly constructed, there was also no evidence that the 24-day period between 1 December 2014 and the 1st Flood would have provided sufficient time for the SSA to raise inquiries, appoint drainage management and soil erosion consultants, and complete the requisite rectification works.
51     In other words, even if the SSA had exercised reasonable care to make inquiries, raise concerns and start investigations and rectifications after it regained control of the Premises, the rectification works between Culverts B and C (or on the whole unlined drain) would likely have taken some time. Perhaps, had the 1st Flood occurred much later, the SRA might have been better able to show that the SSA could have made the checks and rectification works in time to prevent such a flood.
52     I therefore found that the SSA’s breach of its duty to maintain and supervise the Premises in the particular manner I have outlined could not be said to have caused the 1st Flood. I held that the SSA was not liable to the SRA for the alleged losses arising from the 1st Flood.
The 2nd Flood
53     I turn to the 2nd Flood. The SRA submitted that the 2nd Flood occurred because Culvert B had been choked by debris. This was supported by Professor Babovic’s addendum report. Professor Babovic assessed that the rainfall event on 3 May 2015 was, like the rainfall event on 24 December 2014, an event that would occur approximately once in two years, which was well within the drainage capacity expected of the Premises. He found that the main reason for the 2nd Flood was the blockage of a pipe at Culvert B connecting the two sections of the drain. This led to backwater flooding upstream. A failed slope was also observed at a similar location as before, between Culverts B and C, but the debris at Culvert B was assessed to be the main contributing factor. The state of the Premises at the time of the 2nd Flood reinforced Professor Babovic’s view that the drainage system had been inadequately designed and constructed. Professor Tan did not offer an opinion on the cause of the 2nd Flood.
54     After the 2nd Flood, the PUB conducted site investigations and found that the undersized culverts were badly choked with debris and that there was an extended stretch of landslide into the unlined drain between Culverts B and C. In the PUB’s view, these were the main causes of the flooding. The landslide was in turn caused by poor slope stabilisation work and poor reinstatement works to the slope.
55     The SSA argued that the SRA had failed to prove the cause of the 2nd Flood but did not proffer an alternative suggestion as to what may have caused it. The only attack on Professor Babovic’s expert opinion was that he had relied on photographs not personally taken by him to arrive at his conclusion. The SSA also pointed out Mr Kung’s contrary view that it was a landslide into the unlined drain that caused the 2nd Flood.
56     I accepted Professor Babovic’s evidence that the main cause was the clogging of Culvert B by debris, although the landslide that could be seen further downstream may also have been a contributing factor.
57     In my view, the SSA breached its duty of care by failing to maintain the Premises and to undertake adequate rectification or precautionary measures to avoid another flood, despite being alert to the inadequacy of the drainage infrastructure. By 3 May 2015, it was clear that the SSA was in control of the Premises. By 24 February 2015, the SSA had been furnished Professor Babovic’s expert opinion, which raised issues about the unsafe design and construction of the drainage system at the Premises. The SSA would also have been made aware of the propensity of the unlined drain to be washed down with debris. It had also been notified by Sport Singapore of the PUB’s concerns about the undersized culverts and the need to carry out frequent maintenance to ensure that the inert water level was regular. It was a clear failure of maintenance that led to the clogging of the unlined drain with debris. Mr Vaz conceded during the trial that the SSA was responsible for the upkeep of the premises including dealing with the clogging of the unlined drain:
Q:
What was, to the best of your knowledge, the reason for the second flood on 3 May 2015?
A:
The clogging of culvert A.
…
Q:
Who is responsible for culvert A?
A:
At that point in time it was probably SSA.
…
Q:
So by your case, it’s the clogging of the drain, right? Who was responsible for the upkeep of the clogging of the drain?
A:
Probably SSA.
58     This was a failure to take reasonable care in its maintenance of the Premises, which directly caused loss to the SRA because the 2nd Flood was mainly caused by the clogging of Culvert B. Even if the landslide had contributed to the 2nd Flood, the SSA’s duty of care at that time extended to addressing the poor soil stabilisation between the time of the 1st Flood and the 2nd Flood. This was because, after the 1st Flood, the SSA was aware that there were issues with the water drainage infrastructure and that rectification works were necessary to ensure that a flood did not occur again.
59     Therefore, I found the SSA liable to the SRA for losses of $4,708 expended on cleaning works after the 2nd Flood.
Costs
60     The SSA submitted that it was entitled to costs because it had succeeded in defending the main claim in respect of the 1st Flood. The SRA had claimed $454,678.28 in damages for the 1st Flood but only $4,708 in damages for the 2nd Flood.
61     On the other hand, the SRA submitted that it was entitled to costs (including all disbursements incurred for procuring the two experts) because it had obtained judgment against the SSA and succeeded on the issues of duty and breach in respect of the 1st Flood. The SRA relied on 
Tullio Planeta v Maoro Andrea G
 
[1994] 2 SLR(R) 501
 (“
Tullio
”) and the issue-based approach discussed in 
Khng Thian Huat and another v Riduan bin Yusof and another
 
[2005] 1 SLR(R) 130
 (“
Khng Thian Huat
”). The SRA submitted that it had incurred necessary time and expense in establishing the SSA’s duty and breach as well as in calling expert evidence to establish the cause of both floods. It also claimed that the SSA did not succeed on any of its pleaded defences. Thus it urged the court not to split costs between the two floods on a “technical win-loss comparison”.
62     I awarded costs to the SSA fixed at $85,600 plus reasonable disbursements. I applied a daily tariff of $16,000 with 100% applied for the first five days of trial and 80% for the remaining two days of trial. I then deducted one day’s tariff to take into account the award to the SRA in respect of the 2nd Flood and for the SRA’s leading expert evidence on the cause of the 1st Flood, which the SSA initially disputed but later conceded in submissions. A further $4,000 was deducted for costs incurred by the SRA in dealing with the SSA’s dispute over the authenticity of certain invoices.
63     In making this costs order, I considered that the SSA had succeeded in defending the SRA’s main and largest claim in respect of the 1st Flood while the SRA had succeeded in its claim in respect of the 2nd Flood which was much smaller in quantum. An appropriate costs award should reflect any split outcome. Further, the trial centred on the evidence relating to the 1st Flood.
64     In 
Khng Thian Huat
, the court considered an issue-based approach, being one where the judge considers “issue by issue … where the costs on each distinct or discrete issue should fall … [and] which party has been successful on that issue” (at [19], citing 
Summit Property Ltd v Pitmans
 [2001] EWCA Civ 2020 at [27]). An issue-based approach should only be adopted in an exceptional or unusual case, 
eg
, where there is no clear demarcation as to which party had been successful on an overall basis (
Khng Thian Huat
 at [21]). In my view, the SRA’s submissions were premised on an erroneous understanding of the issue-based approach. According to the principles applied in both 
Tullio
 and 
Khng Thian Huat
, the successful party to whom costs are awarded is the party who has succeeded in the 
cause of action
. Even where an issue-based approach is adopted, the issues refer to the separate claims for relief and 
not discrete elements
 of a cause of action such as duty or breach. That I found the elements of duty and breach in the SRA’s favour in respect of the 1st Flood did not provide a basis for the SRA to be awarded costs overall.
65     Moreover, I did 
not
 find that the SSA had breached its duty in the manner argued by the SRA. In fact, I agreed with the SSA that the SSA was not responsible for the proper construction of the unlined drain when the renovation works were being carried out by Sport Singapore. I went further to find that the SSA did act negligently in failing to properly maintain and supervise the Premises after the Premises were returned to it, but in any case the breach of duty as I found it did not cause the 1st Flood.
66     In 
Tullio
, the Court of Appeal held that costs always follow the event unless there are special reasons for depriving the successful litigant of his costs in part or in full (at [21]). This general rule does not cease to apply simply because the successful party raised issues or made allegations that failed (at [24]). However, a successful party may not only be deprived of costs but may also be ordered to pay the whole or part of the unsuccessful party’s costs where he raised issues or made allegations improperly or unreasonably (at [24]). Considering that the SSA succeeded on the 1st Flood, it could not be said that the SRA was the successful party even though it obtained judgment. As the successful party, the SSA should not be deprived of its costs simply because it had run arguments that failed on certain issues. It did not act unreasonably in running its defences. However, I noted that the SSA initially disputed the expert evidence that a landslip arising from a slope failure was the cause of the 1st Flood and conceded the position only in its closing submissions. I therefore reduced its costs award to reflect the time and work unnecessarily expended by the SRA as a result of the SSA’s contesting the expert evidence.
Conclusion
67     In conclusion, my orders were as follows:
(a)     The SRA’s claim in respect of the 1st Flood is dismissed;
(b)     The SSA is liable to the SRA for losses of $4,708 expended on cleaning works for the 2nd Flood; and
(c)     The SRA shall pay to the SSA costs fixed at $85,600 plus reasonable disbursements.

Introduction
1       This judgment is issued as a supplement to an earlier decision of this Court dated 6 August 2015 in 
Yeo Boong Hua and others v Turf Club Auto Emporium Pte Ltd and others
 
[2015] SGHC 207
 (“the HC Judgment”). The HC Judgment concerned the setting aside of the Consent Order entered into by the parties in settlement of then-ongoing litigation (
ie
, the Consolidated Suits), and the consequences arising therefrom should that order be set aside. I held that the Consent Order should be set aside on grounds of the Defendants’ repudiatory breaches of that order, and that the Consolidated Suits should therefore be reinstated.
2       On 22 March 2017, the Court of Appeal in 
Turf Club Auto Emporium Pte Ltd and others v Yeo Boong Hua and others and another appeal and other matters
 
[2017] 2 SLR 12
 (“the CA Judgment”) agreed with my findings on the repudiatory breaches. However, in relation to the remedies that should flow from those breaches, the Court of Appeal held that there was no basis for the Consent Order to be set aside or for the Consolidated Suits to be reinstated. The Court of Appeal requested further submissions on the consequential issues arising from the findings in the CA Judgment.
3       On 15 August 2017, the Court of Appeal heard the parties on their further submissions and reserved judgment. By a letter through the Registry dated 24 August 2017, the Court of Appeal directed that the Plaintiffs’ claims in the torts of conspiracy and inducement of breach of contract were to be concurrently remitted to this Court for determination. These claims were pleaded and advanced in the Consolidated Suits, and in the HC Judgment I left them to be dealt with as part of the reinstated Consolidated Suits. I now consider these claims on the merits.
Background
4       The background facts leading to this supplementary judgment were set out in the HC Judgment after a trial of the action (at [5]–[56]) and in the CA Judgment (at [4]–[50]). I do not propose to repeat them except where necessary or desirable to provide easier understanding or context. I will also adopt the same descriptions and definitions as were used in the HC Judgment.
The Joint Venture 
5       The Plaintiffs and the SAA Group represent two business groups in the Joint Venture. The Plaintiffs are the three individuals in the first group, and the latter SAA Group comprises five individual Defendants (
ie
, Roger Koh, Tan Senior, Samuel Ng, Tan CB, and Ong CK). The Joint Venture concerned the development and operation of the Site, which was a large plot of land (roughly 557,000m
2
) located in Bukit Timah, Singapore.
6       In January 2001, the SLA, which was then known as the Singapore Land Office, invited tenders for the lease of the Site. The Tender Notice put up by the SLA indicated that the lease was to commence from 1 September 2001 and the tenure was described as “3+3+3 years”, which referred to a term of three years with an option to renew for a three year term plus a further option for the third tranche of a three year term. By the time the tender closed on 2 March 2001, SLA had received only two bids. One was submitted by the Plaintiffs through their corporate vehicle, BTC; the other was submitted by the SAA Group through their corporate vehicle, SAA.
7       The Plaintiffs and the SAA Group came to know that the other group had placed or was planning to place a bid for the Site. Thereafter, a consensus was reached between the two groups that they would enter into the Joint Venture to develop and operate the Site regardless of which group would win the tender. While there was some dispute as to whether the two groups had had a discussion about the Joint Venture on 2 March 2001, just before the their respective bids were submitted that same day, there was no dispute that the MOU to develop and operate the Site was signed on 8 March 2001 by the Eight Individuals who comprise the Plaintiffs and the SAA Group. The MOU envisaged that a Joint Venture company, 
ie
, the New Company, would be incorporated to develop and operate the Site, and that the Plaintiffs and the SAA Group would hold 37.5% and 62.5% of the shares in the New Company respectively.
8       Eventually, instead of one company, two new companies were incorporated (
ie
, TCAE and TCPL, which collectively comprise the JV Companies) to develop and operate the Site. The business model for the Project was to use part of the Site as a used car centre and another part as a shopping mall. The plan was for the successful bidder, which turned out to be SAA, to grant a sub-tenancy to each of the JV Companies on identical terms as the head lease between the SLA and SAA. Each of the JV Companies would then rent or license out individual lots or units to the ultimate sub-tenants.
9       I set out in Annex A a table of relevant persons and their directorships and shareholdings in the various companies. In this regard, I note that there is an inaccuracy in the HC Judgment, where it is stated (at [22]) that “[o]n 25 June 2001, the Eight Individuals [defined as the Plaintiffs and the SAA Group collectively]
[note: 1]
 were appointed as directors of TCPL.” Rather, it would appear that Tan Senior and Ong CK had been directors of TCPL from 12 May 2001,
[note: 2]
 and that on 25 June 2001, only 6 and not 8 persons were approved as directors of TCPL (
ie
, Roger Koh, Samuel Ng, Tan CB, and the Plaintiffs).
[note: 3]
 Nothing in the HC Judgment is affected by this discrepancy.
10     On 10 July 2001, the SLA granted the first tranche of the head lease, 
ie
, the 2001 Head Lease, to SAA for three years starting from 1 September 2001. On the same day, SAA in turn entered into the first sub-tenancies, 
ie
, the 2001 STAs, with each of the JV Companies for a period of three years less one day.
Disputes and the Consent Order
11     Unfortunately, disputes then arose between the Plaintiffs and the SAA Group in relation to the Joint Venture. These disputes culminated in two actions commenced by the Plaintiffs, 
ie
, OS 1634/02 and S 703/04, against various individuals and corporate entities. The two actions were consolidated on 28 January 2005 and were referred to as the “Consolidated Suits” in the HC Judgment.
12     While the court proceedings in the Consolidated Suits were pending, two sets of events occurred:
(a)     The 2001 Head Lease and the 2001 STAs expired. On 10 September 2004, the SLA granted a second tranche of a three years lease to SAA in respect of the Site, 
ie
, the 2004 Head Lease. On the same day, SAA granted the second tranche of the sub-tenancies, 
ie
, the 2004 STAs, to each of the JV Companies for a period of three years less one day.
(b)     Samuel Ng, Tan Senior, and Ong CK were adjudged bankrupts on 25 April 2003, 29 August 2003, and 5 March 2004 respectively. As a result of their bankruptcy, the three individuals could no longer hold directorships in the JV Companies. Tan CB and Roger Koh were the ones formally in charge of operations from 2004 onwards.
13     On 22 February 2006, the Consent Order was entered into. The Plaintiffs and some of the Defendants were named parties to the Consent Order, but not Tan CB and Ong CK. As for Tan Senior, it was disputed whether he was a party to the Consent Order and whether he had been represented by Tan CB at the hearing at which the Consent Order was recorded (see CA Judgment at [28]).
14     I have set out the aim and the mechanism originally envisaged under the Consent Order in [30] to [34] of the HC Judgment. Broadly speaking, the Consent Order envisaged (a) an investigation into the Plaintiffs’ allegations regarding the financial affairs of the JV Companies, (b) a valuation of the JV Companies, and (c) a closed bidding exercise, at the end of which the higher bidder would purchase the shares of the lower bidder in the JV Companies and representatives of the lower bidder would also resign from directorship positions in the JV Companies. The Joint Venture would therefore come to an end.
15     To give effect to the above, the Consent Order envisaged that the KPMG entities designated to conduct the investigation and valuation would submit the Valuation Report in relation to the JV Companies to the parties to the Consent Order by 2 July 2006, and that the bidding exercise would be carried out within 28 days thereafter. However, the Valuation Report was eventually issued on 10 August 2007, more than 13 months after the envisaged deadline.
The present action 
16     Importantly, on 8 September 2006, while the Valuation Report was pending, SAA obtained in-principle approval for the renewal of the 2004 Head Lease for the third tranche. The formal agreement with the SLA for this third tranche, 
ie
, the 2007 Head Lease, was signed on 22 May 2007. However, this time round, SAA did not grant any sub-tenancy to either of the JV Companies.
17     In the circumstances, the Plaintiffs commenced the present suit against the Defendants to set aside the Consent Order on grounds of repudiatory breach, frustration, and mistake. In particular, the Plaintiffs claimed that the non-renewal of the sub-tenancies constituted repudiatory breaches of the Consent Order. I found in their favour (see HC Judgment at [121]–[178], [227(a)]), and the Court of Appeal agreed with this finding (see CA Judgment at [112]–[148]).
18     However, while I had set aside the Consent Order and allowed the reinstatement of the Consolidated Suits as a consequence of the repudiatory breaches (see HC Judgment at [210], [227(d)]), the Court of Appeal held that the Consent Order could not be set aside 
ab initio
 and that the Consolidated Suits could not be reinstated by the Plaintiffs (see CA Judgment at [149]–[173]).
19     On invitation of the Court of Appeal, the parties subsequently addressed the Court of Appeal on 15 August 2017 regarding the remedies that should flow from the Defendants’ repudiatory breaches of the Consent Order (see CA Judgment at [174]–[175]). Thereafter, the Court of Appeal gave directions for certain claims to be remitted to the trial judge. The directions were set out in a letter from the Registrar of the Supreme Court dated 24 August 2017. It stated that the Plaintiffs’ claims in the torts of conspiracy and inducement of breach of contract were to be remitted to the trial judge for determination. In the HC Judgment, I did not make any findings in respect of these two claims as I was of the view that these claims would be subsumed under the Consolidated Suits which were to be reinstated (see HC Judgment at [228]). However, as the Court of Appeal decided that the Consolidated Suits could not be reinstated, these claims have to be addressed by me, and I do so in the present supplementary judgment.
20     Specifically, the Court of Appeal’s directions to this Court sought my determination of whether some of the Defendants, in particular, the Defendants who were not parties to the Consent Order, namely, Tan CB, Ong CK, and Tan Senior (who was arguably not a party to the Consent Order), are liable for:
(a)     the tort of conspiracy (either by unlawful means or to injure) to cause or procure the contractual breaches as pleaded at para 67 of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2) (“the SOC”); and/or
(b)     the tort of inducing the breaches of contract as pleaded at para 68 of the SOC.
21     The Court of Appeal clarified that the question is whether the Defendants in the present action, in particular, Tan CB, Ong CK, and/or Tan Senior, had conspired to procure and/or had induced the breaches of the Consent Order by the other relevant Defendants. Further, I am not required to consider or find whether any of the Defendants in the present action owed or breached any fiduciary duties under the Joint Venture, under the Consent Order, or on any other basis. I am also not required to consider whether the Plaintiffs’ claims had been adequately pleaded in the SOC.
22     The Court of Appeal directed that the Plaintiffs’ claims are to be decided without any further evidence being adduced by the parties, but left it to me to decide whether further submissions on any particular point should be made.
23     On 28 August 2017, I gave directions for further submissions on the law pertaining to conspiracy and inducement of breach of contract. Further submissions have been received.
The decision
Tort of conspiracy to injure by unlawful means
24     Generally, to establish a claim on conspiracy by unlawful means, the plaintiff must show the following (
EFT Holdings, Inc and another v Marinteknik Shipbuilders (S) Pte Ltd and another
 
[2014] 1 SLR 860
 (“
EFT Holdings
”) at [112]):
(a)     there was a combination of two or more persons to do certain acts;
(b)     the alleged conspirators had the intention to cause damage or injury to the plaintiff by those acts;
(c)     the acts were unlawful;
(d)     the acts were performed in furtherance of the agreement; and
(e)     the plaintiff suffered loss as a result of the conspiracy.
25     In respect of element (a), I note that conspiracy or combination may often, in the absence of direct evidence, be inferred from the circumstances: “[i]t is not often that the victim of a conspiracy will be able to obtain direct evidence to prove the allegation. Proof of conspiracy is normally to be inferred from other objective facts.” (
Asian Corporate Services (SEA) Pte Ltd v Eastwest Management Ltd (Singapore Branch)
 
[2006] 1 SLR(R) 901
 at [19]; 
The Dolphina
 
[2012] 1 SLR 992
 (“
The Dolphina
”) at [262]). Furthermore, since proof of a combination is usually not forthcoming, the unlawful acts being performed are often sufficient to justify the inference that their commission was the product of concert between the alleged conspirators (
The Dolphina
 at [264]).
26     In the present case, element (e) is not in dispute. In respect of the other elements, these will be discussed in the context of the role and participation of each of the relevant Defendants (
ie
, Tan CB, Roger Koh, Tan Senior, and Ong CK), which I will examine in turn.
27     Before I do so, I make one observation about SAA. In view of my findings as the trial judge, which were accepted by the Court of Appeal, it can no longer be disputed that SAA is one of the Defendants who had breached the Consent Order. Under the Consent Order, if the 2007 Head Lease was granted by the SLA to SAA (as had turned out to be the case), SAA would be obliged to grant sub-tenancies to each of the JV Companies in respect of the third three year tranche of the 2007 Head Lease. In short, it was envisaged under the Consent Order that the JV Companies would have the benefit of such sub-tenancies. Accordingly, by refusing to grant the sub-tenancies to the JV Companies, SAA had misappropriated the benefit of the 2007 Head Lease, undermined the Consent Order, and caused the Plaintiffs to suffer loss.
Tan CB
28     Since SAA is a corporate entity, it must have acted through natural persons as its officers or representatives.
29     One of these officers or representatives at the material time was Tan CB. He was a director of SAA both before and after the Consent Order was made (see Annex A).
[note: 4]
 It was not in dispute that Tan CB was the one who had, in his own words, “decided” that SAA would not grant the sub-tenancies in question to the JV Companies, despite SAA itself having been granted the 2007 Head Lease by the SLA.
[note: 5]
 Tan CB’s main defence was that there was no obligation under the Consent Order for SAA to grant these sub-tenancies to the JV Companies. In other words, there was no prohibition on SAA’s appropriation of the whole of the benefits of the 2007 Head Lease to itself. However, as stated above (at [17]), the Courts have found to the contrary.
30     I add that this was not a case of an innocent breach of the Consent Order. Any suggestion that Tan CB had genuinely believed that SAA was not obliged to grant the sub-tenancies, and/or that he had genuinely sought and relied on legal advice to that effect,
[note: 6]
 must be rejected. As the Court of Appeal observed, the parties would have responded “Oh, of course!” if the officious bystander had asked them at the time the Consent Order was entered into whether SAA should be prohibited from appropriating the benefit of the 2007 Head Lease pending the performance of the Consent Order, should the 2004 Head Lease expire before then (see CA Judgment at [138]). Furthermore, as I explained in the HC Judgment (at [151]), Tan CB’s claim that he had embarked on this course of conduct out of concern about the impact of a possible liquidation of the JV Companies on the ultimate sub-tenants appears to be a sham. Therefore, it was and remains clear that Tan CB must have known at all material times that if the sub-tenancies were not granted for the third tranche, this would undermine the bidding process for the JV Companies envisaged by the Consent Order and cause injury to the Plaintiffs.
31     Even though knowledge of a probable or certain outcome does not necessarily mean that there is intention to cause that outcome, the requisite intention can nevertheless be inferred from such knowledge (
EFT Holdings
 at [101]). Indeed, it is clear on the facts that Tan CB’s intention was to cause injury to the Plaintiffs. Notwithstanding Tan CB’s knowledge that the business and value of the JV Companies would be undermined by his decision for SAA not to grant the third tranche of the sub-tenancies to the JV Companies, he continued with the pretence that the valuation and the bidding of the JV Companies would proceed as envisaged under the Consent Order, without informing the Plaintiffs of his intention to deprive the JV Companies of the sub-tenancies for the third tranche. This meant that the Plaintiffs would most likely overbid for the SAA Group’s shares in the JV Companies, which were in truth bereft of value. Even if the Plaintiffs had realised in time that SAA would not grant the sub-tenancies to the JV Companies, they would nevertheless be deprived of the opportunity to participate in the business of the JV Companies since there would be little purpose in them submitting a bid when the existing 2004 STAs were coming to an end. Furthermore, the SAA Group would also in all likelihood not be making any meaningful bid for the Plaintiffs’ shares in the JV Companies, if at all. In the circumstances, the irresistible inference from Tan CB’s conduct was that he intended to injure the Plaintiffs in a targeted manner either by causing them (a) to overbid for the JV Companies’ shares held by the SAA Group, or (b) to be deprived of the opportunity to continue participating in the development and operation of the Site, and to be unable to obtain fair value for their shares in the JV Companies.
32     It may be that Tan CB also desired to benefit himself, SAA, and/or members of the SAA Group. But even then, that does not mean that Tan CB could not have the requisite intention to injure the Plaintiffs. In this regard, conspirators do not have to act with the predominant purpose of causing injury (Gary Chan Kok Yew, 
The Law of Torts in Singapore
 (Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2016) (“
Gary Chan
”) at para 15.064, citing 
Quah Kay Tee v Ong and Co Pte Ltd
 
[1996] 3 SLR(R) 637
). Furthermore, as the Court of Appeal stated in 
EFT Holdings
 (at [101]), injury to the plaintiff may be either an end in itself or a means to an end. Thus, even if Tan CB had also desired to benefit himself and/or his allies, that would all the more be evidence that he did intend to cause injury to the Plaintiffs, as the deprivation of the Plaintiffs of all benefit of the 2007 Head Lease was the necessary means by which Tan CB would be able to satisfy such desire.
33     Apart from the element of intention, it also cannot be disputed that Tan CB’s decision for SAA not to grant the sub-tenancies to the JV Companies, which I had found and the Court of Appeal agreed constituted repudiatory breach of the Consent Order (see above at [17]), qualified as an unlawful act required to establish a claim in unlawful means conspiracy (see, generally, 
Gary Chan
 at para 15.068).
34     The real question now is whether Tan CB had acted alone or with other individuals in concert. While there may be a legal issue of whether SAA can conspire with its own director, a decision on this issue is unnecessary since (as will be explained) I have found a conspiracy between certain individual Defendants to injure the Plaintiffs by unlawful means.
35     However, I should mention that SAA did not act alone. Indeed, it could not have: to deprive the JV Companies of the benefit of the sub-tenancies, SAA needed the cooperation of the JV Companies themselves. When the 2004 STAs expired without SAA granting the third tranche of the sub-tenancies to the JV Companies, this did not mean that the Site ceased to have any business. In reality, what happened was that SAA took over the contractual arrangements which the JV Companies would have had with the ultimate sub-tenants for another three years. By doing so, SAA effectively reaped the benefits of this exercise while depriving the JV Companies of the corresponding benefit from a further continuation of the contractual arrangements with the ultimate sub-tenants. It is not important how SAA achieved this, 
eg
, by entering into new contractual arrangements directly with the sub-tenants or by requiring the JV Companies to assign to SAA the benefits of existing contractual arrangements with the ultimate sub-tenants. What is clear is that the JV Companies must have assisted SAA on this course of action by, at the very least, acquiescing in this state of affairs. Practically speaking, Tan CB was also a director of each of the JV Companies at the material time (see Annex A), which were in fact controlled by the SAA Group, or some or one of the members in that group.
Roger Koh 
36     The first individual I consider who may have acted in concert with Tan CB is Roger Koh because the facts concerning Roger Koh are clearer than those concerning Tan Senior and Ong CK.
37     On the facts, it is undisputed that Roger Koh was a party to the MOU and also a party to the Consent Order. Roger Koh was not a director of SAA but he was from June 2001 a director of TCPL, and from February 2004 a director of TCAE (see Annex A). Although the Plaintiffs alleged that Roger Koh was doing the bidding of the Tan family (
ie
, Tan Senior and Tan CB), Roger Koh disagreed. He maintained that he was a “successful businessman in his own right”.
[note: 7]
38     It does not matter for present purposes whether Roger Koh was a puppet of the Tan family or if he could make his own decisions. More importantly, Roger Koh’s Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief (“AEIC”) did not dispute that he knew what Tan CB was doing through SAA and also the JV Companies. Rather, his defence was that it was ridiculous for the Plaintiffs to allege that SAA was obliged to grant the sub-tenancies to the JV Companies.
[note: 8]
 As the Court of Appeal has concluded that the parties to the Consent Order would obviously have known the contrary, this defence must fail. It must also follow that Roger Koh knew that what Tan CB was doing was in breach of the Consent Order, but nevertheless acted in concert with him to partake in that breach, intending thereby to cause injury to the Plaintiffs.
39     Was the conduct of Roger Koh simply one of acquiescence, 
ie
, that he passively stood by and allowed Tan CB to do as he wished with the JV Companies? I do not think so. I am of the view that it was likely that Tan CB consulted Roger Koh and obtained his agreement with the course of conduct in question especially if, as Roger Koh himself alleged, Roger Koh was a successful businessman in his own right. Tan CB knew that Roger Koh was a party to the Consent Order, and he also knew that SAA’s decision not to grant the sub-tenancies for the third tranche would result in a breach of the Consent Order which would in turn mean that Roger Koh would, at the least, also be in breach of the Consent Order.
40     Furthermore, I note that Roger Koh also said in his AEIC that when the sub-tenancies for the first tranche were about to expire, he had told Tan CB not to issue fresh sub-tenancies for the second tranche to the JV Companies as Roger Koh was by then already uncomfortable with the idea of having to work with the Plaintiffs for another three years.
[note: 9]
 However, Tan CB decided to renew the sub-tenancies as he was hopeful that the relationship between the two groups would mend. If Roger Koh were to be believed on this point, then it was also more likely than not that he did have his say and played an active role in the decision for SAA not to grant sub-tenancies for the third tranche to the JV Companies.
41     In any event, the mere fact that an alleged conspirator did not expressly agree to or actively participate in a conspiracy does not mean that he cannot be equally liable by acquiescence. In this regard, two points are notable.
(a)     A combination between conspirators need not be in the nature of an express agreement. The Court may infer the existence of a combination from the circumstances and acts of the alleged conspirators (
EFT Holdings
 at [113]; 
Raiffeisen Zentralbank Osterreich AG v Archer Daniels Midland Co and others
 
[2007] 1 SLR(R) 196
 at [96]), so long as the alleged conspirators are “sufficiently aware of the surrounding circumstances and share the object for it properly to be said that they were acting in concert at the time of the acts complained of” (
Kuwait Oil Tanker Co SAK v Al Bader
 [2000] 2 All ER (Comm) 271 at [111]; endorsed by the Court of Appeal in 
EFT Holdings
 at [113]). In this regard, a conspirator need not know all the details of the plot as long as he is aware of the common objective and what his role in bringing it about involves (
The Dolphina
 at [282]).
(b)     For the purposes of unlawful means conspiracy, the “unlawful means” could be effected through an omission (
The Dolphina
 at [269]).
42     The 1st to 4th Defendants submitted that the proposition that “unlawful means” can take the form of an omission applies only where the defendant had knowledge of and was in a position to prevent the unlawful act but did not act.
[note: 10]
 In support, they summarised the facts of 
The Dolphina
 to be one where the defendant ship owner had knowledge of the fraud that the charterer was perpetuating, and was in a position to prevent the charterer from effecting the fraud by demanding the return of the bill of lading in question which was used to facilitate that fraud, but did not do so.
[note: 11]
43     It is not clear if the 1st to 4th Defendants’ narrow reading of the legal proposition on conspiracy by omission in 
The Dolphina
 is sustainable. In any event, even taking their summary of the facts at face value, I am of the view that the conduct of the defendant ship owner in 
The Dolphina
 is closely analogous to that of Roger Koh in the present case. As I have explained, the JV Companies must have assisted SAA on the conspired course of conduct, at the very least, by acquiescing in the state of affairs (see above at [35]). Roger Koh, as a shareholder and a director of both the JV Companies at the material time, was in a position to object when SAA declined to grant the sub-tenancies for the third tranche and when SAA took over the contractual arrangements with the ultimate sub-tenants. Instead, Roger Koh stood by and acquiesced in Tan CB’s decision to appropriate to SAA the whole benefit of the 2007 Head Lease, and he was content for this to happen even though it exposed him to liability under the Consent Order. In such circumstances, Roger Koh’s acquiescence (even assuming that his role was so limited) constituted “unlawful means”, and by such conduct he must have intended to deprive the JV Companies of the benefits of the third tranche of the sub-tenancies, thereby causing injury to the Plaintiffs. I add that even if Roger Koh had merely acquiesced, it would not have been due to a lack of intention on his part to cause injury to the Plaintiffs but because there would have been no active role that he needed to play in order to perpetrate the unlawful breach of the Consent Order. Thus, Roger Koh would still be liable for conspiracy by unlawful means.
Tan Senior 
44     I come now to Tan Senior. He was a director of SAA from 25 October 1999 to 23 February 2001 (see Annex A). He was also a shareholder of SAA until 23 February 2001. That date is of some importance because the MOU was dated 8 March 2001, about two weeks after he ceased to be a shareholder of SAA.
45     Tan Senior took various points to distance himself from the breaches of the Consent Order:
(a)     First, Tan Senior’s position was that in or around late 2000, when he was in his mid-50s, he wanted to let his children and in particular, Tan CB, gradually take over his business. Accordingly, on or about 23 February 2001, he sold his shares in SAA to Tan CB and ceased to be a shareholder and director of SAA (see Annex A). Thereafter, he stopped being involved in SAA’s business. In relation to the JV Companies which were incorporated in April 2001, Tan Senior explained that although he held 11.25% of the shares in each of the JV Companies and was appointed chairman for the meetings of these companies, it was Tan CB who was actually in charge of the day-to-day management of these companies. It was also Tan CB who handled the Plaintiffs’ enquiries on the financial affairs of the JV Companies. Furthermore, on or about 1 November 2002, Tan Senior sold his shares in TCPL and TCAE to SAA.
[note: 12]
 In cross-examination, he said he did so as he was tired and he wanted to let Tan CB take over.
[note: 13]
 As he had handed over his businesses to Tan CB before the occurrence of the breach of the Consent Order, Tan Senior was not involved in any conspiracy to injure the Plaintiffs through SAA.
(b)     Secondly, Tan Senior made the point that as regards the initial tender for the Site in 2001, although SAA was interested in participating in the tender, he had a separate interest in the opportunity. This was because another of his businesses, 
ie
, Kallang Auto, had a sub-lease of a site near Kallang which was due to expire in or around 2002.
[note: 14]
 If SAA succeeded in the tender, he would discuss with Tan CB as to when and how the existing tenants of Kallang Auto could rent spaces at the Site. Thus, Tan Senior’s interest and involvement in SAA was limited to this extent.
(c)     Thirdly, on 29 August 2003, a creditor bank obtained a bankruptcy order against Tan Senior. He then ceased to be a director of the JV Companies. Tan Senior alleged that from the time of the bankruptcy order onwards he had no further involvement in these companies nor did he have access to their documents and accounts. He could not therefore have been complicit in the breach of the Consent Order.
46     I am of the view that none of these arguments suffices to distance Tan Senior from the conspiracy effected through SAA and the JV Companies.
47     In relation to the first point, I am of the view that, in reality, Tan Senior still had an interest and a continued involvement in SAA and the JV Companies even though he had purportedly intended to allow Tan CB to take over his businesses.
48     First, I am aware that Tan Senior did say in his AEIC that he had transferred his shares in SAA on or about 23 February 2001 to Tan CB as he wanted Tan CB to gradually take over his business interests. Whether or not this reason is true, it was not simply because he was feeling tired and wanted to cease all involvement in his business ventures. If that had been the case in February 2001, Tan Senior would not have taken a personal interest and stake in the Joint Venture subsequently in March 2001. As Tan Senior accepted, he was a party to the MOU in his own personal capacity, and under the terms of the MOU he was to have a 12.5% stake in the Joint Venture.
[note: 15]
49     Second, I do not accept Tan Senior’s suggestion that he was chairman of the JV Companies in name only. Whether or not Tan CB was managing these companies, Tan Senior was involved and played a role in the management of their affairs. After all, Tan Senior disagreed that he was just a robot controlled by his son, Tan CB.
[note: 16]
 Further, according to Tan Senior, Tan CB had explained to him the documents of each of the JV Companies before he signed them.
[note: 17]
 There would have been no need to do so if he was only a chairman in name. I also note that when TCPL obtained a credit facility totalling S$12.7m from DBS Bank Ltd in June 2001, Tan Senior was one of the guarantors.
[note: 18]
 It is unlikely that Tan Senior’s involvement in the JV Companies absolutely ceased when he retained such a significant economic interest in their operation and viability.
50     Importantly, I also do not agree that when Tan Senior transferred his shares in each of the JV Companies to SAA on or about 1 November 2002, it was because he was tired and wanted to let Tan CB take over the businesses. It is not logical for someone who had been as interested and involved in the Joint Venture as Tan Senior was, and who had taken a personal stake in the Joint Venture and signed the MOU dated 8 March 2001, to transfer his shares in each of the JV Companies on or about 1 November 2002, less than two years later, just because he was tired. Tan Senior said that he was 71 years old when he was cross-examined on 16 September 2014.
[note: 19]
 This means that he was about 58 years of age when the MOU was signed on or about 8 March 2001 and about 59 or 60 years of age when he transferred his shares in each of the JV Companies on or about 1 November 2002. No elaboration was given to explain the sudden onset of tiredness between 8 March 2001 and November 2002. It is likely that the true reason for the transfer of shares was that Tan Senior must have already been facing financial difficulties in November 2002 (keeping in mind that he was made a bankrupt on 29 August 2003, which was less than a year later), and that his transfer of shares was done in anticipation of his financial predicament.
51     In relation to the second point, I also do not agree that Tan Senior’s interest in the Site was for the limited reason that he suggested, 
ie
, if SAA won the initial tender, he would then discuss with Tan CB as to when and how the tenants of Kallang Auto could rent spaces at the Site. In cross-examination, Tan Senior sought to give the impression that this was SAA’s project as SAA was bidding for the Site.
[note: 20]
 However, it was clear to me that SAA was only the corporate vehicle used to do so. It is notable that in the MOU, which was signed about two weeks after the bids for the Site’s tender were submitted, Tan Senior was named personally as one of the parties to the Joint Venture, and under the MOU, Tan Senior was to have a 12.5% personal stake in the Joint Venture.
[note: 21]
 These facts show that Tan Senior had not told the truth about the extent of his interest in the Project. His attempt to minimise his role and distance himself from the Joint Venture is likely to be an afterthought.
52     In this regard, I add that under the MOU, the SAA Group was to hold 62.5% of the shares in the New Company to be set up. When Tan Senior was asked to explain how the 62.5% shareholding was derived, he was evasive. He was also evasive in answering whether there were in fact eight parties in the Joint Venture with each party holding 12.5% or one-eighth of the shares.
[note: 22]
 These observations buttress the conclusion that Tan Senior was not forthcoming about his involvement and interest in the Joint Venture.
53     The more important question pertains to the third point, 
ie
, whether Tan Senior ceased all involvement with the Joint Venture on 29 August 2003 when he was made a bankrupt and ceased also to be a director of the JV Companies. In my view, the answer is no: Tan Senior’s bankruptcy did not materially affect his involvement with the Joint Venture.
54     At the outset, I agree that it is not clear whether Tan Senior was a party to the Consolidated Suits at the time they were consolidated. If it had been clear that Tan Senior was a party to the Consolidated Suits, that may be evidence of his continued involvement in the matters of the Joint Venture notwithstanding his bankruptcy. However, according to Tan Senior, although two of the Plaintiffs named him as a defendant in OS 1634/02 in 2002, the (three) Plaintiffs did not name him as a defendant in S 703/04 in 2004. Tan Senior suggested that this illustrated that the Plaintiffs knew that he was no longer involved in the Joint Venture after his bankruptcy. He alleged that he was also not a party to the Consolidated Suits.
55     I note that the Consent Order did specifically state that it constituted a full and final settlement of all claims that the Plaintiffs may have against the 1st to 5th defendants in OS 1634/02 and the 1st to 3rd defendants in S 703/04. The preamble of the Consent Order also stated that the Court had heard counsel for the plaintiffs and counsel for the defendants in the Consolidated Suits. Interestingly, the Consent Order went on to refer to a bidding exercise by the Plaintiffs and “the Defendants” as defined therein, which definition included Tan Senior. Perhaps this was due to poor drafting, as the definition of “the Defendants” in the Consent Order also included the JV Companies and yet there was no suggestion that either of these two companies was going to bid for shares in any of the JV Companies. Nevertheless, it is still of note that no one from the SAA Group or “the Defendants” as defined in the Consent Order or their solicitors sought to make it clear to the Court there, including in any correspondence soon after the date of the Consent Order, that Tan Senior was not to be involved at all in the bidding exercise as he had ceased to be involved in the Joint Venture ever since the bankruptcy order.
56     That said, the Plaintiffs appeared to accept that Tan Senior was not a party to the Consent Order. For example, Lim Ah Poh, who is one of the Plaintiffs, accepted that Rajah & Tann (who was acting for other Defendants then) did not act for Tan Senior when the Consent Order was entered into.
[note: 23]
 Unfortunately, Rajah & Tann did not elaborate as to why the Consent Order was worded as it was if, in fact, they did not represent Tan Senior for the Consent Order.
57     However, even if Tan Senior was not a party to the Consent Order, SAA was very much a party to and involved in the Consent Order. Was SAA controlled by Tan CB only, or in truth controlled by Tan Senior as well as Tan CB? Tan Senior suggested the former. The Plaintiffs suggested the latter and alleged that Tan Senior and Ong CK were the masterminds behind the conspiracy against the Plaintiffs. For present purposes, it is not necessary to specifically identify the mastermind(s).
58     Nevertheless, an indication of Tan Senior’s continued involvement in affairs of the Joint Venture even after his bankruptcy in August 2003 can be found in the evidence of his daughter, Tan Bee Bee. Tan CB was not the only child of Tan Senior involved in SAA or the JV Companies. Tan Bee Bee was also a director of SAA. In her AEIC which she filed for the present action, she said that from April 2001 to May 2003, she was in charge of the administration of payments and receipts for the JV Companies as they were newly incorporated companies and did not have full-time administrative staff. Thereafter, when permanent staff were employed, she supervised the administration of these two companies.
[note: 24]
59     Tan Bee Bee said that in April 2001, her father and Tan CB informed her that “they had successfully tendered for a lease of [the Site] through SAA”.
[note: 25]
 This part of her AEIC confirmed that Tan Senior was using SAA to bid for the Site’s tender,
[note: 26]
 and that contradicted the suggestion of a more limited interest on Tan Senior’s part and the claim that he acted only out of concern for the then -existing tenants of Kallang Auto (see above at [45(b)]).
60     Later in her AEIC, Tan Bee Bee referred to the Plaintiffs’ various allegations in the present action that they consistently faced obstruction in obtaining information on the financial matters of the JV Companies, and responded: “My father is an experienced and reputable businessman. He is open and aboveboard in all his corporate dealings. Furthermore, the [JV] Companies’ accounts are audited on a yearly basis. There is therefore absolutely nothing to hide from the Plaintiffs in relation to the [JV] Companies’ affairs”.
[note: 27]
61     Unsurprisingly, the Plaintiffs submitted that Tan Bee Bee’s response to the Plaintiffs’ allegations revealed the true state of affairs and showed that it was Tan Senior who had been calling the shots behind the Joint Venture.
62     In my view, Tan Bee Bee’s response in her AEIC to the Plaintiffs’ allegations was possibly directed to allegations made before OS 1634/02 was filed. Therefore, it was arguable that Tan Bee Bee’s reference to her father being open and aboveboard was in the context of that time frame and was not intended to apply to the situation 
ex post
 Tan Senior’s bankruptcy. Nevertheless, Tan Bee Bee’s AEIC did suggest that it was her father who was controlling the JV Companies at least initially. Instead of saying that it was Tan CB who was controlling the JV Companies all along and that her father did not have any say in the JV Companies, which would have been an obvious point to take had that been the case, she stressed that her father had been open and aboveboard in all his corporate dealings. Furthermore, it was also telling that although her AEIC was filed for the present action in which an allegation of conspiracy had been made against her father in the context of the breaches of the Consent Order, and even though her AEIC did address various steps taken pursuant to the Consent Order, Tan Bee Bee did not once say that her father had ceased all involvement in SAA and in the JV Companies after the bankruptcy order against him was made. In the circumstances, I agree that the suggestion from Tan Bee Bee’s AEIC was that Tan Senior had been calling the shots in both SAA and the JV Companies.
63     Even if Tan Bee Bee had said that Tan Senior was not involved in the JV Companies after he was made a bankrupt, the question is whether a person who had been controlling SAA and the JV Companies had simply relinquished all involvement in these three companies upon a bankruptcy order being made. Did Tan Senior truly relinquish all involvement, being content to leave it to Tan CB to carry on the businesses, or did Tan Senior in fact continue to be involved through and/or with Tan CB?
64     Unfortunately for Tan Senior, I find him to be an unreliable witness who pretended to be less involved in the Joint Venture before the bankruptcy order than was truly the case. Tan CB was also not a truthful witness who had pretended that he thought he was doing nothing wrong after the Consent Order was made. I do not believe the evidence of either of them that after the bankruptcy order, Tan Senior was not involved in any of these three companies at all, or in particular, the decision for SAA not to grant sub-tenancies for the third tranche to the JV Companies.
65     I add that Tan CB’s date of birth is 14 November 1967.
[note: 28]
 He has an engineering degree and had worked initially with the Housing and Development Board. In 1994, he joined Goodland, a company which he maintained that his father and brother were founding members. Goodland was subsequently the contractor engaged to carry out works at the Site. Tan Senior said that Tan CB already had business experience in Goodland prior to Tan CB being appointed a director of SAA. According to Tan CB, SAA itself was acquired by Tan Senior, Ong CK, and himself in or around 1999.
[note: 29]
 Although Tan Senior did not entirely agree that he was the one who taught Tan CB about business when the latter joined Goodland, Tan Senior did say “[h]alf-half” when he was asked this question. He declined to agree that he continued to give Tan CB guidance when Tan CB joined SAA as a director.
[note: 30]
 Nevertheless, I am of the view that Tan Senior did teach and guide Tan CB in business matters when Tan CB joined Goodland and that such consultation and guidance continued even later when Tan CB joined SAA. Tan Senior’s role did not abruptly end when Tan CB was appointed a director of SAA or even when Tan Senior became a bankrupt.
66     In the circumstances, even though the Plaintiffs accepted that they did not have direct evidence of Tan Senior’s complicity, it was likely that Tan CB still consulted Tan Senior before and after the Consent Order, and that Tan Senior and Tan CB agreed that SAA should appropriate the benefit of the 2007 Head Lease to itself even though that would mean breaching the Consent Order.
Ong CK 
67     Finally, I turn to discuss the role of Ong CK. I should mention that the Plaintiffs’ counsel informed the Court that they were not pursuing any claim against Ong CK although they maintained that he was part of the conspiracy. Nevertheless, I will still consider his role in the event that the issue becomes relevant.
68     Ong CK is an architect by profession. He was a shareholder and principal director of AGA which was engaged to perform architectural services for the Site pursuant to the Joint Venture. Although he and Tan CB were not named in the first page of the MOU as one of the Joint Venture parties, both of them signed on the second page of the MOU. Whether they did so to signify that they were individual and direct parties to the MOU, or they did so on behalf of SAA who was in fact a party to the MOU, was a matter of some contention in the trial. I have concluded in the HC Judgment that Tan CB and Ong CK were parties to the Joint Venture in their personal capacities (see HC Judgment at [211]–[218]) and this finding was undisturbed by the Court of Appeal. However, even if Tan CB and Ong CK were involved indirectly through their interest in SAA, this is not material for present purposes.
69     Based on Ong CK’s AEIC, it was Tan Senior (and not Tan CB) who had asked him about the Site in or about February 2001.
[note: 31]
 Ong CK involved Tan CB in early meetings and discussions about plans for the Site.
[note: 32]
 However, it was Tan Senior who later told Ong CK and Tan CB that he wanted to involve Roger Koh and Samuel Ng in the plan to bid for and develop the Site.
[note: 33]
 Furthermore, Ong CK said that on or about 2 March 2001, he received a call from Tan Senior who informed him about the Plaintiffs, whom Tan Senior believed could contribute about 80 used car tenants and wanted to include in the development of the Site.
[note: 34]
70     These allegations show two things. First, that Tan Senior’s interest in the Site was not limited to asking for space for the tenants of Kallang Auto should SAA win the bid for the Site, as he had suggested. Secondly, Ong CK had a closer relationship with Tan Senior than with Tan CB, and this relation was not just a professional one where only Ong CK’s professional services were engaged, but also and more importantly a business relationship. It may be true that Ong CK and Tan CB were discussing details of the intended Joint Venture with the Plaintiffs. However, the main business decisions including who was going to participate in the Joint Venture were discussed between and substantially decided by Ong CK and Tan Senior. Furthermore, insofar as Ong CK maintained that Tan Senior had been planning to retire from SAA for some time and actually retired in February 2001 (when Tan Senior transferred his shares in SAA to Tan CB),
[note: 35]
 Ong CK back-pedalled in cross-examination to say that he did not know the details of Tan Senior’s retirement plans.
[note: 36]
 Indeed, Ong CK also said that SAA could still tap on Tan Senior’s experience and seek his advice.
[note: 37]
71     It is not disputed that Ong CK was involved in discussions with Tan Senior, as mentioned above, and with Tan CB on details of the Joint Venture. Therefore, Ong CK was not involved solely in his capacity as a professional architect but also as a business partner. That is why he drafted a business plan for discussion with the Plaintiffs (either before or after the MOU was signed) and it was he who drafted the MOU. He was also a director and a shareholder of each of the JV Companies although he alleged that he was holding his shares in these companies on behalf of SAA. These facts show the extent of Ong CK’s involvement in the Joint Venture from the business point of view.
72     On 8 March 2001, when the MOU was signed, the shareholders of SAA were Tan CB and OCK International Pte Ltd (“OCK International”). Tan Senior had ceased to be a shareholder of SAA as he had transferred his shares to Tan CB on 23 February 2001. The shareholders of OCK International were Ong CK himself and Novelty Department Store Pte Ltd, with each of them holding respectively 75% and 25% of the shares of OCK International.
[note: 38]
73     Ong CK participated in the business of the Joint Venture as a business partner and as an architect providing professional services at least until the date he became a bankrupt on 5 March 2004. Prior to his bankruptcy, Ong CK transferred his shares in OCK International to his brother. He said this was because he needed money. He alleged that since his bankruptcy, he ceased to be involved with the Joint Venture except to provide assistance to the successor architect for the renewal of the relevant planning permissions in 2004 and in 2009.
74     The Plaintiffs relied on some evidence to show that Ong CK was still rendering assistance to SAA even after his bankruptcy, but Ong CK maintained that such assistance was rendered only because of his professional involvement in the past with the Project. As the evidence was equivocal, it does not assist and I need not elaborate on it.
75     However, the question still remains whether it is true that Ong CK ceased to have any involvement in the Joint Venture as a business partner since his bankruptcy. As he had transferred his shares in OCK International to his brother before his bankruptcy, this suggested that Ong CK and his brother believed that there was value in such shares worth preserving and, consequently, value in the business of SAA. The question is whether this was a genuine transfer to his brother, who had thereafter taken over his shares and business interest in the Joint Venture or whether the brother was really holding the shares in trust for, as a nominee for, or otherwise on behalf of Ong CK. Ong CK suggested the former.
76     Significantly, there was no further elaboration of Ong CK’s brother’s interest in the Joint Venture after the transfer of shares to him. It appeared that Ong CK’s brother was uninterested in the Joint Venture after having received Ong CK’s shares. There was no evidence from the brother, and Tan CB was trying to give the impression that he acted alone after the bankruptcies of Tan Senior and Ong CK.
[note: 39]
77     In my view, Ong CK’s interest and involvement in the Joint Venture did not simply evaporate upon his bankruptcy. This is because his brother did not truly take over his interest. His brother was holding the shares transferred to him on behalf of Ong CK, and Ong CK was still involved as a business partner in the Joint Venture. It was likely that both Tan Senior and Ong CK continued to discuss and be involved in major affairs of the Joint Venture both before and after their respective bankruptcy orders and also both before and after the Consent Order was made. They also discussed with Tan CB (who was the person executing the decisions) matters relating to the Joint Venture, in particular, the issue of whether SAA should extend the sub-tenancies for the third tranche to the JV Companies in accordance with the Consent Order. As was the case for Tan Senior and Tan CB, Ong CK intended by the course of conduct to cause injury to the Plaintiffs. It is immaterial whether Tan Senior and Ong CK were the masterminds, or if all three of them were the co-masterminds.
78     I add that I find Ong CK not to be credible on some contentious issues. For example, he said that the MOU was meant to cover a three year period only and not “3 years + 3 years + 3 years”. Yet a business plan that he had himself prepared referred to a head lease from the SLA for a period of “3 years + 3 years + 3 years”. When this was pointed out to him, he tried to shift the blame by saying that his personal assistant had put together part of the plan.
[note: 40]
 This was incredulous.
79     Furthermore, when it was pointed out to Ong CK that the sub-tenancies to each of the JV Companies for the first tranche had express provisions for two options for renewal for a period of three years each, he initially said that he took issue with a lawyer regarding this provision, but then said he did not pay attention to the provision. He could not explain the existence of these options if the JV Companies were supposed to be given single three-year sub-tenancies only.
[note: 41]
80     As another example, Ong CK also suggested that the Joint Venture was in respect only of certain premises on the Site pertaining to the used car centre, and therefore did not include the retail component, even though it was quite clear that the MOU was not so restricted.
[note: 42]
81     In my view, the extent to which Ong CK was prepared to tell untruths at the trial of the present action suggested that he was not merely attempting to help a friend, 
ie
, Tan CB, in his dispute with the Plaintiffs, but that he was not forthcoming about his actual involvement and interest in the Joint Venture.
82     Accordingly, I conclude that Ong CK was a party to a conspiracy, which included Tan Senior and Tan CB, to injure the Plaintiffs by denying sub-tenancies for the third tranche to the JV Companies and appropriating the benefit of the 2007 Head Lease to SAA instead.
Tort of inducement of breach of contract
83     Generally, to establish the tort of inducement of breach of contract, the plaintiff must prove the following elements (see 
Gary Chan
 at paras 15.005–15.025; 
Tribune Investment Trust Inc v Soosan Trading Co Ltd
 
[2000] 2 SLR(R) 407
 (“
Tribune Investment
”) at [17]–[18]):
[note: 43]
(a)     the alleged tortfeasor knew of the existence of the contract;
(b)     the alleged tortfeasor intended to interfere with the plaintiff’s contractual rights;
(c)     the alleged tortfeasor directly procured or induced a third party to breach the contract;
(d)     the contract was in fact breached; and
(e)     the plaintiff suffered injury as a result of the breach of contract.
84     This cause of action concerns only those who were not parties or arguably not parties to the Consent Order, 
ie
, Tan CB, Tan Senior, and Ong CK. Roger Koh is a party to the Consent Order and therefore the issue of inducing a breach of the Consent Order does not arise.
85     In my view, Tan CB, Tan Senior, and Ong CK knew of the existence of the Consent Order at all material times. There was no suggestion to the contrary. It is also not disputable, at this stage of the proceedings, that elements (d) and (e) are satisfied, 
ie
, that the Consent Order had in fact been breached and that the Plaintiffs suffered injury as a consequence. Accordingly, the focus of the analysis is on elements (b) and (c), which I analyse in relation to Tan CB, Tan Senior, and Ong CK in turn.
Tan CB
86     There is no question that Tan CB intended to interfere with the Plaintiffs’ contractual right represented by the Consent Order by deciding that SAA would not grant the sub-tenancies for the third tranche to the JV Companies, and would thereby appropriate the whole benefit of the 2007 Head Lease to itself in breach of the Consent Order.
[note: 44]
 Indeed, as discussed above (at [29]–[31]), interference with the contractually envisaged mechanism and outcome under the Consent Order was precisely Tan CB’s object.
87     As for the element of procurement, there is no question that Tan CB, as the person who admitted that he had made the decision for SAA not to grant the sub-tenancies to the JV Companies, directly procured SAA’s breach of the Consent Order.
88     The issue, however, is whether the 
Said v Butt
 exception applies to exonerate Tan CB from liability for the tort.
[note: 45]
 This exception was concisely stated by Vinodh Coomaraswamy J as follows: “[a] director is not liable to a third party for inducing or procuring the breach of contract [by] the company of which he is a director if: (i) he is acting 
bona fide
 in the discharge of his office as a director; and (ii) he is acting within the scope of his authority” (
Tembusu Growth Fund Ltd v ACTAtek, Inc and others
 
[2015] SGHC 206
 at [117]; citing 
Said v Butt
 
[1920] 3 KB 497
 at 506 and 
Chong Hon Kuan Ivan v Levy Maurice (No 2)
 
[2004] 4 SLR 801
). One view of the exception is that it is premised on the reasoning that “the director [who induced a breach by the company] is the company’s 
alter ego
 and his acts are in law those of the company” (
Ng Joo Soon (alias Nga Ju Soon) v Dovechem Holdings Pte Ltd and another suit
 
[2011] 1 SLR 1155
 at [76]; 
cf Gary Chan
 at para 15.013).
89     In my view, Tan CB’s conduct cannot be said to be 
bona fide
 in the discharge of his office as a director of SAA. In 
Otech Pakistan Pvt Ltd v Clough Engineering Ltd and another
 
[2005] SGHC 98
, Kan Ting Chiu J explained (at [25]), in the context of the 
Said v Butt
 exception, that:
… [
bona fide
] is to be taken to mean that the defendant was acting in good faith in the discharge of his office, and not that he was acting in good faith in the action complained of; a director may believe that it is for the good of the company to breach a contract intentionally. In such a situation, the principle would operate to defeat the claim … as a matter of law.
90     However, even if I examine only Tan CB’s conduct in relation to SAA, I am not satisfied that Tan CB decided to procure SAA’s breach of the Consent Order 
bona fide
 in the interests of SAA. There is a clear degree of dishonesty on the part of Tan CB, who had not just intended to procure a breach of the Consent Order but indeed sought to deceive the Plaintiffs into a course of conduct that ran contrary to the letter and spirit of the Consent Order and would lead to the SAA Group benefiting from an unmerited windfall (see above at [30]–[31]). Against this backdrop, Tan CB had no qualms in making use of his directorship to abuse SAA as the vehicle for his questionable conduct. In the circumstances, Tan CB clearly did not pursue this course of conduct in the interest of SAA. In any event, it was Tan CB’s own position that he had procured the breach of the Consent Order not for the interest of SAA, but because he was purportedly concerned about the impact of a possible liquidation of the JV Companies on the ultimate sub-tenants at the Site. It is apparent, in my view, that if Tan CB could be said to be acting 
bona fide
 in the interest of SAA and thus be exculpated from liability, that would render the concept of 
bona fides
 meaningless.
91     I add that it is doubtful that, as a matter of law, the 
Said v Butt
 exception will be satisfied whenever a director procures the company of which he is a director to breach a contract, so long as there is some benefit that accrues to the company. If that is the case, the exception would appear to be too broad, since it is likely that all or most breaches of contract will lead to some benefit accruing to the party-in-breach in the sense that he will thenceforth be released from his contractual obligations. It may be that there must be something more. In the absence of full arguments, I will leave these nuances to be addressed in a subsequent appropriate case.
92     Separately, counsel for Roger Koh also raised the defence of justification, which I consider here in relation to all of the Defendants concerned, 
ie
¸ Tan CB, Tan Senior, and Ong CK.
[note: 46]
 According to 
Gary Chan
, justification is a “little-known defence not given to any precise definition” (at para 15.023). It would appear that the existence of this defence is consistent with the Court of Appeal’s statement of the law on inducement of breach of contract in 
Tribune Investment
: “[t]o knowingly procure or induce a third party to break his contract to the damage of the other contracting party 
without reasonable justification or excuse
 forms the basis of the tort of inducing a breach of contract” [emphasis added] (at [16]).
93     However, even assuming the existence of such a defence in local jurisprudence, it is clearly not satisfied on the facts in relation to any of the three Defendants concerned. In 
Gary Chan
, two instances are raised in which the defence may be invoked: (a) where the alleged tortfeasor acted pursuant to his moral duty and not for the protection of his personal interests, and (b) where the alleged tortfeasor acted to protect a legal right which is equal or superior to that of the plaintiff (at paras 15.024–15.025). In this case, neither of these are satisfied. None of the Defendants acted to interfere with the Plaintiffs’ contractual right in the Consent Order out of moral duty. Nor is there any equal or superior right, such as a pre-existing contractual right, which the Defendants were seeking to protect. There is no other conceivable justification for the Defendants’ breach of the Consent Order.
94     Accordingly, neither the 
Said v Butt
 exception nor the defence of justification applied to exonerate Tan CB from liability for the tort of inducement of breach of contract.
Tan Senior 
95     Tan Senior clearly intended to interfere with the Plaintiffs’ contractual rights represented by the Consent Order. Indeed, as I have found above, Tan Senior agreed with Tan CB to procure SAA not to grant the sub-tenancies to the JV Companies (see above at [66]).
96     The element of direct procurement or inducement, however, is less obvious here.
97     The first question is whether there was in fact inducement or procurement by Tan Senior of the breach of the Consent Order. On this issue, I have concluded that Tan Senior had agreed with Tan CB for SAA to breach the Consent Order (see above at [66]). In my view, this agreement would constitute inducement by Tan Senior. In this regard, the fact of inducement can be inferred from relevant circumstantial evidence and need not necessarily be proved by direct evidence (see 
Gary Chan
 at para 15.014). In 
Abani Trading Pte Ltd v P T Delta Karina Mandiri and another
 
[2001] 3 SLR(R) 404
, Kan Ting Chiu J explained as follows (at [36]):
There was no direct evidence here that [the alleged tortfeasor] induced [the party-in-breach] to cancel the [contract], but the inquiry does not stop here. Direct evidence cannot and need not be shown in every case. Where one party sets out to subvert another’s contract, it may not leave direct evidence of its actions. In such a situation, the target should not be without remedy. All the relevant facts should be considered, and where appropriate, inducement can be inferred.
98     The second question relates to the directness of the procurement or inducement. Generally, direct inducement is necessary to establish the tort of inducement of breach of contract. Indirect inducement, on the other hand, will not suffice. In this regard, an inducement may be considered “indirect” if it is directed by the alleged tortfeasor at a third party (who is not privy to the contract intended to be breached), and that third party in turn procures or induces a contracting party to breach the contract. In these cases, the question is whether the interposition of an additional party between the alleged tortfeasor and the contracting party whose breach was ultimately induced will necessarily mean that the alleged tortfeasor’s inducement is not sufficiently “direct” to establish the tort. In the absence of full arguments, I make no comment on the general position, if any, that should be adopted.
99     However, it is clear that where the contracting party who ultimately committed the breach of contract is a corporate entity, it would suffice if the inducement of the breach “is addressed [by the alleged tortfeasor] to the managing director or 
alter ego
 of the company” (
Gary Chan
 at para 15.013). In other words, in the corporate context, the alleged tortfeasor in a claim for the tort of inducement of breach of contract by the company may be liable if the inducement was made to the company’s managing director or 
alter ego
. This must be so since a company acts through its officers and any inducement would have to be made to one or some of its officers. Whether the inducement must be made to an officer who holds at least the position of managing director or is the 
alter ego
 of the company is a point I need not decide since, in the present case, it is not disputed that Tan CB was making decisions for SAA and there was no suggestion of any other more senior officer in SAA than Tan CB.
100    In their submissions, the 1st to 4th Defendants suggested that the present case was a “prevention” case, and that a distinction should be drawn between cases involving an inducement to breach a contract and those involving conduct to prevent the contract from being performed.
[note: 47]
 According to the 1st to 4th Defendants, the latter category of cases are “prevention” cases, which are “wholly incompatible” with the tort of inducement of breach of contract.
[note: 48]
101    In a typical “prevention” case, the alleged tortfeasor either by his own conduct prevents or disables the contracting party from performing the contract, or addresses the inducement to a third party (who is not privy to the contract intended to be breached) and that third party in turn does an act which prevents or disables the contracting party from performing the contract. In either situation, there is no inducement by the alleged tortfeasor of the contracting party committing the breach of contract. Thus, rather than the tort of inducement of breach of contract, the appropriate cause of action for such “prevention” cases is the tort of causing loss by unlawful means (see 
OBG Ltd and another v Allan and others
 
[2008] 1 AC 1
 (“
OBG
”) at [34]–[38] (per Lord Hoffmann), [178] and [180] (per Lord Nicholls)).
102    The 1st to 4th Defendants cited 
GWK Ltd v Dunlop Rubber Co Ltd
 (1926) 42 TLR 376 (“
GWK
”). In that case, GWK, a car manufacturer, agreed with a tyre manufacturer, ARM, that the latter’s tyres would be fitted on all GWK cars exhibited for sale. Two of GWK’s cars were exhibited at a motor show. However, on the eve of the show, Dunlop removed ARM’s tyres from these two cars and replaced them with its own tyres.
103    It is clear that the facts of 
GWK
 are very different from the present case. There, it did not matter whether GWK as the contracting party intended to exhibit ARM’s tyres as contracted, or if GWK would otherwise have fulfilled its contractual obligations. Dunlop unilaterally acted to interfere with the contract. Thus, Dunlop could not be said to have induced GWK to breach GWK’s contract with ARM. The tort of inducement of breach of contract in that case would not apply, even though it may be that Dunlop would nevertheless be liable to GWK and/or ARM for other torts. In the present case, however, Tan Senior’s inducement was in the form of influence or persuasion targeted at SAA (through Tan CB) to cause SAA to breach the Consent Order. It was not the case that Tan Senior had unilaterally acted in a manner such as to prevent SAA from performing its obligations under the Consent Order.
104    Insofar as the 1st to 4th Defendants cited Lord Nicholls’s dictum in 
OBG
 at [178],
[note: 49]
 they omitted to cite it in full. After setting out the facts in 
GWK
, Lord Nicholls went on to explain (at [178]):
178    With hindsight it is evident that the application of the 
Lumley v Gye
 tort [of inducement of breach of contract] to a “prevention” case was unfortunate. There is a crucial difference between cases where the defendant induces a contracting party not to perform his contractual obligations and cases where the defendant prevents a contracting party from carrying out his contractual obligations. In inducement cases the very act of joining with the contracting party and inducing him to break his contract is sufficient to found liability as an accessory. 
In prevention cases the defendant does not join with the contracting party in a wrong (breach of contract) committed by the latter. There is no question of accessory liability. In prevention cases the defendant acts independently of the contracting party. The defendant’s liability is a “stand-alone” liability.
 Consistently with this, tortious liability does not arise in prevention cases unless, as was the position in 
GWK
, the preventative means used were independently unlawful.
[emphasis added]
105    Lord Nicholls’s dictum makes clear that in “prevention” cases, the tortfeasor acts independently of the contracting party. It also buttresses the conclusion that the present case is not a “prevention” case, since none of the Defendants in question “acted independently of the contracting party [
ie
, SAA]” (
OBG
 at [178]). The submission made by the 1st to 4th Defendants in this regard is therefore not applicable to the present case.
106    For completeness, I add that the 
Said v Butt
 exception does not apply in relation to Tan Senior since he was no longer a director of SAA by the time of the inducement or the breach (see Annex A). In any event, this exception may be inconsistent with Tan Senior’s defence, which was not that he had acted 
bona fide
 in his office as a director of SAA, but rather that he had not been involved in the affairs and decisions of SAA at all.
Ong CK
107    I will address Ong CK’s role in respect of the tort of inducement of breach of contract in case it becomes relevant, even though the Plaintiffs’ counsel said that they were not pursuing any claim against him.
108    Based on my finding above that Ong CK intended to injury the Plaintiffs by conspiring to ensure that SAA did not grant the sub-tenancies for the third tranche to the JV Companies (see above at [77]), it follows that Ong CK also had the requisite intention to interfere with the Plaintiffs’ contractual rights represented by the Consent Order.
109    As for the element of direct procurement and inducement, I have found that Ong CK had discussed important matters relating to the Joint Venture with Tan CB and, in particular, regarding Tan CB’s decision for SAA not to grant the sub-tenancies to the JV Companies (see above at [77]). Accordingly, there is a sufficiently direct nexus between Ong CK’s persuasion of Tan CB and SAA’s breach of the Consent Order.
110    The 
Said v Butt
 exception does not apply as Ong CK was not a director of SAA at the material time of the inducement or of the breach.
Conclusion 
111    For the foregoing reasons, I find Tan CB, Roger Koh, Tan Senior, and Ong CK liable for conspiracy to injure the Plaintiffs by unlawful means, 
ie
, by procuring or otherwise enabling the breach of the Consent Order. I also find Tan CB, Tan Senior, and Ong CK liable for the tort of inducing the breach of the Consent Order by SAA.
112    I will leave the question of costs to be decided by the Court of Appeal.

Introduction
1       I convicted the accused, Saravanan Chandaram, a 31 year old Malaysian citizen (“the Accused”) on two charges of importing into Singapore cannabis and cannabis mixture respectively, contrary to s 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the MDA”), which is punishable under either ss 33(1) or 33B(1) of the MDA. At the sentencing stage, following my finding that the Accused’s involvement in the offence was restricted to that of a “courier” as stated under s 33B(2)(
a
) of the MDA and the issuance of a certificate of substantive assistance by the Public Prosecutor (“the Prosecution”), I exercised my discretion under s 33B(1)(
a
) of the MDA to impose a global sentence of life imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane.
Background 
Undisputed facts
2       The Accused faced two charges. The first charge concerned the importation into Singapore of 1,383.6g of cannabis on 6 November 2014:
… on the 6
th
 day of November 2014, at about 10.40 a.m., at Woodlands Checkpoint, Singapore, did import into Singapore a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185, 2008 Rev. Ed.), 
to wit
, by bringing into Singapore 
ten (10) bundles containing not less than 1383.6 grams of vegetable matter which was analysed and found to be cannabis
, without any authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185, 2008 Rev. Ed.) and punishable under Section 33(1) of the said Act, and alternatively, upon conviction, you may be liable to be punished under Section 33B(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185, 2008 Rev. Ed.).
[emphasis in original]
The second charge concerned the importation into Singapore on the same day of 3,295.7g of fragmented vegetable matter containing cannabinol and tetrahydrocannabinol, commonly referred to as “cannabis mixture”:
… on the 6
th
 day of November 2014, at about 10.40 a.m., at Woodlands Checkpoint, Singapore, did import into Singapore, a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185, 2008 Rev Ed), 
to wit
, by bringing into Singapore 
ten (10) bundles containing not less than 3295.7 grams of fragmented vegetable matter which was analysed and found to contain cannabinol and tetrahydrocannabinol
, without any authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185, 2008 Rev. Ed.) and punishable under Section 33(1) of the said Act, and alternatively, upon conviction, you may be liable to be punished under Section 33B(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185, 2008 Rev. Ed.).
[emphasis in original]
3       An agreed statement of facts (“ASOF”) was tendered, duly signed by the Prosecution and the Defence, under s 267(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”). The facts agreed, together with the other undisputed facts, were as follows.
4       At the material time, the Accused was working as a driver and bodyguard for an unidentified Malaysian man, one “Aya”. The Accused knew that Aya was a drug syndicate leader in Malaysia, who organised the delivery of drug consignments into Singapore.
[note: 1]
5       On 5 November 2014, the Accused agreed with Aya to deliver ten bundles (“the Bundles”) to a customer in Singapore in return for a payment of S$5,000.
[note: 2]
 Following Aya’s instructions, the Accused rented for the delivery a Malaysian-registered car bearing vehicle number JNQ 4606 (“the Car”) and tinted its windows at a workshop.
[note: 3]
 The Accused then met Aya and collected the ten Bundles from him. The Accused concealed the Bundles in two areas of the Car: six bundles in the arm rest of the left rear passenger seat, and four bundles in that of the right rear passenger seat.
[note: 4]
 He then locked the Car and passed the Car keys to Aya. On the next day, at about 10.00am, the Accused collected the Car keys from Aya’s relative.
[note: 5]
 The Accused then drove the Car into Singapore via the Woodlands Checkpoint. Subsequently, at about 10.42am, a search was conducted on the Car at the inspection pit in the Accused’s presence.
[note: 6]
 As the Bundles were discovered by the enforcement authorities and suspected to contain controlled drugs, the Accused was arrested.
[note: 7]
6       The Accused admitted to bringing the Bundles into Singapore.
[note: 8]
 The Bundles contained not less than 1,383.6g of cannabis and not less than 3,295.7g of fragmented vegetable matter which was found to contain cannabinol and tetrahydrocannabinol.
[note: 9]
 Cannabis, cannabinol, and tetrahydrocannabinol are Class A controlled drugs listed in the First Schedule of the MDA. The Accused was not authorised to import these controlled drugs into Singapore under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder.
[note: 10]
7       Amongst others, two statements were recorded from the Accused.
[note: 11]
 In his contemporaneous statement dated 6 November 2014 and his cautioned statement dated 7 November 2014, the Accused made several references to “drugs”. Why he made these references was disputed by the parties: the Prosecution argued that this showed the Accused’s knowledge that he was carrying controlled drugs, while the Defence contended that the reference was made because the officers from Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) opened some of the Bundles and informed the Accused that they contained drugs.
Accused’s version of the facts
8       The Accused denied knowing, at the material time of the offence, that the Bundles were controlled drugs. The version given by the Accused was that he had been asked by Aya to deliver the Bundles to Singapore in order to repay a loan previously taken by him from Aya for his son’s operation. When asked to repay the loan by Aya, the Accused initially sought to repay it by way of deductions from his salary. However as Aya did not agree to this, the Accused agreed to deliver “tembakau” (which the Accused understood as tobacco)
[note: 12]
 but made it clear to Aya that he would not deliver drugs. The Accused knew of the serious consequences of drug trafficking in Singapore, including the possibility of capital punishment.
[note: 13]
 The Accused claimed that Aya offered to pay him RM2,000 to deliver ten packets of tobacco.
[note: 14]
 Aya reassured him that if he was arrested for smuggling tobacco, he would only get a few months’ imprisonment.
[note: 15]
9       The Accused eventually agreed to deliver the tobacco; his fears of arrest for smuggling tobacco was overcome when he smoked some “ice” just before the delivery.
[note: 16]
The Prosecution’s case
10     The Prosecution’s primary case was that the respective presumptions of possession and knowledge of the nature of the drugs under ss 18(1) and 18(2) of the MDA applied and was unrebutted.
11     By virtue of s 18(1) of the MDA, the Accused was presumed to be in possession of the drugs concealed in the Bundles because he was in control of the Car when it was driven into Singapore.
[note: 17]
12     The presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA was not rebutted, applying 
Obeng Comfort v Public Prosecutor
 
[2017] 1 SLR 633
 (“
Obeng Comfort
”). The Accused’s version that he thought he was bringing in tobacco was not sufficient to rebut the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA.
13     The Accused’s bare defence that he thought he was bringing contraband tobacco into Singapore was not believable. This belief was unfounded because of the suspicious circumstances surrounding the delivery of the Bundles. For instance, the Accused was paid a disproportionately high amount of S$5,000, as captured in the ASOF,
[note: 18]
 an amount higher than the typical sale price of ten bundles of tobacco.
[note: 19]
 There were also other suspicious circumstances suggesting that this was not an ordinary delivery. There was a short notice for the delivery despite there being no reason for any urgency; a Car was rented, the windows of the Car were tinted, and the Bundles were concealed. Furthermore, parts of the contents of the Bundles were clearly visible to the Accused and the Accused admitted to being able to distinguish between cannabis and tobacco by sight. The Accused also had no reason to trust Aya, whom he only knew from three months before. They had no personal relationship, only a working one. Tellingly, the Accused knew that Aya was a drug dealer. As the Accused had seen tobacco previously, there was no basis to think that tobacco packets would be packed as the Bundles were. The Accused also could not provide details of the runner who had told him about the smuggling of tobacco. The Accused’s excuse that he did not check as he wanted to avoid accusations of theft and complaint from the customer was unbelievable given that he was running the risk of the death penalty. Given the suspicious circumstances, the Accused should have checked; he had the opportunity to ask and the opportunity to check.
[note: 20]
14     The present case was different from the case of 
Public Prosecutor v Phuthita Somchit and another
 
[2011] 3 SLR 719
 (“
Somchit
”), cited by the Defence. In that case, the duration of relationship was some 1.5 years; with the parties discussing marriage; and there was interaction with the family.
[note: 21]
 It was also different from the case of 
Khor Soon Lee v Public Prosecutor
 
[2011] 3 SLR 201
 (“
Khor Soon Lee
)”, in which there was friendship for about a year and the accused there met the person he trusted on a weekly basis.
[note: 22]
 Instead, the present case bore factual similarities with 
Norasharee bin Gous v Public Prosecutor and another appeal and another matter
 
[2017] 1 SLR 820
 (“
Norasharee
”), in which it was found that there was insufficient basis for the supposed trust.
[note: 23]
 In particular, the trust that the Accused placed in Aya was unbelievable. Aya was involved in illegal activities as a drug syndicate leader. The Accused alleged that his suspicion was not aroused as the Bundles were wrapped with multiple layers and he had complied with directions from Aya whom he trusted. But the failure to check was significant as his suspicion should have been aroused when he saw the contents of one of the Bundles through a gap in its wrappings.
[note: 24]
15     The prior conduct of the Accused also indicated that the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA was not rebutted. The Accused was working for Aya, 
ie
, a drug boss, and had consumed “ice” ahead of the transportation to ease his fear of getting caught.
[note: 25]
16     Further, the Accused admitted to having knowledge of the nature of the drugs in his contemporaneous and cautioned statements. In the contemporaneous statement, the recorder, Senior Staff Sergeant Samir bin Haroon (“SSSgt Samir”) spoke to the Accused in Malay and the Accused stated that “[d]rugs were found”. In his cautioned statement recorded by ASP Laurence Seow (“ASP Seow”) using English, the Accused also admitted to bringing drugs into Singapore. The contemporaneous and cautioned statements were properly recorded under ss 22 and 23 of the CPC respectively.
[note: 26]
17     Various allegations made by the Defence about impropriety in the recording of the statements should be rejected.
[note: 27]
 The Accused claimed in court that he had been suffering from drug withdrawal symptoms at the time the statements were taken, that he was not conversant in the languages used, and that the statements had not been read back to him. None of these was substantiated. The Accused was, according to the recorders, conversant in Malay and English.
[note: 28]
 Bad grades in school were relied upon by the Defence, but in the Accused’s interview with the psychiatrist, the Accused admitted that he had previously helped Aya with English translation. In the statements and at trial, the Accused also admitted that he spoke English and Malay for 11 years, and could speak in Tamil, Malay and English.
[note: 29]
18     Furthermore, there was nothing to make out any withdrawal symptoms suffered by the Accused at the time that the statements were taken. Instead, the evidence revealed that the Accused appeared normal and calm during the statement recording process. The Accused was also inconsistent as to when he suffered from these alleged withdrawal symptoms. It was initially claimed that the withdrawal symptoms were suffered from 10 November 2014 but then it was later alleged that he suffered this earlier during the recording of the contemporaneous and cautioned statements on 6 and 7 November 2014. In any event, his claims of withdrawal symptoms were rebutted by the medical evidence.
[note: 30]
 Similarly, there was no failure to have the statements read back to the Accused, as testified by SSSgt Samir and ASP Seow.
[note: 31]
19     The evidence showed that the Accused had independently identified the Bundles as drugs, without the aid of any identification of the drugs by the CNB officers. The Accused claimed that he had identified the Bundles as drugs in his statements only because the CNB officers tore open two of the Bundles and informed him that drugs were found. There were, however, inconsistencies and embellishments in the Accused’s version. There were no signs of tampering of the Bundles and none of the Bundles were in fact torn. The Accused was also not able to properly identify the officers who were supposedly responsible for showing him the contents of the Bundles. Additionally, these allegations were not put to the Prosecution’s witnesses by the Defence, contrary to the rule in 
Browne v Dunn
 (1893) 6 R 67 (“
Browne v Dunn
”).
[note: 32]
20     The case of 
Public Prosecutor v Gobi a/l Avedian
 
[2017] SGHC 145
 (“
Gobi
”), cited by the Defence to argue that the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA was rebutted, was distinguishable as the accused in that case had been consistent throughout and his account was corroborated. In the present case, in contrast, there were inconsistencies between the various statements given and the Accused’s position at trial, in terms of what was being transported and the amount of reward promised for the delivery. The Defence was unable to explain these inconsistences. Its case was founded on bare assertions only.
[note: 33]
21     While the Defence sought instead a conviction of the Accused for the importation of Class C controlled drugs, there was not only no evidence supporting this alternative defence at all, and it was also wholly inconsistent with the defence proffered during the trial.
[note: 34]
22     The Accused also failed to state his defence in his statements, entitling the court to draw an adverse inference pursuant to s 261(1) of the CPC. The Accused said that he was not asked to provide his defence, but this excuse was contradicted by his own testimony in court.
[note: 35]
The Defence’s case 
23     The Defence’s sole case was that the Accused lacked the knowledge that he was transporting controlled drugs – he thought that he was only transporting tobacco.
[note: 36]
 The Defence pointed to the following assurances and representations made by Aya, whom the Accused deeply trusted:
[note: 37]
(a)     the Accused would only be transporting tobacco;
(b)     in the event that the Accused was arrested, the custodial sentence would not exceed a few months; and
(c)     the Accused should not open the Bundles because the customers might complain that the packets were open and suspect that the Accused might have stolen some tobacco.
The Accused’s suspicion was also not aroused because there was no smell emanating from the Bundles.
[note: 38]
24     The Defence argued that the Accused did not admit in his statements that he knew that the drugs were cannabis or derivatives of cannabis. There was no independent identification of the Bundles containing drugs – the Accused used the word “drugs” in his statements because some of the Bundles were opened by the CNB officers and was informed by them that they contained drugs. In fact, one of the CNB officers, SSSgt Samir, accepted that this was the possible explanation for the Accused’s word choice. The Accused had no knowledge that the Bundles contained drugs because he could not see through the Bundles as they were wrapped.
[note: 39]
25     Overall, the Defence submitted that the Accused had successfully rebutted the presumption of knowledge of the nature of the drugs under s 18(2) of the MDA. There is no fixed formula for such rebuttal.
[note: 40]
 The Accused had been assured by Aya that he would be delivering tobacco, a position that the Accused consistently maintained from the time of his arrest to his evidence at trial. Accordingly, the Accused’s version should be preferred because he was a truthful and consistent witness.
[note: 41]
26     Lastly, citing the outcome reached in 
Gobi
, the Defence argued that the Accused should, in the alternative, be convicted for importing a Class C controlled drug.
[note: 42]
The decision 
27     In the present case, the Defence did not dispute the identity of the drugs found in the Bundles – the drug analysis, chain of custody, and integrity of the process were all not challenged. The act of importation was also not in issue: the drugs in question were driven into Singapore by the Accused. As the Accused admitted to driving the Car into Singapore, possession of the drugs by him was not in issue by virtue of s 18(1) of the MDA.
28     Instead, what was hotly disputed was whether the Accused knew that what he was carrying in the Bundles was controlled drugs. The Prosecution invoked s 18(2) of the MDA, 
ie
, an accused is presumed to have known the nature of the drugs he possessed. As a result, the burden lay on the Accused to show, on a balance of probabilities, that he did not in fact know of the nature of the drugs.
29     The Prosecution pointed to the contemporaneous and cautioned statements made by the Accused in which references were made to “drugs” being transported; this, it was said, showed the Accused’s knowledge. The Defence, on the other hand, argued that these references followed on from the Accused having been shown the contents of the Bundles and his being told that the Bundles contained drugs by the CNB officers.
30     I was not satisfied that the Accused’s reference to drugs showed pre-existing knowledge. I accepted that there was a real possibility that his usage of the term “drugs” flowed from what he was shown or told by the CNB officers.
31     That conclusion, however, did not lead to the result that the Accused did not know of the nature of the drugs. The Defence still had to make this out on a balance of probabilities. The Defence pointed to the trust that the Accused reposed in Aya, and the various assurances given by Aya to the Accused (see [23] above). Parallels were drawn with a number of cases such as 
Somchit
 and 
Khor Soon Lee
. However, these cases are distinguishable in terms of the degree of trust, and the circumstances giving rise to such trust. I accepted the Prosecution’s arguments that the Accused’s relationship with Aya was not of the same level, being one of only a few months’ duration even by the Accused’s own account. Aya’s known activity in smuggling drugs should also have made the Accused wary of any assurances given by Aya. Even if Aya was indeed involved in both drug and tobacco smuggling, in the overall circumstances of the case, it was not believable for the Accused to just accept at face value what Aya had told him, 
ie
, that the Accused was delivering tobacco only.
32     Other surrounding circumstances, including the lack of control over the Car and its contents overnight, and the measures taken in respect of the Car such as the fact that it had to be rented and the tinting of its windows, should have raised concerns which would have weakened substantially any assurance that was supposedly given. There was also the reward promised of S$5,000, agreed to by the Defence in the ASOF,
[note: 43]
 which was significantly higher than the sale value of tobacco of that quantity, which, according to the Accused’s own evidence, was RM7,000. While the Accused gave a lower figure for his reward of RM2,000 at trial, his explanation for the change of figure from the ASOF was left wanting. Even if the quantum of his reward was only RM2,000, that was still a significant amount for a delivery of tobacco supposedly worth RM7,000.
33     Furthermore, given the available opportunities for the Accused to check and verify the contents of the Bundle with Aya and the absence of any reasonable basis for the Accused to rely on the assurances from and any relationship with Aya, I found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the Accused did actually know that the Bundles contained the controlled drugs for which he was charged with.
Analysis 
34     Following the Court of Appeal’s decision in 
Ng Kwok Chun and another v Public Prosecutor
 
[1992] 3 SLR(R) 256
, the elements of a charge for importation into Singapore of a controlled drug under s 7 of the MDA are (at [39]):
(a)     the bringing of the drugs into Singapore; and
(b)     the accused knew or intended to bring the drugs into Singapore.
On the second limb, the relevant 
mens rea
 in this case was that of knowledge. This requires that the accused knows that he was bringing drugs and that these drugs were being brought into Singapore. Knowledge that drugs were being brought in requires knowledge of the nature of what was being brought in.
Bringing into Singapore 
35     The Defence did not challenge the 
actus reus
 of the element of importation. The Accused was, on his own version, bringing the Bundles into Singapore; he just thought that he was transporting tobacco instead. The Bundles, containing the drugs, were hidden in the Car by the Accused himself.
Knowledge that drugs were brought into Singapore
36     While there was no issue that Singapore was the intended destination of the Bundles being smuggled in, the controversy between the parties was whether the Accused knew at the material time that the Bundles contained controlled drugs.
Knowledge of the nature of the drugs
37     After careful consideration of the evidence and the parties’ submission, I found that the Accused had actual knowledge that he was carrying drugs, 
ie
, the cannabis and cannabis mixture, as charged. The Prosecution invoked the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA. I found that the evidence disclosed showed actual knowledge, including wilful blindness; and that in any event, the evidence also led to the conclusion that the s 18(2) presumption was not rebutted. But as the Prosecution proceeded on the basis of the statutory presumption, whether the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA was rebutted will be considered first, before turning to the issue of actual knowledge and wilful blindness.
The presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA 
38     Section 18(2) of the MDA provides for a presumption of knowledge of the nature of the drug:
Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have known the nature of that drug.
39     Where the presumption under s 18(2) applies, this has to be rebutted by the accused on the balance of probabilities: see 
Muhammad Ridzuan bin Md Ali v Public Prosecutor and other matters
 
[2014] 3 SLR 721
 at [75] and 
Public Prosecutor v Ilechukwu Chukwudi
 
[2015] SGCA 33
 (“
Ilechukwu
”) at [30], referring to 
Nagaenthran a/l K Dharmalingam v Public Prosecutor
 
[2011] 4 SLR 1156
 at [31].
40     The Defence argued that the Accused’s version, 
ie
, he had only agreed to bring in tobacco into Singapore, was credible and established on the balance of probabilities. In particular, the presumption of knowledge was rebutted in light of:
[note: 44]
(a)     the relationship between Aya and the Accused; and
(b)     the fact that a credible and consistent account had been given of how the Accused came to be arrested with the Bundles.
41     A rebuttal may be established if the accused is able to show that “he did not know or could not reasonably be expected to have known the nature of the controlled drug”: 
Dinesh Pillai a/l K Raja Retnam v Public Prosecutor
 
[2012] 2 SLR 903
 at [18]. As explained by the Court of Appeal in 
Obeng Comfort
, referring to 
Masoud Rahimi bin Mehrzad v Public Prosecutor and another appeal
 
[2017] 1 SLR 257
:
37    …. The court assesses the accused’s evidence as to his subjective knowledge by comparing it with what an ordinary, reasonable person would have known or done if placed in the same situation that the accused was in. If such an ordinary, reasonable person would surely have known or taken steps to establish the nature of the drug in question, 
the accused would have to adduce evidence to persuade the court that nevertheless he, for reasons special to himself or to his situation, did not have such knowledge or did not take such steps.
...
39    In a case where the accused is seeking to rebut the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA, as a matter of common sense and practical application, he should be able to say what he thought or believed he was carrying, particularly when the goods have to be carried across international borders as they could be prohibited goods or goods which are subject to tax. 
It would not suffice for the accused to claim simply that he did not know what he was carrying save that he did not know or think it was drugs
. If such a simplistic claim could rebut the presumption in s 18(2), the presumption would be all bark and no bite. …
[emphasis added]
42     Here, of course the Accused did claim that he thought the Bundles contained something else, 
ie
, tobacco. However, the guidance from the Court of Appeal in 
Obeng Comfort
 goes further (at [40]):
Where the accused has stated what he thought he was carrying (“the purported item”), 
the court will assess the veracity of his assertion against the objective facts and examine his actions relating to the purported item
. This assessment will naturally be a highly fact-specific inquiry. For example, the court will generally consider the nature, the value and the quantity of the purported item and any reward for transporting such an item. If it is an ordinary item that is easily available in the country receipt, the court would want to know why it was necessary for him to transport it from another country. If it is a perishable or fragile item, the court would consider whether steps were taken to preserve it or to prevent damage to it. If it is a precious item, the court would consider whether steps were taken to keep it safe from loss through theft or otherwise. If it is a dangerous item, the court would consider how the item was packed and handled. Ultimately, 
what the court is concerned with is the credibility and veracity of the accused’s account (ie, whether his assertion that he did not know the nature of the drugs is true).
 This depends not only on the credibility of the accused as a witness but also on how believable his account relating to the purported item is.
[emphasis added]
43     Thus, the version proffered by the Accused must be tested against the probabilities of the situation and the objective evidence.
(1)   The relationship with Aya
44     The Defence maintained that the Accused was entitled to rely on what Aya had told him because of their relationship. It was argued that this was similar to the case of 
Somchit
. However, as argued by the Prosecution, the relationship and trust between the accused and the person who gave instructions to the accused in that case was of a markedly different level.
[note: 45]
 In that case, the accused, Somchit, relied on her relationship with one Quek, to justify her claim that she did not know that she was handling heroin or diamorphine. The parties in 
Somchit
 had known each other for almost one and a half years; they were in a romantic relationship with discussions about marriage; Quek gave Somchit a monthly allowance; Quek was in direct contact with Somchit’s family and even arranged for her nephew to work for him in Singapore. These indicated a level of connection and interaction of a very great degree: they were in effect a couple, though not married. There was nothing of that nature between the Accused and Aya in the present case.
45     The present case also differed from 
Khor Soon Lee
. There the accused, Khor, had trusted one Tony as to what Khor was to carry into Singapore as well. But the relationship between Khor and Tony lasted for a year, with weekly meetings. They were, as the Court of Appeal there found, in “a friendly relationship” (
Khor Soon Lee
 at [25]), justifying trust. Crucially, the Court of Appeal opined that the facts in 
Khor Soon Lee
 were “rather unusual” and saw it fit for the following “strong cautionary note … to be sounded” (at [29]):
… Given the finely balanced set of facts in the present appeal, 
nothing in this case sets a precedent for future cases
 (which ought, in any event, to turn on their own particular facts). Still less will future courts countenance accused persons seeking to ‘manufacture defences’ in order to effect a similar fact pattern.
[emphasis added]
46     A case in contrast was cited by the Prosecution: 
Norasharee
. An allegation of trust being reposed by the accused there was rejected by the Court of Appeal as the object of that trust was involved in “a spectrum of illegal activities”, had previously threatened to beat the accused, and had shown himself to be “untrustworthy” (at [50]).
47     In my judgment, the line between these cases is drawn simply on the basis that the relationship of trust must be one that is credible on the facts as alleged; where the description of the alleged relationship contains incongruities, the likely result will be that the version proffered by the accused will be rejected and the presumption will remain unrebutted. But where the description of the relationship is coherent, credible and there is nothing to cast doubt on what is testified, the court will conclude that there is sufficient support for the accused’s version and that the presumption has been rebutted on the balance of probabilities.
48     In the present case, there was insufficient basis on the Accused’s own version for him to have reposed trust in Aya that all he was smuggling into Singapore was tobacco. First, there was little basis for the Accused to repose much trust in Aya because the Accused only knew Aya through a “friend’s friend” three months before the incident.
[note: 46]
 Second, the Accused admitted that he knew that Aya was a “drug syndicate leader” who organised the importation of drugs into Singapore.
[note: 47]
 Third, Aya had in fact initially asked the Accused to smuggle drugs to Singapore.
[note: 48]
 Taken together, these factors should have made the Accused wary, if not, chary, of any contraband item which Aya would have paid the Accused to bring into Singapore given the circumstances of the request and their relationship. In the circumstances, the Accused’s reposing of trust in Aya defied credit.
49     Against that context, the failure of the Accused to check the contents of the Bundles was also significant. There was nothing to support the passive posture purportedly taken by the Accused – all the circumstances pointed against the reposing of trust, and therefore active steps should have been taken to assure himself that what he thought was true. That the Accused did not check, despite these circumstances, militated in favour of rejecting his version.
(2)   Reward for smuggling 
50     The reward supposedly offered by Aya to the Accused to smuggle the tobacco was also disproportionately significant. As alluded to above at [32], there was a dispute as to the amount of reward actually offered. However, in the ASOF, which had been agreed to and signed by the Defence, there was a reference to the Accused receiving S$5,000. There was no move to have the ASOF set aside; in the circumstances, therefore, the ASOF was conclusive. Furthermore, even if there had been such an attempt, there was nothing before me to justify any such setting aside of the ASOF – short of the Accused being misled or misapprehending what he had agreed to, it is difficult to fathom what other grounds would justify discarding the ASOF.
51     Further, several other aspects rendered the Accused’s version incredulous. A car was 
specifically rented
 for the delivery even though the Accused already drove a car at the material time, which he used while serving as a personal driver of Aya.
[note: 49]
 The Accused also admitted at trial that this was “the 
first time
” [emphasis added] he had to rent a car for his delivery
[note: 50]
 even though he had previously made several other trips to Singapore in the course of working for Aya.
[note: 51]
 The Accused also took the Car to a workshop to have its windows tinted without asking Aya of the reasons for doing so even though this was the 
first time
 Aya had asked the Accused to tint a car.
[note: 52]
 Further, even though the Car was parked at the Accused’s estate, the keys to the Car were held overnight by Aya and only passed to the Accused by Aya’s relative the next morning.
[note: 53]
 All of these, on top of the Accused having to conceal the Bundles in the Car, would seem to be too disproportionate to the smuggling of tobacco that was to be sold for about RM7,000 or so in Singapore.
[note: 54]
 If anything, these additional measures, which involved particular effort and money being expended, should have made the Accused wary had he really thought that he was merely smuggling tobacco.
52     The failure of the Accused to mention this version in his cautioned statement was also another factor that pointed to the rejection of his version, and thus to his failure to rebut the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA. Section 261(1) of the CPC reads:
 
Inferences from accused’s silence
 
 
261.
—(1) Where in any criminal proceeding evidence is given that the accused on being charged with an offence, or informed by a police officer or any other person charged with the duty of investigating offences that he may be prosecuted for an offence, 
failed to mention any fact which he subsequently relies on in his defence
, being a fact which in the circumstances existing at the time he could reasonably have been expected to mention when so questioned, charged or informed, as the case may be, the court may in determining —
(
a
)    whether to commit the accused for trial;
(
b
)    whether there is a case to answer; and
(c)     
whether the accused is guilty of the offence charged
,
 
draw such inferences from the failure as appear proper
; and the failure may, on the basis of those inferences, be treated as, or as capable of amounting to, corroboration of any evidence given against the accused in relation to which the failure is material.
[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]
The Accused should have mentioned his defence upon being cautioned: see 
Ilechukwu
 at [52]. It would have been reasonable for him to have raised his version of the story, particularly that he thought he was carrying tobacco. That he did not do so, gave rise to the inference that this was not the truth and was merely an afterthought.
53     No explanation was given by the Accused for this failure, other than that he was not asked.
[note: 55]
 That was not a sufficient explanation at all. The Accused, in response to a question as to why he had admitted in his cautioned statement that he had brought drugs into Singapore, said that he was sleepy and intoxicated at the time he gave that statement.
[note: 56]
 As will be seen below (at [69]), I rejected the allegation that he was not fit to give his statement. But aside from that, if he had been able to respond as he actually did regarding the reasons why he had given an adverse response in an earlier statement, he would also have reasonably been expected to explain and recount why he had thought that he was bringing tobacco into Singapore or at the very least state this defence upon being cautioned. This he did not do.
54     For these reasons, I found that the Defence failed to rebut on the balance of probabilities the presumption of knowledge of the nature of drugs that arose under s 18(2) of the MDA.
Actual knowledge 
55     The above conclusions on the Accused’s failure to rebut the s 18(2) presumption were also grounds for finding actual knowledge, 
ie
, the deficiencies in the Accused’s evidence above also pointed to the conclusion that even apart from the statutory presumption, the Accused was not able to raise a reasonable doubt as to his knowledge of the nature of the drugs.
56     In assessing the evidence as to whether the Accused actually knew that what he was transporting were drugs, the Prosecution need only prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, not beyond any shadow or trace of doubt. What amounts to reasonable doubt is usually more readily assessed from the perspective of the accused person, 
ie
, whether he has raised a reasonable doubt. On occasion, the reasonable doubt may be readily found where the Prosecution’s evidence is insufficiently strong, though all the elements of the charge are made out, there may be significant doubts about the credibility of the witnesses, for instance, or the chain of inferences pointing to the guilt of the accused. In these instances, there may be little need for the accused to do more than to raise questions about the Prosecution’s evidence. However, in other contexts, where the Prosecution has more substantive evidence, the accused, to raise a reasonable doubt, needs to put before the court some evidence. All the evidence, from both sides, is then assessed by the court, and a determination is ultimately made. If the Prosecution’s evidence is cogent and convincing, and meets the requisite standard, the accused is convicted.
57     In the present case, the evidence recounted above, particularly the circumstances of the transaction, such as the preparations made in respect of the concealment of the Bundles, the steps taken to prepare the rented Car by tinting the windows, and the handing over of the Car keys to Aya overnight, indubitably pointed against the Bundles containing only tobacco.
58     The reward of S$5,000 offered to the Accused
[note: 57]
 also showed that the Accused was, on his own evidence, being asked to transport items of worth. It was also noteworthy that the amount to be paid to the Accused was significantly more than what was supposed to be the cost of ten packets of tobacco. The circumstances leading up to the transporting of the contraband in Singapore were, as described by the Prosecution, “incongruous”:
[note: 58]
(a)     the preparations were extensive;
(b)     the Car was tinted;
(c)     the Bundles were hidden away; and
(d)     the Car keys kept overnight by Aya.
The amount of effort undertaken in preparation for the delivery was remarkably disproportionate if it had truly been smuggling of tobacco only. These went beyond what would be expected in the typical smuggling of non-narcotic contraband.
59     Taken together with the Accused’s own statement that he knew that Aya was involved in drug trafficking, all the circumstances pointed to the Accused knowing that he was transporting controlled drugs.
60     The Accused knew that there were items hidden in the Car that he was driving into Singapore. The present case was not one in which the Accused denied all knowledge that he was carrying contraband. The Accused, knowing that there was contraband, had to raise a reasonable doubt about his knowledge of the nature of that contraband. The evidential burden lay upon him to adduce evidence that would have such an effect. His testimony, however, was at best not believable, and, at worst, incongruous.
61     Given the rejection of the Defence’s version, what was left was only the version put forward by the Prosecution, namely, that the Accused knew that he was carrying Class A controlled drugs into Singapore. Nothing else was at all plausible on the facts such as to have raised a reasonable doubt.
Wilful blindness 
62     Wilful blindness is a form of actual knowledge: see 
Tan Kiam Peng v Public Prosecutor
 
[2008] 1 SLR(R) 1
 at [133]–[134] and 
Obeng Comfort
 at [41].
63     The circumstances discussed above also pointed towards wilful blindness being made out. The Accused worked for Aya, as a bodyguard and driver, knew that Aya dealt in drugs, collected drug money for him and even smoked “ice” with him. Taken together with the elaborate preparations noted above (at [58]), carrying hidden contraband goods for smuggling in this context should have triggered a very high degree of suspicion on the Accused’s part. His decision not to inquire further, or to check, the contents of the Bundle could only be indicative of a desire not to uncover what he must have already known – the Accused was therefore wilfully blind.
The statements made by the Accused
64     To be clear, I did not in my conclusions rely on the references to “drugs” made in the contemporaneous and cautioned statements given by the Accused. While I did not accept some of the arguments made by the Defence in respect of these statements, I did accept that there was sufficient ambiguity such that it was unsafe to rely on these to show the Accused’s knowledge that he was carrying drugs.
65     The Prosecution invoked two statements of the Accused as showing that he had known at the material time that he was carrying drugs: these were the contemporaneous and cautioned statements under ss 22 and 23 of the CPC respectively.
[note: 59]
 The contemporaneous statement dated 6 November 2014 recorded by SSSgt Samir, went as follows:
[note: 60]
Q2)
Earlier when you were stopped, what was found in your car?
A2)
Drugs were found.
Q3)
How many of the drugs were found?
A3)
There were 10 bundles.
Q4)
Do you know what drugs are those?
A4)
I do not know what drugs, but I know they are drugs.
66     The cautioned statement dated 7 November 2014 was recorded by ASP Seow. ASP Seow recorded what the Accused said in answer to the warning under s 23 of the CPC as follows:
[note: 61]
I admit to bringing drugs into Singapore. I would rather die than be in prison for life sentence.
67     While the Accused did not allege involuntariness, the Accused alleged that there was improper recording as he was not fluent in either Malay, which was the language in which the contemporaneous statement was recorded, or English, which was the language in which the cautioned statement was recorded. The recorders denied that there had been any difficulty in communication, maintaining that the Accused was able to converse with them, and they had in any event asked the Accused what language he wanted to use.
[note: 62]
68     The Accused tried to show that he had difficulties with both English and Malay languages, relying on his poor school results.
[note: 63]
 However, as noted by the Prosecution, his school results dated back to 2003, more than 11 years before the offences were committed.
[note: 64]
 Given that he lived in Malaysia, and had in fact at some point transported foreigners from Johor Bahru to Singapore for a living,
[note: 65]
 I found it hard to believe that even if his command of Malay and English had been poor in school during examinations, that there would not have been the opportunity and incentive to improve them over his adult and working life.
69     The Accused also invoked drug withdrawal symptoms at the time the statements were taken. This was not supported by the medical examination conducted – Dr Mithran Kukanesen examined the Accused on 6 and 7 November 2014 (
ie
, the dates when the relevant statements were recorded) and did not observe any drug withdrawal symptoms.
[note: 66]
 Additionally, two doctors, who examined the Accused on 8 and 9 November 2014 respectively, gave statements that the Accused was not suffering from any drug withdrawal symptoms.
[note: 67]
 Another doctor also testified that the Accused was alert, coherent, conscious and responsive as of the assessment on 10 November 2014.
[note: 68]
 In any event, this point was not strongly pursued by the Defence in its submissions.
70     The argument was also made that the statements were not recorded in compliance with the requirements of the CPC, in that the statements had not been read back to the Accused. There was nothing to show any reasonable doubt as to this: the recorders of these statements were not cross-examined on this matter. Neither was there anything compelling in the evidence of the Accused on this score. In any event, any non-compliance with the requirements does not necessarily lead to non-admissibility of the evidence: see Explanation 2, paragraph (
e
) to s 258 of the CPC. While the Court of Appeal in 
Muhammad bin Kadar v Public Prosecutor
 
[2011] 3 SLR 1205
 held that a residual discretion exists to exclude improperly recorded statements if its prejudicial effect exceeded its probative value, there was nothing in the present case to show that.
71     However, as regards the more pertinent question of whether the statements showed that the Accused knew that the Bundles contained drugs, I was not satisfied that the statements pointed to this. There was ambiguity as the Accused could have used the term “drugs” in response to what he had perceived or heard from the CNB officers. It would have been otherwise had there been explicit or specific questions asking whether he knew or how he knew that the Bundles contained drugs. As it was, however, I was left with the statements on the one hand, and the distinct possibility that the Accused said what he said because he had been told by the CNB officers that the Bundles contained drugs.
72     The Prosecution tried to head off this conclusion, arguing that the Accused independently identified the packages as containing drugs.
[note: 69]
 However, the Prosecution’s submissions pointed instead to supposed inconsistences and embellishments in the Accused’s evidence which were alleged to render his evidence unreliable. In this regard, it was argued that the Accused was not able to properly and consistently identify the CNB officers who had supposedly torn open the Bundles and informed him of the contents; the Accused was also unable to identify the torn Bundles or how extensive the tearing was.
[note: 70]
73     It may be that these are points that could be against the Accused, but they do not establish that the Accused actually admitted to knowledge of the drugs through what he had said in his statements. As alluded to above (at [71]), the ambiguity was inherent in the words used in the statement. Any inconsistency or other shortcomings in the Accused’s evidence could not establish that the Accused had by what he said admitted to having knowledge of the Bundles’ contents. Even if he had lied, that would not establish the 
ex ante
 fact of knowledge.
74     The Prosecution also argued that the Defence failed to corroborate the Accused’s assertions.
[note: 71]
 This too could not take the Prosecution very far. The ambiguity in what was recorded in the statements could not be cured by any absence of corroboration. Similarly, the Prosecution’s invocation of 
Browne v Dunn
,
[note: 72]
 whilst perhaps technically correct, could not exclude an interpretation of the statements relied upon by the Prosecution itself.
75     In the circumstances, I could not give weight to these statements insofar as they were relied upon to show the Accused’s knowledge of the nature of the drugs at the material time. There was sufficient doubt raised by the Defence that the Accused had mentioned “[d]rugs were found” only because he had witnessed what the CNB officers had found and/or told him after unwrapping the Bundles. I accordingly attached no weight to the statements as showing the Accused’s knowledge of the drugs.
Alternative charge
76     While the alternative argument made by the Defence contended that the Accused should be convicted of transporting Class C controlled drugs, there was nothing in his evidence alleging any belief or knowledge that he was involved with that lower class of drugs as opposed to Class A controlled drugs. The Defence’s arguments appeared to be inspired by the alternative conviction in cases such as 
Gobi
 or 
Khor Soon Lee
. But the circumstances in those cases were different. In 
Khor Soon Lee
, the Court of Appeal agreed with the Defence, based on a consistent pattern of conduct that was adduced by the accused, that the accused would only transport drugs which did not carry the risk of death penalty (at [27] and [29]). Similarly in 
Gobi
, an assurance had been given that the drugs were only “chocolate”, 
ie
, less serious drugs. As the trial judge in 
Gobi
 accepted the version given by the accused there (at [34]), the reduction of the charge to a Class C controlled drug followed. In contrast, in the present case, there was simply no evidence that the Accused believed that he was carrying a 
less serious drug
. Here, there was only a binary choice: either the Accused knew he was carrying cannabis and cannabis mixture, or he did not. Having failed to make out the latter to rebut the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA, the inexorable conclusion was that the Accused knew that he was carrying Class A controlled drugs.
77     For the foregoing reasons, the Accused was convicted of the two charges as framed.
Sentence
78     For the purpose of sentencing, it was not disputed that the Accused’s involvement in the transaction was limited only to the transportation, sending, or delivery of a controlled drug. I therefore found the Accused to be a courier within the meaning of s 33B(2)(
a
) of the MDA. Further, as the Accused was granted a certificate of substantive assistance by the Prosecution under s 33B(2)(
b
) of the MDA, he was eligible to be sentenced under s 33B(1)(
a
) of the MDA to imprisonment for life and caning of not less than 15 strokes for each of the charges, instead of capital punishment.
79     The Defence’s oral mitigation stated that the Accused had become involved in the transaction because he had to borrow money from Aya to pay for his son’s medical treatment. It was also highlighted that he had cooperated with the police and that he was heretofore untraced. The Defence thus submitted for the minimum sentence possible.
[note: 73]
 The Prosecution left sentencing to the court and made no further submissions.
[note: 74]
80     In my judgment, there was nothing on the facts to indicate that the court should impose capital punishment rather life imprisonment. Accordingly, life imprisonment was imposed for each of the two charges and the sentences were to run concurrently, with effect from the date of remand, 
ie
, 8 November 2014. As for caning, as there were no other factors pointing to the need for a heavier punishment, I imposed the minimum number of strokes per charge, which was 15 (see s 33B(1)(
a
) of the MDA). This took the total to 30 strokes of the cane for the two charges, above the maximum permitted under s 328(6) of the CPC. The order was thus made for the statutory maximum of 24 strokes to be imposed.
Conclusion
81     For the above reasons, I found the Accused guilty of the two charges as framed, and in light of my discretion to sentence the Accused under s 33B(1)(
a
) of the MDA and in the absence of any aggravating factors, I imposed a global sentence of life imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane.

 District Judge Chiah Kok Khun:
 
INTRODUCTION
 
1       “
Sweet Haven
” (“the Vessel”) was a fully-decked fibreglass cabin cruiser owned by the Plaintiff, Mr Cheong Chung Kin. It was a luxury yacht measuring 10.9m in length, with a capacity of 12 passengers.
[note: 1]
 The Vessel was customarily moored at One Degree 15 Marina at Sentosa (“the Marina”). The Defendants are partners of and trading as Swift Integrated Marine Services which operated out of the Marina and provided services to the pleasure boat owners at the Marina. There is some disagreement as to the extent of the firm’s services to the boat owners and this will be revisited below. However, it is not disputed that at the least, the firm provided cleaning and maintenance services to boat owners, including the Plaintiff.
[note: 2]
 The 1
st
 Defendant, Mr David Sim Teck Seang is the partner in charge of the firm. He was the person who interacted with the Plaintiff; and the 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 Defendants did not appear to have directly played a part in the events leading up to the claim in this case.
2       In the night of 13 November 2013, the Vessel was on the way back to the Marina from an outlying islet, Lazarus Island. The Plaintiff was piloting the Vessel. Whilst so underway, the Vessel met with a suspected grounding incident. The Plaintiff detected what he described as a “grinding” sensation.
[note: 3]
 He thought the Vessel’s underwater hull might be damaged. The port engine was vibrating after the incident. The Plaintiff had to rely only on the starboard engine to sail the Vessel into the Marina. Nevertheless, the Vessel returned safely to shore.
3       Back at the Marina, the Plaintiff examined the transom floor and detected no sign of water ingress. He inspected the engine room and found that it was dry.
[note: 4]
 The Plaintiff wanted the Vessel to be investigated to determine if there was damage; and if repairs were needed. He called the 1
st
 Defendant who met him at the Marina. He asked the 1
st
 Defendant to do a check on the Vessel. The 1
st
 Defendant conducted a physical check of the Vessel in the morning of 14 November 2013. No visible damage was discovered. He then instructed an underwater hull cleaner to don snooker mask to inspect the underwater hull. The hull cleaner found the port rudder and propellers bent. The 1
st
 Defendant started the engine and noted vibrations.
[note: 5]
 The 1
st
 Defendant informed the Plaintiff that to properly examine the underwater hull, the Vessel would have to be up slipped. There was unfortunately, and perhaps surprisingly, no facilities at the Marina to up slip the Vessel.
[note: 6]
 There were however facilities to do so at the Marina Country Club at Punggol (“Punggol”). The 1
st
 Defendant discussed with the Plaintiff the options to move the Vessel to Punggol.
[note: 7]
 The Plaintiff was leaving Singapore on 14 November 2013 for a work trip. He asked the 1
st
 Defendant to help make arrangements to send the Vessel from the Marina to Punggol for the Vessel to be up slipped for investigation.
[note: 8]
4       The voyage from the Marina to Punggol took place on 15 November 2013. It turned out to be the Vessel’s last. At about 11.45am the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 Defendants, together with the skipper, Mr Md Mus Mulyadi Bin Md Salim and a crew member, Mr Lai Kah Jun sailed the Vessel from the Marina towards Punggol. The skipper and the crew member were engaged by the Defendants to pilot the Vessel. Extra pumps were brought on board for the voyage. Only the starboard engine was operating as the port engine was faulty. After about 20 minutes of sailing, and before the Vessel reached Outer Shoal Beacon, water started seeping into the engine room portside floorboard. All the pumps were activated to rid the Vessel of water. However water continued to enter the Vessel. On the skipper’s orders, all on board had to don lift vests and abandon ship. At about 12.20pm, “
Sweet Haven
” sank. The crew were in the water for about 15 minutes before they were rescued by a passing vessel.

THE PLAINTIFF’S CLAIM
 
5       The Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendants is for damages as a result of the loss of the Vessel. The Plaintiff is proceeding on two causes of action against the Defendants. One cause of action is in bailment and the other is in negligence. The quantum has been agreed. There was another cause of action, in contract, which the Plaintiff had pleaded but did not proceed with.
6       The claim is a subrogated action. The Plaintiff had taken the insurer of the Vessel, Tenet Sompo Insurance Pte Ltd (“Insurer”) to court on his claim under a marine insurance policy for the loss of the Vessel. The claim was settled. The Insurer then exercised its right of subrogation and commenced the present action in the name of the Plaintiff against the Defendants to recover the settlement sum paid to the Plaintiff. The Defendants pointed out that the Insurer steps into the shoes of the Plaintiff and its rights are those of the Plaintiff’s. There is no dispute that in law this must be so, and it does not appear to me that the Insurer has at any point in the case proceeded otherwise. The causes of action commenced against the Defendants in this case are those that could be and would be mounted by the Plaintiffs, as required in a subrogated claim.
 
ISSUES
 
7       As alluded to above, the Plaintiffs are proceeding with two causes of action against the Defendants, namely, bailment and tort of negligence. The Defendants deny liability under both causes of action. The primary issues in this case are therefore those in respect of these two causes of action. The Plaintiff has set out the issues and I agree that they are the issues pertinent to the determination of this case. The issues are as follows.
8       The issues in respect of the cause of action in bailment are as follows:
a.     Whether a bailment arose by reason of the Defendants taking possession of the Vessel for the sea voyage from the Marina to Punggol?
b.     Whether the bailment was a bailment for reward or a gratuitous bailment?
c.     Whether the Defendants as bailees had proven on a balance of probabilities that they had taken reasonable care of the Vessel and whether there was a breach of duty on the part of the Defendants?
9       In relation to the cause of action in the tort of negligence, the issues are as follows:-
a.     Whether the Defendants owed a duty of care to the Plaintiff to take reasonable care of the Vessel?
b.     What was the standard of care and whether the Defendants breached their duty of care?
10     There is also the factual question of what caused the Vessel to sink during its last voyage. The Defendants’ case is that the cause of the sinking of the Vessel is not attributable to them. In this regard, the Plaintiff has framed the issue of causation in the following manner:
Whether the Defendants’ failure to properly inspect the bottom of the Vessel and their subsequent decision to proceed with the sea voyage without properly ascertaining if the Vessel could safely sail from the Marina to Punggol, caused the Vessel to sink?
11     Finally, the Defendants contend that the task of moving the Vessel from Marina to Punggol was a personal act of the 1
st
 Defendant and the partnership is not liable for the 1
st
 Defendant’s personal act. There is therefore the additional issue of whether the Defendants are jointly and severally liable to the Plaintiff in the event that I find in favour of the Plaintiff in respect of his claim.
 
THE PLAINTIFF’S CLAIM IN BAILMENT
 
Whether a bailment arose by reason of the Defendants taking possession of the Vessel for the sea voyage from the Marina to Punggol?
12     The essence of bailment is the taking of possession of goods with an assumption of responsibility for the safe keeping of the goods. A bailment is said to arise when the bailee acquires exclusive possession of the chattel: 
Midland Silicones Ltd v Scruttons Ltd
 
[1959] 2 QB 171
, at 189. The Singapore High Court explained the underlying concept of bailment to involve the delivery of goods by the bailor to the bailee upon a trust under which the bailee undertakes to take reasonable care of the goods and to redeliver them to the bailor: see 
Chua Chye Leong Alan v Grand Palace De-luxe Nite Club Pte Ltd
 
[1993] 2 SLR(R) 420
 (“
Chua Chye Leong
”) at [39]. In 
Chua Chye Leong
, it was held that bailment was established when a car “jockey” took possession of the plaintiff’s car in order to park the car; and subsequently to return it to the plaintiff. The car owner had delivered and entrusted the car to the car “jockey” to take reasonable care of the car and it was held that a bailment subsisted. It would appear therefore that for a bailment to subsist, it must first be established that the goods in question were in the control and possession of the bailor. Second, it must be shown that there was an assumption of responsibility by the bailor for the safe keeping of the goods.
13     In the present case, it is not disputed by the 1
st
 Defendant that the Vessel was in the control and possession of the Defendants at the material time. The Plaintiff had to leave for overseas on business and he delivered and entrusted the Vessel to the Defendants. The Plaintiff signed an authorisation letter to authorise the Defendants to “
handle all matters pertaining to
” the Vessel.
[note: 10]
 This is consistent with the Plaintiff’s case that he had entrusted the Vessel to the Defendants’ possession. The Plaintiff’s evidence is that he made it clear that the Vessel had to be safe and that the Defendants had to make sure that they checked the Vessel before the Defendants sailed her from the Marina to Punggol.
[note: 11]
 It is plainly reasonable for the Plaintiff to expect that the Defendants would take reasonable care of the Vessel when she was in the Defendants’ possession and that the Defendants would redeliver the Vessel to the Plaintiff in safe condition. The Plaintiff stated that he was assuaged of his concerns for the safe handling of the Vessel when the 1
st
 Defendant told him that he had sent a person to check the underwater hull and no damage to the hull was reported.
[note: 12]
14     It is therefore indisputable that the Defendants had exclusive possession of the Vessel at the material time. The Defendants were authorised to handle all matters pertaining to the Vessel for purposes of its voyage to Punggol and back. The taking of possession of the Vessel in the circumstances set out above involved the assumption of responsibility on the part of the Defendants. The Plaintiff had a reasonable expectation that the Vessel would be safely conveyed from the Marina to Punggol and back. In the premises, the essence of bailment was established. A bailment arose by reason of the Defendants taking possession of the Vessel, where the Plaintiff was the bailor and the Defendants were the bailees.
Whether the bailment was a bailment for reward or a gratuitous bailment?
15     The next question is whether the bailment was one for reward or gratuitous. In a gratuitous bailment, no consideration passed from the bailor to the bailee. It has been held however, that to constitute a bailment for reward, it is not necessary that there should be an immediate or direct tangible benefit or advantage, such as a payment of a fee to the bailee: 
Chua Chye Leong
 at [40]. In 
Chua Chye Leong
¸ the defendants owned and operated a night club and provided car parking service to their customers for which no charge or fee was levied. The High Court held that was part of the services they had provided to their customers for coming to the night club. It was held that there was no doubt that they derived some benefit or advantage in the form of increased patronage to the night club. It was held that the bailment that arose from the car parking service was one for reward and not a gratuitous bailment. 
Chua Chye Leong
 followed the English cases of 
Murphy v Hard
 (1919) 46 DLR 36, and 
Way Sagless Springs Co Ltd v Bevradio Theatres Ltd
 [1942] 3 DLR 448. In 
Murphy v Hart
, a restaurateur, in whose custody articles of clothing were deposited temporarily and free of charge, was held liable as an ordinary bailee for reward for a loss. In 
Way Sagless Springs Co Ltd v Bevradio Theatres Ltd
, a theatre which provided free parking service for its patrons was also held to be liable as a bailee for reward. In both cases, the restaurateur and the theatre would benefit from an indirect advantage of having better future trade or patronage from their customers. A bailment for reward can thus be established even if the service was provided free of charge, so long as there is some indirect benefit advantage obtained by the bailee. The indirect benefit could be in the form of increased trade or business.
16     In the present case, there was a tangible benefit for the Defendants as it was admitted by the 1
st
 Defendant that he would have invoiced the Plaintiff.
[note: 13]
 At the same time, the Plaintiff stated that he expected to be invoiced and would have paid the invoiced fees for the Defendants’ service of bringing the Vessel from the Marina to Punggol.
[note: 14]
 There was in place a course of dealing where the Plaintiff had been paying the Defendants for maintenance and upkeep works on the Vessel.
[note: 15]
 These services rendered by the Defendants were provided ad hoc and the Defendants were always paid after the completion of the services. The 1
st
 Defendant confirmed in court that the Defendants usually invoiced their clients after the service was carried out as the price of the service was usually not fixed and would be haggled.
[note: 16]
 Moreover, the 1
st
 Defendant had said that the Defendants would only provide free services for “
very minor services
” and even minor services such as the topping up of engine oil would not be free but would be charged.
[note: 17]
 It was therefore unlikely that the Defendants would not have wanted to invoice the Plaintiff for sailing the Vessel from the Marina to Punggol. The engagement took an entire day.
[note: 18]
 The only reason why the Defendants did not invoice the Plaintiff was because the Defendants “
felt bad
” that the Vessel sank.
[note: 19]
 In the circumstances, in my view, the Defendants would have enjoyed a benefit in sailing the Vessel from the Marina to Punggol as the Plaintiff had every intention to pay if the Defendants had invoiced the Plaintiff. There was a tangible benefit to the Defendants, although it was not immediate.
17     Further, even if the service was provided solely as a gesture of goodwill and favour
[note: 20]
 it is likely that the Defendants intended such favour to be reciprocated in the form of further future patronage by the Plaintiff. It is unlikely that the Defendants would provide a full day of work involving a free-lance skipper and a mechanic without expecting any form of future reciprocation. The 1
st
 Defendant had admitted that free services were only provided for very minor and insignificant services. The Defendants have a shop at the Marina and operated a business. It would not be in the Defendants’ interest to provide free services without at least the expectation of future patronage. By providing free services, there would be indirect advantage to the Defendants in the form of future patronage and trade. In light of the foregoing, in my view, the bailment between the Plaintiff and the Defendants was a bailment for reward.
Whether the Defendants as bailees had proven on a balance of probabilities that they had taken reasonable care of the Vessel?
18     The next question I have to consider is whether the Defendants as bailees had breached their duty of care. Where goods on bailment were lost or destroyed, the burden was on the bailee to show, on a balance of probabilities that he had discharged his duty of care: 
Seah Ting Soon v Indonesian Tractors co Pte Ltd
 
[2001] 1 SLR(R) 53
 (“
Seah Ting Soon”)
 at [24]. As the Vessel sank at sea whilst in the Defendants’ exclusive possession and was subsequently declared a total loss, the onus is upon the Defendants to prove on a balance of probabilities that they had discharged their duty of care.
19     The bailment this case was a bailment for reward. In a bailment for reward, the duty of the bailee is to take reasonable care of the goods bailed: 
Chua Chye Leong
 at [44]. The duty of the Defendants as bailee was therefore to take reasonable care of the Vessel when the Vessel was in the Defendants’ possession. What constitutes reasonable care would depend on the facts, which in turn is determined by the standard of care expected of the bailee.
20     I begin the examination of the facts of the present case with the objective evidence of the Defendants’ website. The Plaintiff pointed out that the Defendants’ website states that:-
a.     The Defendants are a “
one-stop marine service
”;
b.     The Defendants provide “
24 hour emergency services
”;
c.     The Defendants provide “
underwater repair
” services;
d.     The Defendants have “
a seasoned team of specialists experienced in boat building and repair industry”;
e.     The Defendants have “
a long and enviable record of experience in boat building and maintenance/repair industry
”;
f.     The 1
st
 Defendant is a “
specialist in fiberglass manufacture and repair
” and had been “
operating local repair and maintenance business for past 6 years
”;
g.     The Defendants’ services include “
fiberglass works entail molding with composites and using various methods of construction operations to complete the works
.” The Defendants’ “
high skilled team, experienced in boat building and repair works are able to construct any requirement of fiberglass works
.”
21     The Defendants’ website shows that the Defendants have a level of expertise with fibreglass hull bodyworks and repairs. In court, it was established that the Defendants’ website was created in 2013 when the 1
st
 Defendant was the sole person in charge of the affairs of the Defendants. It would be hard put to accept that the 1
st
 Defendant would not be aware of the contents of the website. In any event, it does not appear that the 1
st
 Defendant is denying knowledge of the content of the website. The 1
st
 Defendant in his closing submissions raised a different complaint in regard to the evidence of the website. The 1
st
 Defendant said that the Plaintiff had tendered copies of the webpages belatedly at the trial. The 1
st
 Defendant’s complaint is that there is no evidence that the Plaintiff had seen these documents at the material time, or that he was influenced by the contents of the webpages at the material time leading to the sinking of the Vessel.
[note: 21]
 In my view however, this misses the point. The webpages were introduced by the Plaintiff to illustrate the level of expertise that the Defendants possessed and their knowledge of fibreglass hulls at the material time. This in turn goes towards determining, in law, the standard of care expected of the Defendants as bailee of the Vessel. It is not the state of mind of the Plaintiff that is in issue here.
22     In any case, in court, the 1
st
 Defendant agreed that he is somewhat “
knowledgeable on fibreglass hulls”
 and is a “
half-specialist”
 when it comes to fibreglass hulls.
[note: 22]
 He admitted that an underwater hull check of the Vessel using a freelance cleaner who was not a professional, who was unqualified to conduct checks, who did not use a light and who did not use an oxygen tank, was inadequate for the purposes of checking for suspected damage under the Vessel and that more thorough checks could have been carried out.
[note: 23]
 The 1
st
 Defendant was aware that there were professionals in the industry such as divers and surveyors whom he could have engaged to do a proper underwater hull check of the Vessel.
[note: 24]
23     It would therefore appear from the evidence that the Defendants possess a level of knowledge of fibreglass hulls and would know of the appropriate steps and checks to be taken when a vessel has suspected damage to the underwater hull. This is despite the 1
st
 Defendant stating in his AEIC that the Defendants were an inexperienced firm merely conducting simple services such as cleaning of boats.
[note: 25]
24     In his AEIC the 1
st
 Defendant also alluded to providing several options to the Plaintiff for the Vessel to be moved from the Marina to Punggol. He said that he discussed with the Plaintiff how he intended to move the Vessel from the Marina to Punggol. The options given to the Plaintiff included a choice to move the Vessel by land by engaging a crane to lift the Vessel on board a motor vehicle so that the Vessel could be transported by land.
[note: 26]
 However, during the cross-examination of the 1st Defendant, it was established that it was not physically possible to move a crane to the jetty at the Marina. In other words, there is no facility at the Marina to lift a boat onto a motor vehicle at the dockside. The 1
st
 Defendant admitted that the land transportation of the Vessel to Punggol was not possible. This was corroborated by the Plaintiff's witness, Captain Kang Ah Tee (“Captain Kang”), who gave evidence at the trial.
[note: 27]
 Captain Kang was a marine surveyor appointed by the Insurer to conduct a survey and investigation into the sinking of the Vessel.
25     Moreover, the 1
st
 Defendant apparently did not know what approvals and permits he had to seek to carry out the land transportation of the Vessel.
[note: 28]
 The 1
st
 Defendant agreed in court subsequently that at the time when he suggested the land transportation of the Vessel, he in fact knew that the sea voyage was the only way which the Vessel could be brought from the Marina to Punggol.
[note: 29]
26     With the Defendants’ state of knowledge and expertise, a certain standard of care would be expected of the Defendants in undertaking the sea voyage. This is especially so when the voyage involved a Vessel with suspected damage to the fibreglass hulls, which the 1
st
 Defendant was aware of.
27     The Plaintiff’s case
[note: 30]
 is that, based on such a standard of care, taking reasonable care of the Vessel whilst the Vessel was bailed by the Plaintiff to the Defendants would include properly inspecting the bottom of the Vessel to ascertain whether the bottom of the Vessel was damaged and that the Vessel was fit for the sea voyage before the commencement of the voyage from the Marina to Punggol. The Defendants should also have informed the Plaintiff that the checks were inadequate and further checks should be conducted before the Vessel was to go by sea. Further, the Plaintiff submits that proper inspections would include an underwater dive inspection conducted by a professional diving company with divers equipped with oxygen tanks, scuba diving equipment and underwater lights.
[note: 31]
 In the light of the evidence and the circumstances of the case, I agree that taking reasonable care of the Vessel would include the above steps to be taken by the Defendants.
28     The evidence shows however, that the steps that the Defendants took comprised conducting an underwater check on the Vessel on 14 November 2013 using a freelance underwater cleaner with snorkel and mask;
[note: 32]
 and checking the engine and internal compartments of the Vessel before the voyage from the Marina to Punggol.
[note: 33]
 As alluded to above, the burden is on a bailee to show, on a balance of probabilities that he had discharged his duty of care: 
Seah Ting Soon
 at [24]. In my view, on a balance of probabilities, the Defendants had failed to show that they had discharged their duty and taken reasonable care of the Vessel.
29     The 1
st
 Defendant has admitted at trial that it was inadequate for the Defendants to instruct a freelance cleaner to conduct an underwater check of the hull without any lights and without an oxygen mask. He had also admitted that a more thorough check would have been effected by a person who had proper qualifications and who was equipped with oxygen tanks, and lights.
[note: 34]
 The 1
st
 Defendant also admitted that he was aware of professionals in the industry who could carry out the proper inspections.
[note: 35]
 The use of such proper inspections were corroborated by Captain Kang, whose evidence is that a proper underwater dive inspection conducted by a professional diving company with divers equipped with oxygen tanks, scuba diving equipment and underwater lights prior to the voyage would have been able to ascertain whether hairline/minor cracks existed and whether the Vessel was fit for the voyage. Bearing in mind the knowledge of the Defendants in respect of fibreglass hulls discussed above, I find that the Defendants have been in breach of their duty as bailees.
Gratuitous bailment
30     I have made a finding that the bailment in this case is one for reward. However, it should be noted that it has been held that the difference between the two standards of care for a gratuitous bailment and a bailment for reward is almost indistinguishable: 
Chua Chye Leong
 at [44]. The line between the two standards is said to be very fine, difficult to discern and impossible to define: 
Port Swettenham Authority v T W Wu & Co (M) Sdn Bhd
 
[1979] AC 580
, at 589. It would appear therefore that even if the bailment between the Plaintiff and the Defendants was not a bailment for reward but a gratuitous bailment, the Defendants would nonetheless still be liable to the Plaintiff. In law, in a bailment for reward, the duty of the bailee is to take reasonable care of the goods bailed. In the case of a gratuitous bailment, the duty of the bailee is to take such care as a man of ordinary prudence would, under similar circumstances, take of his own goods.
[note: 36]
 The practical effect of the respective tests under the two types of bailment is therefore very similar. In my view, on the facts, the Defendants would still be in breach of their duty to take reasonable care of the Vessel under the standard of care expected of the Defendants in a gratuitous bailment.
31     Further, it has been held that the basic justification for casting duties upon a gratuitous bailee is that a person is not obliged to take possession of a chattel in relation to which another person has rights and that, if he chooses to do so, he assumes duties: 
Yearworth and others v North Bristol NHS Trust
 [2009] EWCA Civ 37 (“
Yearworth
”) at [48(b)]. It the present case, it would have been reasonable for the Defendants not to take possession of the Vessel and not to pilot the Vessel to Punggol when the Defendants knew that the Vessel could be damaged and that the checks done to the Vessel were inadequate. However, by taking possession of the Vessel and piloting her to Punggol, the Defendants assumed the duty to take reasonable care of the Vessel. In the light of the knowledge and expertise of the Defendants on the subject matter of fibreglass hulls, the facts show the Defendants had failed to exercise the duty to take reasonable care. I therefore find that the Defendants would be liable to the Plaintiff in bailment, even if it was gratuitous.
 
THE PLAINTIFF’S CLAIM IN NEGLIGENCE
 
Whether the Defendants owed a duty of care to the Plaintiff to take reasonable care of the Vessel
?
32     I turn next to the cause of action in negligence mounted by the Plaintiff. The test for the first element in the tort of negligence, the duty of care, is well settled. It consists of a threshold question of factual foreseeability, followed by a two-stage test comprising (a) proximity and (b) policy considerations: 
Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defence Science & Technology Agency
 
[2007] 4 SLR(R) 100
 (“
Spandeck
”) at [73].
33     The bar for the threshold test of factual foreseeability is not set high. All that is needed to be shown is that it is foreseeable that a defendant's negligence might result in persons such as the plaintiff suffering harm. This is a factual inquiry and a matter of common sense. In the present case, I find that it is plainly foreseeable that the Defendants’ negligence in failing to take reasonable care of the Vessel which was entrusted to the Defendants would result in the Plaintiff suffering a loss. The threshold test of factual foreseeability is satisfied.
34     In regard to the test of proximity, 
Spandeck
 at [77] held that there must be sufficient legal proximity between the plaintiff and the defendant in order for a duty of care to arise. The focus is on the closeness of the relationship between the parties, including physical, circumstantial and causal proximity, supported by the twin criteria of voluntary assumption of responsibility and reliance.
35     In the present case, the Vessel was in the possession of the Defendants at all material times. Physical proximity involves the notion of closeness in space and time. There was therefore physical proximity between the Defendants and the Plaintiff's property. In respect of circumstantial and causal proximity, it has been held in 
Spandex
 at [78] that this may refer to an overriding relationship between an employer and employee or between a professional man and his client. In the present case, the Plaintiff had engaged the Defendants' services by instructing the Defendants to check whether any repair was required from the grounding and by instructing the Defendants to pilot the Vessel from the Marina to Punggol. In my view, circumstantial and causal proximity exists between the Plaintiff and the Defendants.
36     There was therefore physical, circumstantial and causal proximity between the Plaintiff and the Defendants. There was a closeness of relationship between the Plaintiff and the Defendants established. As for the twin criteria of voluntary assumption of responsibility and reliance, the discussion above in respect of bailment would show that there was voluntary assumption of responsibility and reliance in the present case.
37     The next question is whether there are any policy considerations which would negate the duty between the Plaintiff and the Defendants. I do not see any policy concerns militating against the duty to take care that service providers such as the Defendants would owe to the recipients of their service. It follows from the foregoing that the Defendants owe a duty to the Plaintiff to take reasonable care of the Vessel.
What is the standard of care the Defendants are to be held to?
38     The next element in the tort of negligence is breach of duty. The relevant question in this regard is what is the standard of care the Defendants are to be held to in the present case? The standard of care is determined by a number of factors such as the likelihood and risks of harm as well as the extent of harm: Gary Chan Kok Yew, 
The Law of Torts in Singapore
 (Academy Publishing, 2011) at p187-190. Where the likelihood and risk of harm to the plaintiff or his property is high, a higher standard is expected of the defendant. Further, the more serious the damage, should an accident take place, the more precautions the defendant ought to have taken to prevent the damage. The Plaintiff refers me to two cases in regard to this point. In the case of 
Paris v Stepney Borough Council
 
[1951] 1 AC 367
, it was held that the defendant employer was held to a higher standard and should have reasonably taken into account the risk of greater injury to the plaintiff employee, who was already injured in the left eye, by providing goggles for his work. In the case of 
Philips v William Whiteley Ltd
 [1938] 1 All ER 566, the skills expected of a jeweller conducting an ear piercing operation was held to be that of a reasonable jeweller and not a surgeon. The standard of care in this regard is determined by measuring against industry practices and professional standards. The standard of care of a service provider would be taken to be that of a reasonable service provider. What is demanded of a defendant would therefore be based on his level of expertise, knowledge and skill.
39     The Plaintiff submits that it is clear in the present case that there was a high likelihood of risk and harm to the Plaintiff as the Defendants were aware that the Vessel had grounded and the Defendants were also aware that there was suspected damage at the bottom of the Vessel. The Defendants have expertise in the field of fibreglass hulls and had knowledge that there were professionals in the industry who could conduct proper underwater checks on the Vessel’s hull. I agree with the Plaintiff’s case that these would be indicia of a higher standard of care that the Defendants should be held to. The standard of care would be that of a vessel service provider who has knowledge of fibreglass hulls, knowledge of the suspected damage to the underwater hull of the Vessel, as well as knowledge of professionals in the industry who could conduct proper underwater checks on the Vessel's hull.
40     It follows from the facts discussed earlier in respect of bailment that the Defendants had also fallen short of the standard of care they were held to under the tort of negligence. I therefore find that the Defendants had breached their duty of care owed to the Plaintiff. As the breach resulted in damages suffered by the Plaintiff, I find on a balance of probabilities that the claim in negligence has been made out against the Defendants.
 
CAUSATION
 
41     The Defendants deny that the cause of the sinking was the Defendants’ breach of duty and failure to take reasonable care of the Vessel. Instead, the Defendant’s case is that the Vessel sank as a result of the bad weather and the Plaintiff’s own negligence and recklessness.
[note: 37]
 I will now discuss the issue of causation of the sinking of the Vessel.
42     The starting point of the analysis of this question is Captain Kang’s evidence. As alluded to above, Captain Kang was the marine surveyor engaged by the Insurer to conduct a survey and investigation into the sinking of the Vessel. His evidence is that the Vessel had hairline cracks prior to her departure from the Marina on 15 November 2013 and that the undiscovered hairline cracks to the Vessel were aggregated during the voyage due to the engine vibration as the port side propeller was unbalanced. Captain Kang further explained that based on his experience as a mariner and a marine surveyor, a proper underwater dive inspection conducted by a professional diving company with divers equipped with oxygen tanks, scuba diving equipment and underwater lights would have been able to ascertain whether such hairline cracks existed and whether the Vessel was fit for the voyage.
[note: 38]
 As discussed above, the evidence shows that the 1
st
 Defendant was aware of the suspected damage to the hull of the Vessel and that the initial checks by the freelance cleaner were inadequate. The 1
st
 Defendant was also aware that there were professionals in the industry such as divers and surveyors which he could have engaged to do a proper underwater hull check of the Vessel which was suspected to be damaged.
43     Turning to weather conditions, the Defendants did not adduce any objective evidence on the state of the weather at the time the Vessel sank. There is also no evidence to show that the crack in the Vessel which resulted in the water ingress was caused by bad weather conditions. The Defendants’ contention that the Vessel sank because of bad weather is not supported by any objective evidence. The Plaintiff has on the other hand, adduced evidence in the form of precipitation radar printouts and wind data records from the Meteorological Services Singapore (“MSS’). Mr Tham Chien Wan, who was Head of Climatology and Climate Studies at the MSS, testified and gave evidence to explain the weather data. It is clear from the data of MSS that, from the time the Vessel left the Marina on 15 November 2013 at 1145 hours to the time the Vessel sank at Outer Shoal Beacon at 1220 hours, there was no rain at the Marina and Outer Shoal Beacon.
[note: 39]
 The evidence adduced shows that during the time from 1145 hours to 1220 hours, the wind speeds were also mild at means of 5km/h to 6km/h. The maximum wind speed during the material time was 21.3km/h at 12:20 hours.
[note: 40]
 According to the Beaufort Scale produced in court by the Plaintiff, wind speeds of 6km/h are considered light breeze and wind speeds of 21.3km/h are considered moderate breeze. It is only when wind speeds are more than 29km/h (fresh breeze) that crested wavelets will form in the waters. In light of the above, contrary to the Defendants’ case that there were strong winds, heavy downpour and choppy seas, at the material time wind speed was only 21.3km/h. There was no inclement weather from the time the Vessel left the Marina at 1145 hours to the time she sank at Outer Shoal Beacon at 1220 hours.
44     In any event, even if there was inclement weather in the form of heavy downpour and strong winds, there is no evidence that this would have caused the crack in the Vessel or caused her to sink. Tham Chien Wan's evidence is that heavy to moderate showers with thunder and lightning as well as wind speeds of 25km/h are not uncommon in Singapore. Captain Kang also gave evidence that the cracks in the Vessel could not have been caused by heavy to moderate showers and winds gusting at 25km/h. He was of the view that weather conditions of heavy to moderate showers and wind gusting at 25km/h are common in Singapore and would not have caused cracks in any vessels. In my view, it is plain that the cause of the loss of the Vessel was not the inclement weather on 15 November 2013.
45     In respect of the Defendants’ case that the sinking of the Vessel was caused by the Plaintiff’s negligence and recklessness, the Defendants’ contention is that the Vessel sank because the Plaintiff failed to inform the 1st Defendant the truth and/or all the facts of what exactly happened to the Vessel on the night of 13 November 2013 whilst underway off Lazarus Island and further, failed to inform the Defendants that there was damage under the Vessel’s hull and that the Vessel might not be safe to sail.
[note: 41]
 In my view however, the evidence shows that there is nothing more the Plaintiff could have done or told the Defendants as the Defendants already knew of the suspected damage to the hull of the Vessel. When the Plaintiff instructed the 1st Defendant to check the Vessel for damages, the 1st Defendant had thought that the Vessel had grounded and that the Vessel was damaged.
[note: 42]
 There was no failure on the part of the Plaintiff to inform the Defendants of events on 13 November 2013 or of the damage under the Vessel's hull. In fact, the evidence shows that the Defendants were well aware of the suspected damage to the underwater hull of the Vessel.
46     The Defendants further contend that the Vessel sank because the Plaintiff failed to arrange for proper underwater inspections before authorizing the Defendants to move the Vessel to Punggol.
[note: 43]
 However, there is no dispute that the Plaintiff had instructed the 1
st
 Defendant to check the Vessel for damages. The Defendants knew that the bottom of the Vessel was damaged and should have conducted or arranged a proper underwater check of the Vessel. As discussed above, the Defendants were also aware of professionals in the industry who could have conducted a proper underwater inspection. There is no reason why the Plaintiff should be responsible for arranging proper underwater inspections before authorising the Defendants to move the Vessel to Punggol. Such arrangements should have been done by the Defendants.
47     In view of the foregoing, the Defendants have failed to show that the loss of the Vessel was caused by bad weather or the Plaintiff’s negligence and reckless acts. There is simply no evidence to support the Defendants’ contentions in this regard.
 
JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY OF THE DEFENDANTS
 
48     The Defendants contend in their closing submissions that the task of moving the Vessel was “a personal act” of the 1
st
 Defendant. The partnership should therefore not be liable to the Plaintiff.
[note: 44]
49     The Defendants were a partnership at the time of the loss of the Vessel with all three of the Defendants named as partners of the partnership.
[note: 45]
 The liability of partners is governed by the Partnership Act.
[note: 46]
 The relevant sections are as follows:
 
Power of partner to bind firm
 
 
5
.     
Every partner is an agent of the firm and his other partners for the purpose of the business of the partnership; and the acts of every partner who does any act for carrying on in the usual way business of the kind carried on by the firm of which he is a member bind the firm and his partners, unless the partner so acting has in fact no authority to act for the firm in the particular matter, and the person with whom he is dealing either knows that he has no authority, or does not know or believe him to be a partner.
 
 
Liability of partners
 
 
9
.     
Every partner in a firm is liable jointly with the other partners for all debts and obligations of the firm incurred while he is a partner; and after his death his estate is also severally liable in a due course of administration for such debts and obligations, so far as they remain unsatisfied, but subject to the prior payment of his separate debts.
 
 
Liability of firm for wrongs
 
 
10
.     
Where, by any wrongful act or omission of any partner acting in the ordinary course of the business of the firm, or with the authority of his co-partners, loss or injury is caused to any person not being a partner in the firm, or any penalty is incurred, the firm is liable therefor to the same extent as the partner so acting or omitting to act.
 
 
Liability for wrongs joint and several
 
 
12
.     
Every partner is liable jointly with his co-partners and also severally for everything for which the firm while he is a partner therein becomes liable under sections 10 or 11.
 
50     The Defendants have been providing services to the Plaintiff at the Marina as a firm. The Defendants’ business concerns the repair, service and maintenance of pleasure crafts. Although the 1
st 
Defendant was the sole person in charge of the affairs of the Defendants, the 1
st 
Defendant’s acts bound the Defendants (as a partnership) as well as the 2
nd 
and 3
rd 
Defendants. The law in relation to partnership is trite in this regard and can be seen in sections 5, 9, 10 and 12 of the Partnership Act. The acts of checking the Vessel for damages and bringing the Vessel to Punggol fell under the usual business of the Defendants. Pursuant to section 5 of the Partnership Act, as all of the 1
st 
Defendant’s acts in relation to the Plaintiff and the Vessel were carried out in the usual way of the Defendants’ business, the acts bound the partnership and the 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 Defendants.
51     By reason of section 10 of the Partnership Act, the Defendants as a partnership are liable to the same extent as the 1
st 
Defendant for the 1
st 
Defendant's breach of duties in tort and bailment. Under section 12 of the Partnership Act, the 2
nd 
and 3
rd 
Defendants are jointly and severally liable to the Plaintiff for the 1
st 
Defendant's breach of duties in bailment and negligence. I accordingly find all three Defendants jointly and severally liable to the Plaintiff for the damage caused.
 
CONCLUSION
 
52     In summary I find as follows:-
a.     A bailment arose between the Plaintiff and the Defendants when the Defendants took possession of the Vessel for the sea voyage from the Marina to Punggol. The bailment was a bailment for reward.
b.     The Defendants owed a duty of care to the Plaintiff under the tort of negligence to take reasonable care of the Vessel.
c.     The Defendants have failed to show on a balance of probabilities that they had taken reasonable care of the Vessel. The Defendants failed to meet the standard of care and breached the duties owed to the Plaintiff in bailment and under the tort of negligence. The Defendants would have been equally liable even if the bailment was gratuitous.
d.     The sinking of the Vessel was caused by the Defendants’ breach of duty. There is no evidence of any inclement weather or that any inclement weather caused the loss of the Vessel. There is no evidence that the loss of the Vessel was caused by the Plaintiff’s contributory negligence or reckless acts.
53     As stated above, the issue of quantum is not in dispute. The agreed quantum is in the sum of $155,000.00. There shall therefore be judgment against the 1
st
, 2
nd 
and 3
rd 
Defendants, jointly and severally, for the sum of $155,000.00; with interest at 5.33% p.a. from the date of writ to judgment, and costs to the Plaintiff to be taxed, if not agreed.

 Steven Chong JA (delivering the judgment of the court 
ex tempore
):
1       In 
Liew Zheng Yang v Public Prosecutor
 
[2017] SGHC 157
 (“the Judgment”), I allowed the appeal by the appellant, Liew Zheng Yang (“Liew”), against his conviction of two charges of abetting in a conspiracy to traffic controlled drugs under s 5(2) and s 12 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the MDA”), read with s 107(
b
) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (collectively, “the Conspiracy Charges”). I set aside his conviction for the Conspiracy Charges, and convicted him on two reduced charges of attempted possession of the same drugs under ss 8(
a
) and 12 of the MDA (“the Attempted Possession Charges”). The drugs in question were 34.53 grams of cannabis and 68.21 grams of cannabis mixture, for the first and second charges respectively.
2       The present matter concerns the sentences to be imposed in respect of the Attempted Possession Charges. In the course of this judgment, I will also address a new sentencing framework proposed by the Prosecution for the offence of drug possession.
3       Liew had also pleaded guilty to one charge of consumption of a cannabinol derivative under s 8(
b
)(ii) of the MDA (“the Consumption Charge”). The district judge sentenced Liew to six months’ imprisonment for the Consumption Charge, and Liew did not appeal against this sentence. Subsequently, after the Judgment was delivered, Liew brought Criminal Motion No 32 of 2017 (“CM 32/2017”) to seek an extension of time to file a notice of appeal against the sentence imposed for the Consumption Charge. I heard and dismissed CM 32/2017 on 19 September 2017, and stayed the execution of the sentence pending the determination of the sentences for the Attempted Possession Charges. Given that Liew has been convicted of three charges, the sentences for at least two of these charges must run consecutively: s 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed).
Parties’ submissions 
4       Parties are in agreement that the sentences for the Attempted Possession Charges should run consecutively with the sentence for the Consumption Charge. They differ, however, on the appropriate sentence for the Attempted Possession Charges.
5       Liew’s counsel, Mr Eugene Thuraisingam (“Mr Thuraisingam”), submits that a sentence of no more than 12 months’ imprisonment should be imposed for each of the Attempted Possession Charges. This will result in a global sentence of no more than 18 months’ imprisonment.
[note: 1]
6       The Prosecution, on the other hand, proposes the following indicative starting points for sentencing first-time offenders of drug possession involving cannabis and cannabis mixture (“the Indicative Table”):
[note: 2]
 
Cannabis
 
 
Cannabis Mixture
 
 
Imprisonment
 
 
Up to 15g
 
 
Up to 30g
 
 
6–18 months
 
 
15–165g 
 
 
30­–330g
 
 
18 months­–3 years
 
 
165–330g
 
 
330–660g
 
 
3–5 years
 
 
330–500g
 
 
660–1000g
 
 
5–7 years
 
 
More than 500g
 
 
More than 1000g
 
 
7–10 years
 
7       The indicative starting points in the Indicative Table are based on the quantity of drugs involved. The Prosecution submits that the Indicative Table is in line with the sentencing approach for drug trafficking offences, which also begins with indicative starting points based on the quantity of drugs involved, before adjusting the sentence based on the offender’s culpability and the presence of relevant aggravating or mitigating factors: 
Vasentha d/o Joseph v Public Prosecutor
 
[2015] 5 SLR 122
 (“
Vasentha
”) at [44].
[note: 3]
 The Prosecution also relies on 
Public Prosecutor v Jumahat Bin Japar
 
[2016] SGDC 278
 (“
Jumahat
”) as a precedent where the district judge had agreed with similar indicative starting points in relation to the possession of diamorphine and methamphetamine.
[note: 4]
8       On the basis of the Indicative Table, the Prosecution submits that Liew should be sentenced to a term of at least 24 months’ imprisonment for each of the Attempted Possession Charges and a global sentence of at least 30 months’ imprisonment.
[note: 5]
My Decision
The Indicative Table
9       In my view, it is not appropriate to adopt the indicative starting points proposed by the Prosecution. The Court of Appeal observed in 
Ng Kean Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor
 
[2017] 2 SLR 449
 at [30] that such an approach (which was referred to as the “multiple starting points” approach) “is suitable where the offence in question is clearly targeted at a 
particular
 mischief which is measurable according to a single (usually quantitative) metric that assumes primacy in the sentencing analysis” [emphasis in original]. The offence of drug 
trafficking
 was cited by the Court of Appeal as a “paradigmatic” example of such offences.
10     However, this does not mean that 
all
 drug-related offences are compatible with a multiple starting points approach. In 
Public Prosecutor v Tan Thian Earn
 
[2016] 3 SLR 269
, See Kee Oon JC (as he then was) expressly declined to adopt a “multiple starting points” approach for offences under s 10A(1) of the MDA. Section 10A(1) of the MDA proscribes the manufacture, supply, possession, import or export of any controlled equipment, materials, or substances which are useful for the manufacture of a controlled drug.
11     See JC explained (at [35]–[36]) that a “multiple starting points” approach was unsuitable for s 10A(1) offences because such offences may be committed “in a variety of circumstances and for a variety of reasons” such that “no sensible sentencing tariffs can be promulgated” for the offence if the culpability of the individual offender is not taken into account. See JC distinguished s 10A(1) offences from the offence of drug trafficking, as follows (at [36]):
… [The s 10A(1) offence] differs somewhat from the offence of trafficking, where the range of scenarios is more restricted and therefore the use of the quantity of drugs involved (which is the primary determinant of harm) suffices to provide a useful starting point. …
12     Similarly, the “multiple starting points” approach is unsuitable for the offence of drug possession. It cannot be denied that offenders who commit the offence might do so for a variety of reasons: (a) for trafficking; (b) for own consumption; and (c) for a purpose which is not clear on the evidence.
13     In fact, the very case which the Prosecution cited as supporting the Indicative Table, 
Jumahat
 (see above at [7]), stated at [20] that “if the accused had possessed the drugs for his own consumption, the figures in the [table of proposed indicative starting points] would not apply with as much persuasive force …”.
14     This must be correct because an offender who possesses drugs to traffic should be punished more severely than an offender who possesses drugs for his own consumption since in the former case, harm is caused to others while in the latter case, harm is caused to oneself.
15     Here, because of the manner in which the Prosecution conducted its case in the court below, in particular Liew’s unchallenged testimony that the drugs were for his own consumption, I found that the drugs were for Liew’s own consumption (the Judgment at [19]–[28]).
16     Therefore I would approach the sentencing of this case in the usual way by examining the aggravating and mitigating factors which are germane to the charge of possession for the purpose of his own consumption, keeping in mind the 
existing
 sentencing precedents.
The appropriate term of imprisonment 
17     In the context of the offence of drug consumption, the High Court in 
Dinesh Singh Bhatia s/o Amarjeet Singh v Public Prosecutor
 
[2005] 3 SLR(R) 1
 at [38] (“
Dinesh Singh
”) established a sentencing range of between six to 18 months’ imprisonment for first-time offenders. The court (at [38]–[39]) also identified the following non-exhaustive factors as relevant in calibrating the precise sentence for each offender:
(a)     the age of the offender;
(b)     the quantity of drugs involved;
(c)     the circumstances that led to the consumption of drugs (
eg
, whether the consumption of drugs was planned, and whether payment was made for the drugs); and
(d)     whether the offender was a first-time drug consumer, a casual consumer or an addict.
18     The sentencing range and a number of the factors identified in 
Dinesh Singh
 were applied recently by Sundaresh Menon CJ in the context of drug possession in 
Public Prosecutor v Lim Cheng Ji Alvin
 
[2017] SGHC 183
 at [28]–[29] (“
Alvin Lim
”). In 
Alvin Lim
, the offender was charged for the possession of 0.91 grams of cannabis mixture, which were meant for his own consumption. The offender was originally sentenced by the district judge to probation. Upon the prosecution’s appeal to the High Court, Menon CJ set aside the probation order, and sentenced the offender to eight months’ imprisonment. In determining the appropriate sentence, Menon CJ took into account the offender’s relatively young age of 26 years old at the time of the offence and the fact that the offender was not a one-off user of drugs.
19     Applying the factors identified in 
Dinesh Singh
 to the present case, it was clear, as Mr Thuraisingam accepted, that the following factors were aggravating. First, a large quantity of drugs were involved. This is a point that I will return to later (below at [21]–[22]). Second, Liew was not a casual or a one-off user of drugs.
20     On the other hand, Liew was a young offender, aged 22, at the time of the offence. In addition, he has demonstrated his commitment to take responsibility to rid himself of the drug addiction problem. He sought treatment with a psychiatrist,
[note: 6]
 has been drug-free in the three years since the offences and is presently gainfully employed.
21     With these factors in mind, I turn to calibrate the precise length of imprisonment. In my view, it would not be sufficient to compare the present case with 
Dinesh Singh
 and 
Alvin Lim
 due to the large quantity of drugs involved in this case. It will be recalled that Liew had attempted to possess 34.53 grams of cannabis and 68.21 grams of cannabis mixture. This was far in excess of the amount of drugs (0.91 grams of cannabis mixture) involved in 
Alvin Lim
.
22      
Dinesh Singh
 was also somewhat less relevant because the quantity of drugs in Liew’s possession were far more than what a person could have consumed in one session. In fact, Liew’s own evidence at trial was that he had bought the drugs “in a huge amount” in order to “
stock up
 and keep it at home for… [his] own consumption” [emphasis added] (the Judgment at [19]). Bearing in mind that 
Dinesh Singh
 was a case on drug 
consumption
, the quantity of drugs in this case was arguably beyond the amounts contemplated by the High Court when the sentencing range of six to 18 months’ imprisonment was laid down. Therefore, it was more relevant to consider precedents where the quantity of drugs involved were similar to the present case.
23     In 
Public Prosecutor v Ang Wei Hsiung Kenneth
 
[2017] SGDC 70
 (“
Kenneth Ang (DC)
”), the offender (“Kenneth”) pleaded guilty to two possession charges and one consumption charge. The possessions charges related to 26.95 grams of cannabis and 72 tablets containing Nimetazepam, a Class C drug, respectively. Kenneth had intended to consume these drugs (at [3]). The offender was sentenced to 24 months’ imprisonment for the cannabis possession charge and five months’ imprisonment for Class C possession charge. These two sentences were ordered to run consecutively, resulting in a global sentence of 29 months’ imprisonment. Kenneth appealed against the sentences imposed, and the appeal was heard and dismissed by me in 
Ang Wei Hsiung Kenneth v Public Prosecutor
 Magistrate’s Appeal No 9064 of 2017 (30 June 2017) (
“Kenneth Ang (HC)
”).
24     The present case bore some similarities with 
Kenneth Ang (HC)
. Both Liew and Kenneth were drug addicts who had purchased comparable quantities of drugs for their own consumption. While the quantity of drugs that Liew had attempted to possess was somewhat larger than the quantity of drugs that Kenneth possessed, Liew was also considerably younger than the 38-year-old Kenneth. Kenneth also appeared to have a more serious drug problem than Liew as he consumed a wide variety of drugs (
Kenneth Ang (DC)
 at [1]–[2(i)]), whereas Liew’s involvement in drugs was confined to cannabis and its variants. On the whole, it was appropriate to impose a sentence on Liew that was shorter than the sentence imposed on Kenneth.
25     Taking into account the two accepted aggravating factors, that Liew was not a one-off drug user and that the quantity of the drugs involved was large, together with his relative young age and his commitment to take responsibility to rid himself of his drug addiction following his conviction, as well as the relevant sentencing benchmark, the most recent of which is 
Kenneth Ang (HC)
, I sentence Liew to 20 months’ imprisonment for each of the Attempted Possession Charges which is to run consecutively with the earlier 6-month sentence for the Consumption Charge for a global sentence of 26 months’ imprisonment. The sentence is to commence today.

6524999,R v Walker (No 8) [2017] NSWSC 1548,"EX TEMPORE Judgment


	
	This matter was listed for sentencing on 16 November 2017, Mr Walker having been convicted in August 2017 by a jury, of the murder of his partner, Linda Locke, in April 2015.
	
	
	After the matter was listed for sentence, the Court was notified that Mr Walker had been hospitalised. He did not appear for sentence in circumstances explained in an affidavit sworn by his solicitor, Ms Pearce, to which was annexed a letter from a treating doctor at Prince of Wales Hospital. The letter advised that Mr Walker had recently been diagnosed to be suffering from cancer; that his condition had deteriorated; and that his prognosis was very poor, there being no suitable treatment available for his condition. His lifespan was then thought to be short. Neither at the trial nor sentence hearing, had there been evidence that he was suffering such ill health.
	
	
	By consent of the Crown, on 16 November, the matter was adjourned and I directed the parties to file written submissions, there being an issue between them as to whether sentencing could proceed in Mr Walker’s absence, without his consent. The Crown then accepted that Mr Walker should have the opportunity to instruct his counsel as to whether he wished to waive his right to be present when he was sentenced, before that issue was resolved.
	
	
	Before today’s further listing, when that issue was due to be dealt with, the Court was notified that Mr Walker had died. That has removed the need to resolve the question of whether, in Mr Walker’s circumstances before his death, the Court could proceed to sentence him, even in his absence, given either his refusal, or inability to waive his right to be present, which the parties had addressed in their written submissions.
	
	
	The Crown then filed a further written submission, in which it accepted that under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), the Court could not now “sentence” Mr Walker, that being defined in s 3 to mean “the penalty imposed for an offence” and “sentencing court” there being defined to mean “in relation to an offender undergoing a penalty imposed by a court, means the court by which the penalty was imposed”. The word “penalty” is not defined in the Act and so takes its ordinary meaning. It is relevantly defined in the Macquarie Dictionary to mean “a punishment imposed or incurred for a violation of a law”.
	
	
	In oral submissions the Crown also made reference to the purpose of sentencing specified in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which provides:
	


“The purposes for which a court may impose a sentence upon an offender are as follows:

(a)    To ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence,

(b)    To prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing other similar offences,

( c)    To protect the community from the offender,

(d)    To promote the rehabilitation of the offender,

(e)    To make the offender accountable for his or her actions,

(f)    To denounce the conduct of the offender, and,

(g)    To recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.""


	
	The Crown thus submitted that, once an unsentenced offender has died, the Court cannot impose any punishment upon him or her and, accordingly, the offender cannot be sentenced for the offences of which he or she has been convicted, nor can the sentencing remarks which would have been delivered if the offender still lived, be published.
	
	
	It is s 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which specifies the penalty which may be imposed on an offender. Section 5 deals with penalties of imprisonment, providing:
	


“5    Penalties of imprisonment

(1)    A court must not sentence an offender to imprisonment unless it is satisfied, having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate.

(2)    A court that sentences an offender to imprisonment for 6 months or less must indicate to the offender, and make a record of, its reasons for doing so, including:

(a)    its reasons for deciding that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate, and

(b)    its reasons for deciding not to make an order allowing the offender to participate in an intervention program or other program for treatment or rehabilitation (if the offender has not previously participated in such a program in respect of the offence for which the court is sentencing the offender).

(3)    Subsection (2) does not limit any other requirement that a court has, apart from that subsection, to record the reasons for its decisions.

(4)    A sentence of imprisonment is not invalidated by a failure to comply with this section.

(5)    Subject to sections 12 and 99, Part 4 applies to all sentences of imprisonment, including any sentence the subject of an intensive correction order or home detention order.”


	
	I accept as the Crown submitted, that s 5 must be understood as contemplating that to sentence a person to a term of imprisonment, he or she must be alive to serve the intended sentence to be imposed by the Court, notwithstanding the provision made in s 5(4) and the other purposes of sentencing specified in s 3A.
	
	
	Mr Walker had been in custody, bail refused, since his arrest in April 2015. On the evidence, before his death, he received the treatment he required for his condition in hospital, after his conviction of Ms Locke’s murder. That accorded with the principle that offenders may not escape punishment because of the condition of their health and that it is the responsibility of correctional services authorities to provide appropriate care and treatment for sick prisoners: R v Achurch (2011) 216 A Crim R 152; [2011] NSWCCA 186 at [135].
	
	
	It is the State Parole Authority which may direct the release of an offender on parole, before the offender's eligibility date, if an offender is dying, or if the Authority is satisfied that it is necessary to release the offender on parole, because of exceptional circumstances: Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 (NSW), s 160(1). The Crown’s prerogative of mercy is also preserved by s 270 of that Act. None of these discretions were exercised in Mr Walker’s case and so he died in custody.
	
	
	It was also the Crown's case that, despite Mr Walker's death, on this occasion it was open to the Court to make some observations about his offending, even though the sentencing remarks which would have been delivered, had he lived, cannot be published. I agree. Accordingly, I make the following observations:
	



	
	The blow under Ms Locke's chin and Mr Walker pulling her backwards to the ground were both Mr Walker's deliberate acts. Each were capable, individually or together, of resulting in the tearing of her bridging veins which led to the haemorrhage and haematoma which caused Ms Locke’s death.
	
	
	Both acts involved considerable, deliberate violence.
	
	
	Ms Locke was particularly vulnerable to Mr Walker's violence, not only because she was affected by both drugs and alcohol that night, but because of the nature of their long standing relationship and where and when that violence occurred, late at night in the home which they shared together.
	
	
	At committal Mrs Hartl's translated evidence was of having seen Mr Walker push Ms Locke back to the position in which she lay motionless. That cannot detract from these conclusions. Mrs Hartl did not accept that description at trial, when what she and Mr Hartl both described involved considerably more aggression on Mr Walker's part, than that, consistent with what other neighbours had heard him say and do over the course of that night.
	
	
	The force which Mr Walker then used was sufficient to have rendered Ms Locke unconscious, even if his earlier blows did not.
	
	
	Ms Locke may have regained consciousness at some time during the night, when Mr Hartl heard some further yelling. That cannot have been for long, given the next morning Ms Locke was seen lying in the same position to that which she had fallen between 1:15 and 1:30am.
	
	
	While it must be accepted that Mr Walker had not planned or intended to cause Ms Locke a fatal brain injury, the evidence established beyond reasonable doubt his intention to cause her grievous bodily harm, as the jury found.
	
	
	That Mr Walker just acted on an impulsive loss of control when he pulled Ms Locke back, after he had quietly asked Ms Locke to stop slamming the door and come inside, also cannot be accepted, given the evidence of all that the neighbours heard and saw that night; how the sustained arguing was pursued over the course of the night; what occurred after midnight, before Mr Walker's final violent act, when he pulled Ms Locke forcibly backwards into the position in which she stayed until morning; and the considerable force which Mr Walker then used, which brought Ms Locke's cries for assistance to an abrupt end.
	
	
	Mr Walker then slamming the door, leaving Ms Locke bleeding heavily from the head, unconscious and in obvious need of medical assistance; and later cleaning up blood from the carpet, were also deliberate acts.
	
	
	That it was merely lack of understanding, panic or a desire not to be blamed for Ms Locke's serious injuries which motivated Mr Walker to leave her lying helplessly on the ground, as she was found by ambulance officers, cannot be accepted. The further yelling which Mr Hartl heard later that night, he having also seen Mr Walker at the window; and Mr Walker having cleaned up, as he said he did, before the ambulance arrived, precluded those conclusions.
	
	
	The evidence established that it was Mr Walker's deliberate and callous failure to seek timely assistance which Ms Locke so obviously needed, which brought about her death. That Mr Walker's behaviour was not deliberate or calculated to conceal his crime, or consistent with his nervousness or shock when he later realised the seriousness of the situation, also could not be accepted. What he variously told the 000 operator, ambulance and police precluded those conclusions.
	
	
	What Mr Walker did, having seriously injured Ms Locke as he undoubtedly appreciated, not only long delaying before calling for assistance, but giving inconsistent and plainly false accounts as to what had happened; not going to the hospital or even enquiring after Ms Locke, but remaining at home to continue cleaning; and finally, refusing to open the door when the police attended - were not consistent with Mr Walker not only having had a real appreciation of the seriousness of his actions, but also actively pursuing steps to avoid responsibility for them.
	
	
	One neighbour saw the lights on at 5:10 am when she got up and still Mr Walker did not seek assistance for Ms Locke. Even accepting that he had slept for a time as Mr Walker claimed in the 000 call, he did not even then call for help, as he so easily could have.
	
	
	That Mr Walker's offence was objectively very serious, inflicting death being the most serious offence of domestic violence which an offender can commit, thus cannot be doubted.
	



	
	Had Mr Walker’s sentencing proceeded, given the seriousness of Mr Walker’s offence; his moral culpability for that offending; how the factual issues lying between the parties had to be resolved; the applicable statutory guideposts provided by the maximum sentence imposed by the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) for the offence of murder, namely, life imprisonment and the standard 20 year non-parole period fixed for such offences; the applicable sentencing principles; the evidence on which Mr Walker was to be sentenced, including as to the factual matters over which the parties had joined issue and his personal circumstances – a very considerable sentence would have been imposed upon Mr Walker.
	
	
	While Mr Walker’s death has precluded a sentence being imposed upon him, it has also established that even if he had been sentenced on 16 November 2017, he would not have lived to serve much more of the sentence, which he had effectively been serving since his arrest in 2015.
	
	
	Accordingly, all that now remains for the Court to do is to deal with the victim impact statements which were received at the sentencing hearing and which I considered before sentence, in accordance with s 28 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure Act).
	
	
	At the sentence hearing four very moving victim impact statements were read out in open court, one made by Ms Locke’s mother, another by her father, one by her sister and another by her daughter, who had been called to give what was obviously very painful evidence at trial, about domestic violence she had observed Mr Walker inflict on her mother, in the past. That the consequences of all of these difficult experiences have been particularly hard for her, was very obvious from her evidence and her statement.
	
	
	Even though because of Mr Walker’s death, he cannot now be sentenced, I am satisfied that it should still be said in open court, that it has long been recognised by the law, that all human life is precious and that the death of any person is a harm which an offender inflicts, not only on the victim and the victim’s family, but also on the community generally. Further, domestic violence related crime is particularly abhorred: Munda v Western Australia (2013) 249 CLR 600; [2013] HCA 38 at [55].
	
	
	From the evidence received at trial, it was obvious that the tragic reality is that Ms Locke’s death was not only unnecessary, but also truly awful, resulting as it did from the acts of her partner, against whom she was finally defenceless and from whom she did not then receive the help he should have given her, when she so desperately needed it and when it could have been so easily given.
	
	
	One human life cannot be valued over that of another. Nevertheless, in this case the victim impact statements which were read to the Court shed considerable light on the harm which Ms Locke’s murder had done to her family, especially her daughter. No one who heard those statements read that day, could have failed to be moved by them.
	
	
	To Ms Locke’s family and friends I thus offer my very deepest sympathy for their awful loss, as well as what they have had to endure during these proceedings and what, particularly for them, will be an unwelcome conclusion to that process.
	
	
	What her family, in particular, must continue to bear, not only as the result of her death, but also as the result of the dreadful way that it was brought about, is no doubt very difficult for others to comprehend. Their very difficult situation is, however, acknowledged. Their suffering is not overlooked by the community of which we are all members, but rather is recognised today.
	
	
	It is to be hoped that the proceedings will still give them all some small measure of comfort, revealing as they do how our society and the legal system it has created, operates to deal with awful offending of the kind which Ms Locke’s murder involved, even though the final step intended by this process, the imposition of a sentence on Mr Walker, could not be taken by the Court because of his unexpected death.
