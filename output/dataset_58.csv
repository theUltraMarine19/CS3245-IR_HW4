2706615,"PETTERSON, Benjamin v R [2013] NSWCCA 133","Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ AT CL: I agree with Hall J.

2HALL J: The applicant, Benjamin James Petterson, seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed on him by the District Court on 7 August 2009. In the application he relies upon a single ground of appeal in the following terms:

""The Applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance due to the disparity of the sentence imposed upon the Applicant and those imposed upon the co-offenders Mark Garcia and Philip Lindsay Matthews.""

3The Crown observed that, given that the application for leave to appeal had been lodged on 18 December 2012 (over three years after the applicant was sentenced), an extension of time for the application for leave to appeal was required. In support, the applicant relies upon his own affidavit sworn 17 December 2012.

4In the circumstances of the case the Crown did not oppose the extension of time sought. Accordingly, the applicant should be granted an extension of time for the purposes of bringing the present application for leave to appeal.

The Offences

5The applicant was sentenced in the District Court with respect to four offences as follows:

1. Escape from lawful custody.

2. An offence of break enter and steal pursuant to s 112(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 together with, on a Form 1, an offence of take and drive conveyance and possess prohibited drug.

3. An offence of knowingly taking part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug on 26 July 2008 pursuant to s 24(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985.

4. An offence of attempt to possess a precursor to use in the manufacture of a prohibited drug pursuant to s 24A(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985.

7I turn to the ground of appeal.

Ground of Appeal - The Applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance due to the disparity of the sentence imposed upon the Applicant and those imposed upon the co-offenders, Mark Garcia (""Garcia"") and Philip Lindsay Matthews (""Matthews"")

Preliminary Observations

8Before considering the parity ground, it is noted that Garcia and Matthews did not face the same charges in respect of which the applicant was sentenced. They were prosecuted separately by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions in relation to a charge of importing a commercial quantity of the border controlled precursor, pseudoephedrine, concealed in a water pump which was subsequently delivered to the applicant intending that he or another person use it to manufacture a controlled drug.

9Both of the co-offenders were sentenced some years after the applicant's sentence hearing.

Co-Offender Matthews

10Matthews was charged with a single offence, being an offence under s 307.11(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth). An offence under that provision carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. The importation charge was the only charge faced by Matthews. After Matthews was found guilty at trial he was sentenced in the District Court, by Tupman DCJ, on 23 January 2012 to a total term of imprisonment of 7 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months. 

11Matthews was the principal and organiser in the importation of the pseudoephedrine secreted in a water pump. He was not charged in relation to any manufacturing process (as was the applicant). Accordingly he was dealt with solely on the basis that he had imported a commercial quantity of precursor with the intention that he or another would use it in the manufacturing process with which the applicant was concerned. The pseudoephedrine imported was in fact never used in any manufacturing process because it had been intercepted by the Australian Customs Service and substituted with an inert substance.

12In the applicant's case he was, as noted above, charged with the abovementioned manufacturing offence under s 24(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act (see [6] above) as well as an offence of attempt to possess the precursor to be used in manufacture contrary to s 24A(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act.

13In her remarks on sentence the sentencing judge noted that Matthews and Garcia travelled to Thailand from Sydney and returned on 14 June 2008. It was there that Matthews decided to acquire the tablets containing pseudoephedrine and then import them into Australia so that they could be used to manufacture methylamphetamine.

14The sentencing judge did not accept the submission that Matthews' role was equal to that of Garcia. Although Garcia stood to gain financially from his involvement in the offence and took out a loan of $25,000 for initial funding of the venture, the sentencing judge determined that the evidence established that these matters were done by Garcia under Matthews' supervision. Matthews was found to have been the organiser for financial gain of the importation. There was a significant level of planning and organisation involved in the offence.

Co-Offender Garcia

15Garcia pleaded guilty to the lesser offence of aiding and abetting Matthews in the importation of a commercial quantity of precursor (pseudoephedrine) secreted in the water pump.

16Garcia also pleaded guilty to the State offence of knowingly taking part in the manufacture of methylamphetamine at a property in Ariah Park. This was the location of the site where the applicant was initially apprehended by police from whose custody he soon after escaped.

17Garcia was not present at the property when police arrived. Garcia's involvement appears to have been established by a number of items found and which were linked to him. These included personal identification documentation. In addition, Garcia's fingerprint was also found on an item at the laboratory at the site. His role is discussed at [47](4)-(8) below.

18Garcia was sentenced on 10 February 2011 in the District Court, by Tupman DCJ, to a total term of 4 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months in relation to the importation offence.

19An entirely concurrent sentence of 3 years and 2 months with a non-parole period of 2 years was imposed in relation to the offence of knowingly taking part in the manufacturer of methylamphetamine.

THE APPLICANT

20The charge against the applicant under s 24(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act related to activities associated with the manufacture of a prohibited drug at Ariah Park on 26 July 2008, the day of his arrest. 

21The charge of attempting to possess a precursor for the use in the manufacture of a prohibited drug was committed by the applicant on 29 July 2008.

22The applicant's offence of knowingly taking part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug carried a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment. In respect of the offence of attempting to possess a precursor for use in the manufacture of a prohibited drug, the offence carried a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment.

23Following his arrest on 26 July 2008, the applicant managed to escape. He was charged with an offence of escape police custody in relation to this conduct. After escaping, the applicant then proceeded to break into a nearby farm. He stole the key to a utility vehicle and drove away after using an angle-grinder to cut through the links that joined his handcuffs. This conduct formed the offence of break, enter and steal with a charge of take and drive conveyance on a Form 1.

24At the manufacture site at Ariah Park, police found a glass reaction flask which contained a quantity of yellow translucent liquid of 450 millilitres. Amongst the various items discovered were chemicals necessary for the manufacture of methylamphetamine and 52 grams of a substance later field tested as being a prohibited drug, pseudoephedrine, a substance that is essential to the manufacture of methylamphetamine. 

25Investigators believed, on the basis of observations made and having regard to the items located, that the initial stages of the manufacture of methylamphetamine had been undertaken.

26At the time of the relevant offence, the applicant was on parole in relation to an offence of armed robbery. As discussed below, this was a serious aggravating factor.

27In relation to the offence of attempt to possess a precursor for use in the manufacture of a prohibited drug, as noted above at [11] the Australian Customs Service had seized a quantity of powder weighing 12.64 kilograms which was found to be partially pseudoephedrine. It was hidden in what was a high-pressure water pump. Officials inspected it and substituted an inert substance for the powder.

28The pump was ultimately delivered in a wooden crate to premises near Temora. The applicant was on hand to take possession of the crate and ultimately was involved with another man in dismantling the crate and removing the water pump. 

29He managed to dismantle the water pump to retrieve what he believed to be powder containing pseudoephedrine.

30The Agreed Statement of Facts establishes various actions and statements by the applicant consistent with knowledge of what was contained within the water pump, or what he believed to be contained within the water pump.

31The applicant was arrested on 29 July 2008 following the execution of a search warrant. The applicant once again attempted to escape by diving through a window but was restrained and immediately arrested.

32Authorities observed a bucket containing a quantity of white powder on the premises. The powder was the inert substance that had been substituted by the Australian Customs Service when it had discovered the pseudoephedrine.

33In the Remarks on Sentence in relation to the applicant, on 7 August 2009, Norrish DCJ noted:

""In relation to the objective facts, arising from the agreed statement of facts, it is clear in relation to the manufacturing process that it was set up in a sophisticated fashion to commence the process of manufacture of methylamphetamine. There is no evidence available to me that the prisoner set it up of his volition. The prisoner was, it was conceded by the Crown, to be regarded as a hireling or a hired help in the process of manufacture and related matters. But he was clearly an important person, notwithstanding the fact that he was not an organiser.

His presence at the place of manufacture no doubt was important for the security of the process and its continual operation."" (Remarks on Sentence at p 5).

34His Honour went on to note that two or three days later, after the applicant's initial detection and escape, he committed the offence of attempting to possess the pseudoephedrine which, his Honour noted, was clearly an offence:

""... committed in circumstances where it bears a relationship to the process of manufacturing which had commenced as at 26 July. The importation of the pseudoephedrine had occurred a number of days before. Clearly the prisoner as at 26 July was expecting the delivery of the pseudoephedrine, as no doubt other people were as well. It is not an unreasonable inference to draw that the pseudoephedrine that the accused subsequently attempted to possess was destined for the process of manufacturing or a related process which was interrupted on 26 July."" (Remarks on Sentence at p 6).

35The sentencing judge observed that the circumstances of the set up of the laboratory, in relation to the manufacture offence, its isolated location, the means of delivery of the pseudoephedrine spoke of an organised criminal activity at work of which the applicant was an important player who had been given the responsibilities of looking after the process of manufacturing and taking delivery of the pseudoephedrine: Remarks on Sentence at p 7.

36Norrish DCJ noted that the applicant was 24 years of age at the time of the offences and was 25 years at the date of sentence. 

37In September 2005, he had been convicted of offences involving armed robbery with an offensive weapon; breaking, entering and stealing; larceny; taking and driving a motor vehicle; receiving stolen property and supply of prohibited drugs.

38There were four counts of supplying a prohibited drug taken into account on a Form 1 when the applicant was sentenced for the armed robbery.

39In relation to the subject offences, the applicant was given a 25% discount for his guilty pleas.

40In respect of the four offences committed, the applicant was sentenced on the bases detailed in paragraph [6] above constituting an overall term of 6 years 9 months with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months.

Principles

41The Crown accepted that parity as a ground of appeal may apply in cases where co-offenders are not charged with (or convicted of) the same offence: Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 59; Jimmy v R (2010) 77 NSWLR 540.

42However, as the Crown observed, it has been recognised that there can be significant practical difficulties in comparing the sentences of participants in the same criminal enterprise who have been charged with different offences: see Green v The Queen, supra, at [30]. 

43Before determining the ground of appeal relied upon by the applicant, I set out below specific aspects of the parity principle as enunciated by the High Court in Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 and Green v The Queen, supra: 

(1) It is obviously desirable that persons who have been parties to the commission of the same offence should, if other things are equal, receive the same sentence, but other things are not always equal, and such matters as the age, background, previous criminal history and general character of the offender, and the part he or she played in the commission of the offence, have to be taken into account: Lowe at 609.

(2) The parity principle allows for different sentences to be imposed upon like offenders to reflect different degrees of culpability and/or different circumstances: Green at [28].

(3) The consistency required by the parity principle is focused on the particular case and applies to the punishment of ""co-offenders"": Green at [29].

(4) The foundation of the parity principle requires that its application be governed by consideration of substance rather than form. Formal identity of charges against the offenders whose sentences are compared is not a necessary condition of its application: Green at [30].

(5) Nevertheless, as observed above, there can be significant practical difficulties in comparing the sentences of participants in the same criminal enterprise who have been charged with different crimes. The greater the difference between the crimes, the greater the practical difficulties, particularly where disparity is said to arise out of a sentence imposed on a co-offender who has been charged with an offence that is less serious than that of the appellant: Green at [30].

(6) In the exercise of the statutory powers of an appellate court, in appeals by convicted persons, a court may ""reduce a sentence not in itself manifestly excessive in order to avoid a marked disparity with a sentence imposed on a co-offender"": Green at [31] citing Lowe at 609-610.

(7) The sense of grievance necessary to attract appellate intervention with respect to disparate sentences is to be assessed by objective criteria. The application of the parity principle does not involve a judgment about the feelings of a person complaining of disparity. The court will refuse to intervene where disparity is justified by differences between co-offenders such as age, background, criminal history, general character and the part each has played in the relevant criminal conduct or enterprise.

(8) Where there is a marked disparity between sentences giving rise to the appearance of injustice, it is not a necessary condition of a Court of Criminal Appeal's discretion to intervene that the sentence under appeal is otherwise excessive: Green at [32].

Comparative Analysis

44The co-offender Matthews was charged with one count that between 27 May 2008 and 29 July 2008 he imported a commercial quantity of the border controlled precursor pseudoephedrine intending that either he or another person would use it to manufacture a controlled drug.

45The offence was, as earlier noted, one contrary to s 307.11(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth). The offence carried a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. Matthews was convicted on this charge on 18 March 2011 by a jury after a five-week trial.

46In determining the issue of ""equal justice"" in relation to the sentencing of the applicant and Matthews and whether or not the facts establish a legitimate or justifiable sense of grievance in the applicant in relation to the sentencing of Matthews the following matters are to be taken into account:

(1) Matthews was the principal in the importation of the pseudoephedrine secreted in the water pump. However, unlike the applicant, he was not also charged with knowingly taking part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug. In other words, unlike the applicant who was sentenced on other offences as particularised in paragraph [6] above, Matthews was dealt with solely on the basis of having imported a commercial quantity of precursor.

(2) The sentence Matthews received in relation to the importing of pseudoephedrine in the water pump was a period of imprisonment of 7 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months. In contrast, the applicant's attempted receipt of the pseudoephedrine in the same water pump resulted in a sentence of imprisonment of 3 years and 9 months overall with a 3 year non-parole period. The notional starting point for that sentence (prior to the 25% discount for the applicant's plea) was 5 years (in contrast to the term of imprisonment of Matthews after trial of 7 years and 6 months).

(3) The longest sentence which the applicant received was in relation to the manufacture charge being a period of imprisonment of 5 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 3 years (this offence as earlier noted carried a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment). The notional starting point for that offence (prior to the 25% discount for the applicant's plea) was 7 years. A finding was made by the sentencing judge that it was likely that the water pump contained pseudoephedrine originally intended for the manufacturing processes carried out at Ariah Park.

(4) The process of manufacture at Ariah Park had actually commenced prior to the receipt of the pseudoephedrine in the water pump.

(5) Although the applicant faced two significant charges, one in relation to the manufacture, and the other in relation to the attempted receipt of the pseudoephedrine, the notional starting point for the applicant for both offences (7 years) was still lower than the sentence imposed on Matthews of 7 years and 6 months.

(6) The applicant did not have favourable subjective circumstances. It is clear that he had been an important participant in the manufacturing operations that had commenced at Ariah Park. The sentencing judge stated that he was not a person who he could say was unlikely to re-offend in the future or even had good prospects of rehabilitation. In contrast, Tupman DCJ considered that Matthews' prospects of rehabilitation were reasonable.

(7) Both the applicant and Matthews had committed their offences whilst on parole, that being a serious aggravating feature of both cases. Unlike Matthews, it was an added fact in that the applicant persisted in performing his role in receiving the water pump even after he had been arrested in relation to the manufacture offence following which he escaped from police custody. As the Crown observed ""being an escapee at the time did not deter the applicant from continuing to participate only a couple of days later"": Crown Written Submissions at [26].

47In the consideration of the issue of parity in relation to the applicant's co-offender, Garcia, the following matters are to be taken into account.

(1) Garcia pleaded guilty to two counts. 

(2) In relation to count 1 - aiding and abetting Matthews in the importation of the border controlled precursor, pseudoephedrine - Garcia was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months.

(3) In relation to count 2 - an offence of knowingly taking part in the manufacture of the drug methylamphetamine - he was sentenced to a concurrent term of 3 years 2 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years.

(4) Garcia's involvement in relation to the importation offence was that he aided and abetted Matthews. He was not a principal in the enterprise. He received a combined discount of 20% in relation to his plea and assistance to authorities. He also faced a charge, similar to the applicant, of knowingly taking part in the manufacturing process at Ariah Park. 

(5) Garcia was known to be a person with knowledge and expertise in cooking methylamphetamine from pseudoephedrine. He had travelled with Matthews to Thailand and Nepal together in May 2008, returning on 13 June 2008. The purpose of that trip was to assist Matthews in arranging for the acquisition of the pseudoephedrine and to organise its shipping to Australia knowing that it was to be used in the manufacture of methylamphetamine.

(6) Garcia also assisted Matthews acquire the prohibited drug and in the arrangements to import it and place it in the water pump.

(7) He attended at the post office to send money through to the shipping agents to have the water pump cleared through customs. On 26 July Garcia went to Ariah Park and gave some instructions to the applicant on how to cook the methylamphetamine. The police raid took place shortly thereafter.

(8) In respect of the offence of knowingly take part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug, Garcia was therefore the person who had the knowledge as to how to cook methylamphetamine and who gave the instructions referred to in (7) and was the person to pass the imported substance on to the applicant. The sentencing judge, Tupman DCJ, stated that absent Garcia's guilty plea, an overall period of 4 years imprisonment would have been called for: Remarks on Sentence at p 39.

(9) The Crown observed that, unlike the applicant, Garcia did not have the serious aggravating feature of being on conditional liberty at the time of his offences.

(10) The applicant had been released on parole for the armed robbery offence in August 2007 and still had 1 year 5 months of the parole order left to serve at the time of committing the abovementioned offences and, as noted above, persisted in offending even after he had escaped from police custody. These features were not present in the case of Garcia.

(11) Whilst Garcia had a criminal record, it did not contain prior matters with the same degree of seriousness as the applicant.

Submissions

48In the submissions for the applicant it was noted that Matthews had been found guilty in relation to a different offence to those with which the applicant had been charged. Counsel for the applicant noted, however, that formal identity of charges is not a prerequisite for the application of the parity principle: Green v The Queen, supra.

49Whilst the charges against Matthews and the applicant differed, it was submitted that it was relevant to take into account that in relation to the charge under s 307.11(1) against Matthews, that Matthews was the organiser/principal of the importation of the pseudoephedrine which the applicant attempted to possess.

50Attention was also drawn to the fact that the offence with which Matthews was charged carried a maximum penalty of 25 years as compared to the maximum penalty of the applicant's charges (respectively 15 years and 10 years).

51Some reliance was placed upon the fact that the term of imprisonment imposed upon Matthews (7 years and 6 months) was just six months greater than the starting point used by Norrish DCJ in respect of the applicant's offence of knowingly taking part in the manufacture offence (that is before a discount of 25% for the applicant's pleas).

52It was further noted that the non-parole period to which the applicant was sentenced for each of the drug matters, namely, a period of 3 years, was just 1 year and 6 months less than Matthews' sentence.

53The Crown submission was that, given the differences in the circumstances at sentencing concerning the applicant and the co-offenders Garcia and Matthews, there was no basis for any justified sense of grievance concerning the sentences imposed on the applicant arising by reason of the application of the principles of parity. As discussed below, I accept that submission.

Conclusion

54The parity issue in the present case arises in circumstances in which careful attention is to be given to the particular offences with which the applicant and his co-offenders were charged and the individual circumstances giving rise to the criminality involved in the offences. In particular, the aggravating circumstances concerning the applicant to which reference has been made above is a matter of central importance.

55Account of course, must also to be taken of the subjective matters concerning the applicant and those of his co-offenders.

56I have additionally taken into account the different maximum penalties prescribed in respect of the various offences as discussed above.

57In all the circumstances, I do not consider that grounds exist for a justifiable sense of grievance on the basis of alleged disparity of the sentences imposed upon the applicant and those imposed upon his co-offenders, Matthews and Garcia. In particular, no marked disparity has, in my assessment, been established.

58The sentence imposed on the applicant in respect of his offence of attempt to possess the imported pseudoephedrine was part of the same enterprise in which Matthews and Garcia were engaged, and clearly involved a significant level of criminality.

59Matthews was clearly the organiser and principal of the enterprise. Garcia's role was undoubtedly significant in that enterprise.

60Whilst the co-offender Matthews was sentenced on the charge of importation the applicant was charged with the two offences in respect of his involvement in both the manufacture process as well as the attempted receipt of the pseudoephedrine. Both involved a significant level of criminality.

61Although the applicant's role was less than that of Garcia in the enterprise involving Matthews, I do not consider the difference between the total term of the respective sentences or the relevant non-parole periods can be said to give rise to or represent a marked disparity. The applicant was intending to use the imported precursor in the manufacturing activities that in turn were found to form part of an organised criminal activity. Additionally, in comparison with Matthews and Garcia his subjective circumstances were very unfavourable.

62Notwithstanding the seriousness of the applicant's two offences under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, the starting point in the sentencing exercise concerning the applicant was still less than the sentence imposed on Matthews. The applicant's involvement in the drug manufacturing was, as Norrish DCJ found, that of ""an important player"" in an operation that spoke of ""organised criminal activity at work"".

63Taking into account all matters discussed above, I do not consider that any marked disparity between the sentences imposed upon the applicant and his two co-offenders has been established.

64In those circumstances, I propose the following orders:

(1) Order an extension of time for the filing of the application for leave to appeal.

(2) Order that leave to appeal be granted.

(3) Order that the appeal be dismissed.

65DAVIES J: I agree with Hall J.

2706616,KJS v R [2013] NSWCCA 132,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:Offence and sentenceOn 2 May 2011 the appellant was indicted on a charge that on 14 April 2009 he had murdered his wife.  Upon being indicted on that charge before the jury, he pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter.  That plea was not accepted by the Crown and the trial proceeded.
2The issue at trial was provocation.  There was no issue that the appellant killed his wife in the bedroom of their home at Fairfield West by beating her about the head with a plumber's tool, known as a ""leadbeater"" on 14 April 2009.
3The trial commenced on 2 May 2011 and the jury returned its verdict of guilty to murder on 25 May 2011.  The appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for 20 years with a non-parole period of 15 years to date from 14 April 2009.
4This is an appeal against conviction only.  The appellant relies upon two grounds:
Ground 1:  His Honour erred in failing to direct the jury that before they could use the allegation that the appellant had sexually assaulted his daughter against him, they would have to find that he committed the offence as a fact beyond reasonable doubt.
Ground 2:  His Honour erred in failing to direct the jury with respect to the appropriate manner of dealing with lies, which were available as demonstrating a consciousness of guilt of a premeditated killing, and therefore murder not manslaughter.
Factual background and evidence at trial
5The factual background was summarised by the trial judge, Hidden J, in his remarks on sentence at pars [4] - [19] upon which the following is based.  In order to understand the evidence, it is necessary to briefly summarise the competing cases at trial.
6The Crown case was that on the morning of the incident, it became clear to the appellant that his wife intended leaving him and he became angry.  It was the Crown case that the appellant was not provoked to the extent that he lost self control.  The Crown submitted that in a planned attack, the appellant ambushed or surprised the deceased and struck her heavily over the head with the leadbeater.  He then placed a doona over her head and struck her a number of times resulting in her death.  The Crown submitted that evidence regarding the actions of the appellant immediately after the deceased was struck, did not support a loss of self control.
7The appellant's case was that in July 2008 his eldest daughter, who was nearly 17 years old, left home and shortly afterwards accused him of sexually assaulting her over a period of 5 years.  The appellant denied the claims and his wife, the deceased, believed him and fully supported him.  It was the appellant's case that it was not the actions of the daughter which led to him killing the deceased, but that those allegations were merely background to what happened.  The appellant submitted that it was years of mistreatment by the deceased, combined with what she had said to him that morning, which provoked him to kill her.
8The appellant said that on the morning of the incident, he and the deceased started arguing.  During the course of that argument, the deceased said ""I picked you over ISS (the daughter)"".  The appellant took that to mean that the deceased did not believe him any more.  This meant that the only real support he had ever had was now gone and it was implicit in what the deceased said, that she was calling him a paedophile.  He tried to plead his innocence with her but the deceased said ""That's it, I'm taking you for everything, I'm taking the house, I'm taking the kids and I'm taking the car off you, the whole lot"".  She pushed him with both her palms and he tripped over.  He felt angry when he fell over.  When he got up, he ""saw red"".  He did not remember getting the leadbeater or hitting the deceased over the head.  The last recollection he had, was her standing near the doorway of the en suite.  He was not able to recall anything concerning the attack after that.  It was the appellant's case that the loss of self control was brought about by the actions and words of the deceased, some in the space of seconds and some over the space of years.
9The appellant and the deceased began a relationship in 1990.  Their daughter, ISS, the subject of the sexual assault allegations, was born the following year.  By then the relationship had broken up.  They got together again about four years later and married in 1996.  They had two more children, a boy and a girl.
10The evidence of family members and friends was that the appellant was a quiet, reserved person whereas the deceased was a strong personality, outgoing and feisty.  Their relationship appeared to be normal.  However, the appellant gave a different account of their interaction in the privacy of their home.  He said that the deceased was very much the dominant party in the relationship and that she was controlling of him and sometimes aggressive towards him.  She did not get on with his family and, out of loyalty to her, he limited his contact with them.  He said that he did not disclose any of this to others because it would have been wounding to his ego to do so.  
11His evidence, broadly supported by the witnesses, was that he was never violent towards her.  There was an occasion in 2005 when he was very angry with her and ""trashed"" the bedroom of the house in which they were then living and destroyed items of her property and personal effects.  This appears to have been an isolated incident.  There was also evidence that she told a friend of hers that he could be violent towards her.
12The eldest child, ISS, left home in 2008 due to domestic violence issues with the deceased.  She later made allegations of sexual assault against the appellant covering five years between 2003 and 2008.  The first complaint about this matter was made in 2008, a short time after she left home.  A formal complaint was made to DOCS in April 2009.
13ISS gave evidence at trial.  Without going into the detail of her evidence, she alleged a pattern of sexual interference which began with indecent touching and progressed to sexual intercourse, attempted or completed.  She said that she told no-one about this behaviour until after she had left the family home in 2008.
14ISS said that for a considerable period of time, the deceased refused to believe her allegations and strongly supported the appellant in his denial of any such conduct.  However, her position changed in the early months of 2009 leading up to the killing.  It seems that as time passed, the deceased wanted to heal the breach with her daughter and sought mediation between January and April 2009.
15By April 2009, the appellant had been charged with the offences arising from the daughter's allegations.  Originally these offences were on the same indictment as the murder charge, until severed from the indictment at the commencement of the trial.
16By Easter 2009, the marriage between the appellant and the deceased was in serious trouble.  Apart from the deceased's suspicion about the appellant's sexual assault on their daughter, she came to believe that he was having an affair.  This arose from his contact with an old girlfriend on Facebook on Thursday, 9 April.  They argued about the matter and he denied having an affair.  There was talk of divorce on his part.  The atmosphere in the home was tense.
17The family had planned to spend the Easter weekend with friends on the Central Coast.  As a result of the argument, the appellant did not go and the deceased travelled to the Central Coast with the two younger children.  However, the deceased and the two children returned on Sunday night, 12 April because she was unwell.
18The appellant gave evidence that on Monday, 13 April there was further talk of divorce and the atmosphere between them remained tense, but otherwise nothing of note occurred.  In particular, there was no confrontation between them.  In the early evening of that day, he sent a text to his employer saying that he had ""bad family problems"" and would be off work for the rest of the week.  Later that evening, the deceased sent a text message to one of the friends with whom she had been staying on the Central Coast saying ""the shit hit the fan"".  Later that same evening, she called the same friend and spoke to him about the appellant wanting a divorce.  According to the friend, they spoke for about ten minutes and she did not sound frightened or upset.
19On the morning of the incident, 14 April, the appellant's work truck was collected by his employer.  Records indicate that the deceased paid a water bill at 7am.  By 8am she was dead.
20The appellant's evidence concerning that day was that he slept downstairs in the lounge-room.  When he woke up, he went upstairs to the bedroom he shared with the deceased.  The atmosphere had not improved and they argued.  He said that he wanted to go away so that they could try to sort things out.  She said that she hated the way he treated her and that he did not care about her or the children.
21The appellant's evidence was that the following conversation took place.  He said ""Don't forget I picked you over my parents, over my family"".  By that he meant that he had put up with the fact that she resented his family and, even though that resentment was unjustified, he had supported her.  She retorted that she had picked him over their daughter.  He took that to mean that she no longer supported him in his denial of their daughter's allegations and in fact believed that she was telling the truth.  He pleaded his innocence of the allegations but she said ""That's it, I'm taking you for everything"".  She said that she would be taking the house, the children, the car, ""the whole lot"".  She pushed him.  He tripped over something and fell.  He got up and as he put it, he ""saw red"".
22The appellant said that he accepted that it was then that he seized the leadbeater and attacked her with it, although he professed to have no memory of doing so.  The leadbeater was a tool which he had possessed for some time in his trade as a plumber, although he did not use it in the course of his employment at the time.  His evidence was that before they moved to the home at Fairfield West, the deceased used to keep a baseball bat in their bedroom for protection, presumably against intruders, but that was misplaced when they moved house and he gave her the leadbeater to replace it.
23The younger children were present in the house at the time.  They did not give evidence at the trial, but videotaped police interviews with them were played to the jury.  The effect of their evidence, particularly that of the young girl, was that the appellant walked up the stairs to the main bedroom and returned quite shortly thereafter looking shocked and ""rushed"".  They did not hear anything suggesting a violent incident, such as raised voices or the sound of fighting.  The appellant said that their mother had ""gone back to sleep"".  He put them into the family car and drove them to the home of an aunt and asked her to look after them for a few hours.
24In the early afternoon, he spoke to members of his family by mobile phone.  The effect of what he told them was that he had killed the deceased and that he was going to burn the house down and kill himself.  His sister contacted the police who went to the home.  When they arrived he said ""My life is over.  You might as well arrest me now"".  He said that he had killed the deceased and that she was upstairs in the bedroom.  He was conveyed to Fairfield Police Station, where he admitted having struck her with the leadbeater.  In evidence, he did not deny that he made that admission but claimed to have no memory of it.
25The deceased was lying on the floor of the bedroom near the en suite, and the bloodstained leadbeater was lying next to her.  Underneath her upper body was a doona, which was bloodstained.  A physical evidence officer noted that there was no sign of spatter from projected blood in the area, as might have been expected.  He thought it likely that this was because her head was covered by the doona, either before the attack or at least after the initial blow.  The appellant accepted that he had done that, although he could not remember it and could not offer any explanation for it.
26Consistently with the phone conversation with members of his family, the police found a jerry can of petrol in the house, a newspaper of that day's date, a torn up ""Application for Divorce Kit"", together with the torn remains of a letter.  They found two further handwritten notes in the car, one of them addressed to the younger children.  The torn up note was later able to be reconstructed.  It said:
""I have no remorse.  This is what I've chosen to do.  This is the only way I could stop her.""
27The effect of the other documents was an expression of his intention to commit suicide and an explanation of his actions by reference to his daughter's allegations which he denied and the deceased's domination of him in their relationship.
28It was the appellant's case at trial that the comment by the deceased ""Well I picked you over ISS"" was central to his case on provocation.  He took that to mean that the deceased no longer believed him and accepted their daughter's allegations.  The jury were invited to assess the daughter's evidence because (on the appellant's case) whether or not she was telling the truth was relevant to the gravity of the provocation occasioned by what he alleged the deceased said.  If he were innocent of any sexual wrongdoing, what she said to him would be more hurtful than if he were not.  Conversely, if he were guilty of the sexual assaults, the deceased's change of allegiance and support of the daughter would have made it more likely that he would then be prosecuted and convicted of those offences, thereby providing a more powerful motive for him to deliberately murder his wife in the premeditated manner contended by the Crown.
29When it became clear that the appellant's daughter was going to give evidence at trial, even though the sexual assault count had been severed, the trial judge made the following observation (T.17.40):
""HIS HONOUR:  I gave a little thought to this overnight, but the question would be, if evidence of the sexual assault is led, the question would be whether any special directions should be given about it, because given the jury will not be asked to bring any verdict in relation to the sexual assault allegations, is it  simply no more than the matrix of the provocation and does the jury have to be given a direction about the standard of proof that they should apply in considering the sexual assault allegations?  It is just part of the factual matrix and it is for that very reason I am aware of giving the conventional direction, that a person who has been charged, but he is still innocent.  I don't think the presumption should have any part to play, but I am thinking aloud.  I am flagging the things that are troubling me today.""
30The jury was then empanelled, without the issue having been determined.  The Crown opening (T.33 - 40 of 4.5.2011) did not advance any theory of the case.  The opening was factually based and related to a series of events and forensic findings.
31There was a defence opening at T.41.  The jury was told that the issue for determination was provocation and that the partial defence of provocation was founded on two factual or evidentiary bases.  Counsel for the defence said:
""The first basis is an unhappy relationship between the accused and the deceased over the years.  The second basis is something said by the deceased, shortly before she was killed by the accused, that the accused interpreted as meaning that the deceased believed that something that their daughter, ISS, had said was true.""  (T.41 - 42.1)
On the first basis, counsel for the defence said:
""The case for the accused is that there was a slow burn, years of unhappiness, ill treatment and resentment, and that that played its role in the loss of self control that led to the death of the deceased.""  (T.42.39)
32In relation to the second basis, counsel for the defence said:
""The deceased said something to the accused that he interpreted as meaning that the deceased believed the complainant"".  (T.42.12)
Counsel for the defence went on to say:
""It is my case that shortly after the deceased said that, and a few other things having been said by her, the accused lost self control and killed the deceased.  So that is the issue as to why you will be hearing about the alleged sexual offences from ISS, not to find him guilty or not guilty of them, but so that you can better understand the central defence of provocation.""  (T.42.27)
33The appellant's daughter, ISS, gave evidence at trial.  Counsel for the defence specifically put to her that the appellant had never sexually or indecently assaulted her and that she had fabricated the allegations in this regard.  The appellant gave evidence at trial denying his daughter's allegations.
34The question of the directions to be given, with respect to the daughter's evidence, arose again at the conclusion of the evidence and before counsel's addresses.  The trial judge said (at T.610, 19.5.11):
""But the other question is really, given that the issue of ISS's credibility does arise, what directions should I give the jury about proof of her allegations?  Is there a call for any particular direction, or is it simply part of the whole body of evidence which they must consider when determining the issues of provocation and, in particular, the gravity of the provocation?
Should there be the customary warning about later complaint or the customary directions about complaint?
But I leave those things for you to think about and I would appreciate your assistance on those.""
35Counsel for the defence sought a Murray direction (at T.613, 20.5.11) about scrutinising the evidence of ISS with great care, to which the Crown agreed.  Such a direction was given in due course.  
36Counsel for the defence then said:
""Your Honour I just wanted to repeat my submission that the jury should be told that before they act upon the evidence of ISS, they should be satisfied of it beyond reasonable doubt.
Now what I say in support of that is, it is not an indispensable, intermediate fact, a Shepherd fact, I accept that.   Nor is it tendency evidence that needs to be proven beyond reasonable doubt before it can be taken into account.  I accept that as well.
...
But the only point I wish to draw from those propositions is that the criminal law does identify facts or aspects of evidence that in certain circumstances need to be proven beyond reasonable doubt before they can be used and in my submission the situation here is analogous to those categories.""
37The trial judge refused the application (at T.620, 23.5.11) in the following terms:
""I do not propose to give that direction and I think it is inappropriate in the loose analogy of cases dealing with links in the circumstantial chain and in cases of tendency evidence.  Nevertheless, they are cases where the evidence at hand is evidence directly bearing on the conduct charged.  That is not the case here.  I think, frankly, the direction you propose is inappropriate for a start.  I think it may also be confusing to the jury.  I propose to do no more than direct the jury, as we have agreed, to scrutinise ISS's evidence carefully and to give a direction along those lines.""
38The direction ultimately given to the jury was:
""Now the important part of the case is ISS's evidence alleging that the accused sexually assaulted her over a period of some years.  He is not on trial before you in relation to those allegations obviously and you won't be asked to deliver any verdict in respect of them.  The relevance of the evidence is this.  Firstly, this is a case where it is obvious that the whole background leading up to the events of 14 April is important, and an important part of that background is the allegations ISS made of sexual assault by her father, and her mother's reaction to those allegations.  This is of particular importance when you come to consider the question of provocation.  Remember from the accused's evidence that a significant part of what the deceased said to him that morning was ""I picked you over ISS"".  The accused said he took that to mean that after having supported him for so long, and told everyone she didn't believe ISS's allegations, she was now saying she did.  As the accused saw it, she was really saying ""I was protecting you but I actually believe her"".  The accused went on to say that he protested his innocence of those allegations to her that morning.
It is for that reason that it is not merely the fact of the allegations that is important, it is whether there is any truth in them. ISS gave evidence of the history of sexual abuse which she alleges, and you'll have to make an assessment of that evidence and decide whether you accept her evidence or not.  If the accused was provoked by his wife saying to him ""I picked you over ISS"", you could imagine the provocation would be all the worse if in fact he were innocent.  If he had not sexually assaulted ISS then her saying in effect ""I believe you did"" would have had a real sting in its tail, you might think.  It would have less sting in its tail, you might think, if in fact he had sexually assaulted ISS.
That is not to say that provocation would be out the window if you accepted ISS.  It would still be a matter for you to determine whether in all the circumstances he was provoked so as to lose his self control by what his wife said, even if he was guilty of sexually assaulting ISS.  It would be open to you to say, even if he was guilty, nevertheless, he may well have been deeply affected by his wife saying in effect ""I believe ISS"" when for so long she supported him and said she didn't.  
So whether you accept ISS's evidence of the allegations of sexual assault is a matter bearing upon the gravity of the provocation the accused may have felt by what his wife said to him that morning.  When you come to assess ISS's evidence, you should approach it remembering that she makes very serious allegations against the accused, that those allegations stand or fall by her evidence alone.  There is no other evidence tending to confirm what she said.  And for those reasons you should examine her evidence carefully and evaluate it carefully.  ...""  (S/U 13-14)
APPEALGround of Appeal 1
39The appellant developed his submission as follows.  The jury in the summing up was simply told that this matter was relevant to the question of an assessment of the level of provocation.  If they found that the allegations were false then the wife's change of allegiance would have caused even greater upset to the appellant.  Nothing was said to the jury about how they could use the sexual assault offence if the jury found that the offence had been proved.
40The appellant submitted that the Crown specifically adopted his guilt in relation to the sexual assault offence as part of its case, even putting to him that he had in fact sexually assaulted his daughter.  Upon adopting the stance that other criminal conduct was relevant to the jury's determination of the guilt of the appellant, the jury should have been directed that the appropriate standard of proof in this regard was a finding to be made beyond reasonable doubt.  The appellant submitted that inherent in the Crown's adoption of his guilt of this other criminal conduct was that his guilt in this regard constituted a step in the proof of the prosecution case. 
41This was because it provided a clearer and more powerful motive for murder on the basis that if the deceased left him, it was likely she would support their daughter with respect to these allegations which would have led to his prosecution, conviction and lengthy imprisonment for the sexual assaults.  The appellant submitted that this was why the jury should have been directed that before they could rely upon the fact of the appellant's commission of this other criminal conduct, they would have to find that it had been proved beyond reasonable doubt.  In that regard, the appellant relied upon the observations of Hayne J in HML v The Queen; SB v The Queen; OAE v The Queen [2008] HCA 16; 235 CLR 334 at [196] and the more general observations of McCallum J in David L'Estrange v The Queen [2011] NSWCCA 89 at [78] - [84].
42There are a number of difficulties with the appellant's submission.  The first is that which was freely conceded at trial, namely that there is no authority in support of it.  More importantly, it was never a part of the Crown case, either expressly or implicitly, that proof that the sexual assaults had taken place constituted a step in the proof of the prosecution case.
43The existence of the allegations of sexual assault was a fundamental part of the defence case, not that of the Crown.  For the provocation to be made out, it was important for the defence for the fact of the allegations to be raised.  Once the fact of the allegations was raised, the background evidence concerning them also had to be raised.  The Crown's interest in the sexual assaults was restricted to its need to negative that they had the effect contended for by the appellant, i.e. that they caused him to lose control.
44When attention is directed to what it was that the appellant wished to establish, and what the Crown was required to do in order to negative provocation, the observation by the trial judge to the effect that a ""beyond reasonable doubt"" direction in relation to the sexual assault matters was inappropriate and would probably be confusing to the jury is shown to be correct.
45As counsel for the defence said in the trial, on more than one occasion, the case of provocation was not based on sexual assault alone, it was also based on what was described as years of mistreatment.  Counsel for the defence said in his closing address:
""Let me be quite clear about that; it was not the actions of the complainant that led the accused to kill the deceased, it was the actions and words of the deceased.  The allegations of the complainant are merely background to what happened.""  (T.650.38, 23.5.11)
46Ultimately the truth of the allegation of sexual misconduct was irrelevant.  It was the fact that it was raised by the deceased and the appellant's response thereto which had to be evaluated by the jury.  The defence case did not depend on the truth of the allegation, but the fact that it was made.  What mattered on the defence case was that the deceased had changed her position and was now saying, according to the appellant, that she believed the allegations to be true.  It mattered not whether the appellant was guilty of the sexual assaults or not, the deceased's change of position would still have caused him significant hurt in that it would have left him standing alone in the family, disbelieved and without support.  The issue for consideration by the jury was the loss of self control, not whether the allegations that brought it about were true.
47The Crown was obliged to put to the appellant in cross-examination that he had sexually assaulted ISS because that was the evidence given by her in chief.  The Crown did not thereby assume an onus to prove the allegation beyond reasonable doubt.  It remained throughout the trial a disputed question of fact relevant to a fact in issue, the resolution of which was independent of the issue of provocation.  It was not an intermediate necessary fact or a link in a chain that the jury had to decide beyond reasonable doubt before they could draw other conclusions. 
48This was accepted by the defence at trial.
49L'Estrange does not assist the appellant.  The real issue in L'Estrange was the admissibility of the evidence and the factual background was quite different.  HML involved a much more complex factual background, with conflicting statements of principle related specifically to those facts.  The more general statement of Gleeson CJ in that case at [31] supports the Crown position here, i.e. ""there was no general principle that whenever, in a criminal trial, the prosecution sets out to prove, as a fact relevant to a fact in issue, that some criminal conduct occurred, that fact must be established beyond reasonable doubt"".  In any event, the prosecution did not set out to prove nor did it need to prove in this case that the sexual assaults had taken place.
50This ground of appeal has not been made out.
Ground of Appeal 2
51The appellant submitted that it was fundamental to the Crown case that the appellant had sexually assaulted ISS and that his denials in this regard were lies.  The appellant submitted that it was the Crown case that his whole story about the argument with the deceased acting as provocation was a fabrication and that he had deliberately planned to kill her.  The appellant submitted that it was part of the Crown case that the appellant was not to be accepted when he said that he had conveniently forgotten the details of the killing of the deceased.
52The appellant submitted that it was inherent in those submissions that the appellant had fabricated this evidence because of a realisation of his guilt of a premeditated murder, as opposed to manslaughter.  The appellant submitted that as a result the lies relied upon by the Crown should have been precisely identified, so that his Honour could direct the jury as to the terms of the alleged lies and the manner in which the Crown relied upon those lies as demonstrating consciousness of guilt.  This was particularly important with respect to the alleged lies involving his denials of sexual assault.
53There is a certain unreality in this ground of appeal.  It was never fundamental to the Crown case that the appellant had sexually assaulted ISS.  This was not at any time asserted. It was the Crown case that his story about an argument acting as provocation was a fabrication.  It was also part of the Crown case that the appellant had not forgotten the details of the killing.  These latter aspects, however, were not relied upon as lies indicating a consciousness of guilt.  That was never asserted, either expressly or implicitly, as part of the Crown case.  On the contrary, the Crown relied upon a series of facts which placed in doubt the assertions by the appellant, so as to negative the defence of provocation.
54It was the Crown case that there were facts which were inconsistent with the appellant claiming loss of self control.  
1. The only evidence of provocation came from the appellant.  In  order to negative that evidence, the Crown adduced evidence of the surrounding circumstances:
(a) His quick recovery from the incident (evidence of the children).
 (b) Driving the children to the aunt's place.
(c) Throwing a doona over the deceased to contain the blood spatter.
(d) Moving the deceased's body from the en suite area (consistent with self control).
 (e) The absence of any screaming.
 (f) The short period the appellant was upstairs.
(g) The evidence of the divorce kit and the torn up note (indicating a prior intention to leave the marriage).
2. The appellant's account of the incident at trial included a loss of memory about critical facts and times, which was consistent with a loss of control.  The Crown sought to negative this by the evidence of him being calm and relaxed when spoken to by people at the time, including the police.
55These were matters which were properly raised by the Crown in closing address.  The Crown was doing no more than contrasting the account given by the appellant with what it said were the established facts.  These raised live credibility issues which would need to be evaluated by the jury.  This was not a case of the Crown relying upon the telling of lies as indicating consciousness of guilt.  At no time did the Crown assert that lies told by the appellant had that effect.  If those facts were accepted by the jury, they would negative provocation.
56The observation in Dhanhoa v R [2003] HCA 40; 77 ALJR 1433 at [34] (Gleeson CJ and Hayne J) succinctly sets out the applicable principle:
""It is not necessary for a trial judge to give a direction either of the kind referred to in Edwards, or the kind referred to in Zoneff, every time it is suggested, in cross-examination or argument, that something that an accused person has said, either in court or out of court, is untrue or otherwise reflects adversely on his or her reliability.  Where the prosecution does not contend that a lie is evidence of guilt, then, unless the judge apprehends that there is a real danger that the jury may apply such a process of reasoning, as a general rule it is unnecessary and inappropriate to give an Edwards direction.  Zoneff was said to be an unusual case and the direction there proposed was said to be appropriate where there is a risk of misunderstanding about the significance of possible lies.  The present was not such a case.""
57That observation in Dhanhoa is directly applicable to the facts of this case.  Moreover, there is no reasonable possibility that the verdict of guilty would have been different if the trial judge had given a direction concerning lies.  To have given a direction about lies might not only have emphasised the issue, but made it more difficult for the jury to disregard consciousness of guilt as an issue.  Finally, the issue was not raised at trial and no basis has been put forward which would justify rule 4 being dispensed with and it being properly raised here.
58Not only has this ground of appeal not been made out, but I would refuse leave to rely upon it.
59The order which I propose is that the appeal be dismissed.
60LATHAM J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
61BARR AJ:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

		07 June 2013",2013-06-06 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2706617,R v GLYNATSIS [2013] NSWCCA 131,"JUDGMENT
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:  On 12 December 2012 the respondent was sentenced by Johnson J in respect of nine counts of insider trading, contrary to ss1043A(1) and 1311(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).  Five of the nine charges were ""rolled up"" charges involving multiple insider trading transactions.  Each offence carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years and/or a fine of $220,000.
2His Honour imposed sentences as follows:
(a) In respect of each of counts 1 to 5 - sentenced to imprisonment for 12 months commencing 12 December 2012 and expiring 11 December 2013.
(b) In respect of each of counts 6 to 9 sentenced to imprisonment for 12 months commencing 12 December 2013 and expiring 11 December 2014.
3His Honour directed that the sentences were to be served by way of intensive correction in the community.  The conditions of that intensive correction order (ICO) were to include the mandatory conditions prescribed by the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 (the CAS Act), the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Regulation 2008 (the CAS Regulation) and that the respondent was to report on or before 19 December 2012 to the Department of Corrective Services.
4The gaol sentence of 2 years imprisonment was to be served by way of 768 hours of community service (24 months at 32 hours per month).  The Crown has appealed from that sentence on the following grounds:
Ground of Appeal 1 - His Honour erred in assessing the seriousness of the offences by the approach taken to the sums invested, the profits obtained and who was to benefit from the illegal trading in that his Honour:
(a) Erroneously concluded that the respondent's trading on behalf of relatives was a significant factor that operated in his favour (Remarks on Sentence at [161]);
(b) Erroneously placed either equivalent weight or greater weight on the profits obtained rather than greater weight on the sums invested (Remarks on Sentence at [159] and [171]).
Ground of Appeal 2 - His Honour erred by imposing sentences with an aggregate duration of 2 years imprisonment and by directing that those sentences be served by way of intensive correction in the community and thereby:
(a) Failed to give proper effect to the need for general deterrence; and/or
(b) Failed to give proper effect to the principles of totality, having regard to the seriousness of the offending conduct for each of the nine separate offences;
Ground of Appeal 3 - The sentences imposed were manifestly inadequate.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
5The respondent was born in January 1983.  He obtained a Bachelor of Law and Bachelor of Business Administration degrees from Macquarie University in 2005.  He commenced but did not finish a Diploma in Financial Services from Kaplan Professional in 2010.
6In February 2007 the respondent commenced employment with PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and by July 2009 had become a senior consultant in the Research and Development Section of their Tax and Legal Department.  The nine offences for which he was sentenced were committed between November 2009 and 2010.
7The respondent resigned from PwC in June 2011 following the detection of the offences that are the subject of these proceedings.
8During his employment at PwC, the respondent had access to a business process and record management system called Documentum, which housed caches of files relating to (amongst other things) PwC's clients and the various projects in respect of which PwC had been retained to provide advice.  Unless access to a client file or project stored on Documentum had been specifically limited, all Documentum users had access to that information.
9The respondent had exclusive use of a laptop, provided to him by PwC which was protected with a username and password unique to the respondent.  This laptop contained a program which enabled the respondent to access the Documentum data base and to also automatically save the documents he viewed.  It recorded the date and time at which he viewed them.    
10Between November 2009 and November 2010, the respondent accessed confidential PwC documents on Documentum identifying proposed transactions involving PwC clients, such as corporate takeovers which contained inside information, and then shortly afterwards traded in shares and Contracts for Difference (CFDs) which are ""derivatives"" under the Corporations Act 2001.  The respondent had no legitimate work-related reason to access these documents and at all relevant times, he was aware that his actions in accessing them and subsequently trading, contravened various PwC policies and were illegal.
11The respondent was personally involved in all of the trading, the subject of these proceedings, by placing orders over the internet through either a trading account held with CMC Markets Asia Pacific Pty Ltd in his own name or three separate trading accounts held by relatives (relatives' trading accounts).  These were accounts in the names of Michael Glynatsis, his uncle, Irene Glynatsis, his sister, or in the names of Michael Glynatsis and his business partner, Peter Nicola.
12The respondent traded through his relatives' trading accounts as their agent, although not pursuant to any formal agency agreement.  Each of the relatives gave the respondent permission to trade through their accounts and provided him with their user names and passwords for this purpose.  Each of the relatives was broadly aware of the respondent trading through their accounts but not of the specific details of each particular trade.  All of the trades through the relatives' trading accounts were conducted by the respondent on their behalf and for their financial benefit.  It was not alleged that any of the relatives were complicit in the respondent's offences.  It was common ground that the respondent did not derive any financial benefit from any trades conducted through his relatives' trading accounts.
13By way of summary:
(a) Counts 3 and 4 related to trading only on his own account.
(b) Counts 5, 6, 8 and 9 related to trading only on the accounts of his relatives.
(c) Counts 1, 2 and 7 related to trading on both his own account and on those of relatives.
14The offending involved numerous transactions over a period of 12 months involving the acquisition on his own, or on account of his relatives, of financial products (shares or units or CFDs in respect of shares or units) in eight companies trading on the ASX.  Those transactions were rolled up into nine counts on the indictment.  The confidential inside information accessed related on all but one occasion to an impending takeover of the relevant company.
15Count 1 related to Challenger Kenedix Japan Trust (CKT).  Between 20 November 2009 and 2 December 2009, the respondent acquired through his own trading account 58,000 CFDs in respect of units in CKT and acquired for his relatives' trading accounts 48,700 units in CKT.  The acquisition of the CFDs produced an exposure of $42,950 and the acquisition of the units cost $27,971.  On 9 December 2009, after the public announcement of the takeover, the respondent disposed of all of the units and CFDs in CKT for a total consideration of $94,658, which produced a total gross profit of $23,737, made up of $13,600 for the respondent and $10,137 for his relatives.
16The second count related to Hastings Diversified Utilities Fund (HDF).  Between 11 March 2010 and 17 March 2010 the respondent acquired through his own trading account 9,000 CFDs and through one of his relative's trading accounts, 10,000 units in HDF.  The acquisition of the CFDs produced an exposure of $11,250 and the acquisition of the units cost $12,250.  The takeover did not occur and between 23 March and 8 April 2010 the respondent disposed of all of the units and CFDs in HDF for a total consideration of $23,880, which produced a total gross profit of $380.  The transaction produced a loss of $120 for the respondent and a profit of $500 for his relatives.
17Between 5 May and 7 May 2010 the respondent acquired for his own trading account 40,000 CFDs in respect of units in HDF, which resulted in a total exposure of $51,550.  The proposed takeover did not eventuate.  On 13 May 2010 the respondent disposed of all of his CDFs in respect of units in HDF, resulting in a gross profit for him of $2,225.
18The third count related to Brockman Resources Ltd (BRM).   On 3 May 2010 the respondent acquired through his own trading account 10,000 CFDs in respect of shares in BRM, resulting in a total exposure of $33,400.  The proposed takeover did not take place.  On 4 May 2010 the respondent disposed of all of his CFDs in respect of shares in BRM resulting in a gross loss of $4,400.  
19The fourth count also related to BRM.  Between 10 May and 13 July 2010 the respondent acquired a total of 31,000 CFDs in respect of shares in BRM, resulting in a total exposure of $90,355.  Between 10 May 2010 and 13 September 2010 the respondent disposed of his 31,000 CFDs in respect of shares in BRM, which resulted in a total gross profit for him of $3,851.
20The fifth count related to Ferrous Limited (FRS).  Between 18 May and 6 July 2010 the respondent acquired through his relatives' trading accounts 10,000 shares in FRS.  The proposed takeover did not occur.  On 24 June and 22 September 2010 the respondent disposed of all of the 10,000 shares in FRS which resulted in a total gross profit for his relatives of $475.
21The sixth count related to Apollo Gas Ltd (AZO).  On 24 September 2010 the respondent acquired through one of his relative's trading accounts 18,300 shares in AZO.  On 29 September 2010 the respondent disposed of all of the AZO shares resulting in a gross profit for his relatives of $4,392.
22The seventh count related to Dominion Mining Ltd (DOM).  Between 12 and 19 October 2010 the respondent acquired through his own trading account 11 CFDs in respect of shares in DOM for a total exposure of $31,586.  In the same period he acquired through one of his relative's trading accounts 4,300 shares in DOM for a total cost of $12,040.  Between 21 October and 3 November 2010 the respondent disposed of all of the shares and CFDs in respect of DOM for a total consideration of $49,519 which resulted in a gross profit of $5,893, comprising $4,164 for the respondent and $1,729 for his relatives.
23The eighth count related to Caledon Resources Ltd (CCD).  Between 22 September and 3 November 2010 the respondent acquired 24,500 shares in CCD through two of his relatives' trading accounts for a total cost of $29,017.  Between 9 and 12 November 2010 the respondent disposed of all of the shares in CCD, resulting in a gross profit for his relatives of $9,753.
24The ninth count related to Exoma Energy Ltd (EXE).  The confidential information related to the taking over of various exploration permits.  Between 17 and 23 November 2010 the respondent acquired through one of his relative's trading accounts 40,000 shares in EXE for a total cost of $10,000.  On 23 December 2010 the respondent disposed of all of the shares in EXE, resulting in a gross loss to his relatives of $600.  
25In relation to all of these transactions, it was common ground that the respondent knew that the insider information in his possession was not generally available and of its impact upon a reasonable person if it were.  It was also common ground that the respondent was a ""true insider"" in that he was in an inside position when he possessed and used inside information and not just an outside recipient of inside information.  It was accepted that his conduct was thereby a serious breach of the trust bestowed upon him by his employer.
26The transactions yielded total gross profits of $50,826 or an overall gross benefit (after deducting losses incurred on some trades) of $45,706.  Of that amount, the respondent derived on his own account a gross profit of $23,840 and on account of his relatives, $26,383.  This yield was the result of investing a total amount of $371,507.
Sentence proceedings
27The primary judge made the following findings in relation to the respondent's personal circumstances:
28He was aged 27 - 28 at the time of the offences and 29 at the time of sentencing.  He was unmarried and had no prior criminal history.  The respondent gave evidence in the sentencing hearing.
29In relation to the effect of the offending on the respondent's career, his Honour said:
""117 ... I will proceed to sentence the offender upon the basis that his convictions for these offences will have a terminal effect on his capacity to work as a legal practitioner and in the area of financial advice in the future.""  (ROS 23)
30The respondent was born in Greece and came to Australia with his parents and younger sister when he was aged 7.  When he was aged 10, his mother left the family and returned to Greece.  The respondent had been close to his mother and her departure had an unsettling effect.  To some extent, his paternal grandmother filled the void left by his mother.  She looked after him in conjunction with his father until he was aged 14.
31His Honour accepted that the respondent was a hardworking and studious young person, working in his father's fish and chip shop while he was at school.  In years 11 and 12, the respondent helped his father run a Greek restaurant in Terrigal.  The respondent was successful in his Higher School Certificate and undertook tertiary studies.  He continued to work part-time in the family restaurant as a kitchen hand and cook and as a general manager while he was at university.
32The respondent's father had remarried when the respondent was aged 16 (1999).  A daughter was born of that union, who was aged 11 at the time of sentencing.  The respondent's father and his second wife divorced in 2009.  This resulted in stress and tension across the whole family, culminating in the father's bankruptcy in February 2010, as well as the loss of the family house.
33The respondent's sister, Irene, confirmed the family's difficulties in 2009.  The sentencing judge summarised her evidence as follows:
""125 ... She stated that she and the offender commenced to look for a house for her father and his young daughter to occupy.  A place was found in October 2010 with a settlement in December 2010.  She confirmed that the offender had placed most of the deposit on the purchase of the house for his father and half sister.  This provides some context for the offences committed by the offender in 2010.""  (ROS 24)
34Since his resignation from PwC in June 2011 the respondent had done some work as a bar manager, which was work organised by his sister.  At the time of sentencing, he was residing with his father and half-sister on the Central Coast.  He was working for his father.  
35The sentencing judge had a psychologist's report before him.  In November 2011, the respondent was being treated for depression and anxiety.  That treatment continued into 2012.  The diagnosis was of adjustment disorder and depressed mood. The psychologist noted that initially the respondent had rationalised his behaviour, but as the result of treatment, had come to acknowledge that his actions were illegal.  The psychologist thought that the respondent had demonstrated remorse.  The psychologist considered the respondent's future prospects to be sound because of his expression of remorse and contrition.  He believed that the likelihood of the respondent coming before the Court again was extremely low.
36In relation to the respondent's personality, the psychologist said:
""128 ... [He] had come to appreciate the fact that he has been depressed for many years dating to childhood, that he had not come to terms with his parents' failed marriage, and that he took on the role of protecting the family name and pleasing his father by excelling academically and caring for his younger sister.""  (ROS 25)
37The sentencing judge accepted that the respondent was contrite and remorseful for his actions and had accepted full responsibility for them.  His Honour said:
""134 ... Whilst it is the case that he did not give a full account of his actions when they were initially under investigation in 2011, he has readily accepted responsibility for his offences, agreeing to the facts upon which he is to be sentenced which includes an express acceptance that he knew what he was doing to be wrong at the time.""  (ROS 26)
38The sentencing judge accepted that the respondent felt a level of pressure to assist his father during the serious financial difficulties which affected him in 2010.  His Honour thought this provided some context for the offences.  His Honour also accepted that there was in part a desire by the respondent to please those family members on whose behalf he was trading.  His Honour noted that the respondent was, however, also obtaining some benefit for himself.  His Honour found the respondent to have been a hardworking, young person who did not appear to be someone who had sought to ""live life in the fast lane"", as sometimes occurs with offenders in this class of crime.  His Honour stressed that these findings did not operate as an excuse for the respondent's criminal conduct but provided some context for the exercise of the sentencing discretion.  
39The sentencing judge reviewed why insider trading offences are regarded as a serious form of criminal activity.  They served to undermine the integrity of the stock market and were difficult to detect.  General deterrence was important to provide a clear disincentive for such offences.  Not only did insider trading have the capacity to undermine the integrity of the market, it also had the potential to undermine confidence in the commercial world generally, arising from breaches of trust.  His Honour noted that the cases have emphasised the particular gravity of offences by a ""true insider"" who abuses the office or employment which he or she occupies, to take advantage of information acquired in the course of that employment.  His Honour noted that insider trading was not a form of victimless crime but was a form of cheating.
40The sentencing judge accepted that a 25 percent discount was appropriate because of the early plea of guilty.  He took account of the respondent's agreement to an order under s 116 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth), for payment of $50,826 as evidence of the respondent's co-operation with the authorities.  His Honour did, however, note that while the respondent's co-operation was not immediate it commenced at an early point in time and was described by ASIC as being of ""significant value"".
41In relation to the respondent's motivation for the offending, the sentencing judge said:
""160 The Crown submitted that the fact that some of the securities were purchased on behalf of the offender's relatives was of no particular importance in this case.  The offender had permission from the relatives to access their trading accounts and he did so.  Mr Hastings QC submitted that this aspect was of significance in this case.
161 I am satisfied that the trading on behalf of relatives is a significant factor which operates in the offender's favour in this case.  For reasons mentioned earlier, it shed some light upon the offender, his thought processes and his family background.  I keep in mind as well the existence of clear family financial difficulties affecting the offender's father in 2010 and the various steps which the offender and his sister were taking on his behalf.
162 In raising these matters I am not suggesting that the offender was acting as a form of ""white knight"", for noble reasons to assist his family in committing these offences.  There was an element of personal gain as well."" (ROS 31)
42In relation to the extent of the insider trading, the sentencing judge said:
""158 In each instance the securities were sold yielding total gross profits of $50,826 or an overall gross benefit of $45,706.  Of that amount the offender derived, on his own account, a gross profit of $23,840 and his relatives derived a profit of $26,386.
159 It is necessary to keep in mind that the total amount invested was $371,507.  This is an important indication of the gravity of the offences:  R v Doff at [31] (ROS 30)
...
171 The Crown submits that it is most important that the sum invested by the offender in these offences totalled $371,507, a sum far in excess of the nearest comparative case being the sum of $174,755 in R v O'Brien.  I accept that this is a factor to be taken into account on sentence, although it is also important that the gross benefit in this case was the sum of $50,826 with that sum subdivided as between the offender and his relatives.  The gross benefit in the case of R v O'Brien was $54,748.""  (ROS 33)
43Ultimately, his Honour found that the comparison with other cases while helpful, was not decisive in the sentencing exercise which required that he impose a sentence which was individualised to the particular offender, the context in which the offences occurred and the circumstances of the offences themselves.  His Honour said:
""184 I have concluded that no sentence other than a term of imprisonment is appropriate in the circumstances of the case.  To impose a lesser sentence would not reflect the seriousness of the offender's crimes, or give proper effect to applicable sentencing principles to which I have made reference.
185 I have had regard to the principles of accumulation, concurrency and totality.  I accept the Crown submission that the offender's conduct cannot be treated as a single episode of criminality.  There are a number of offences committed over a period of time.  I consider that a measure of accumulation is appropriate, although I am satisfied that the total sentence of imprisonment should not exceed two years.
186 In my view, the appropriate sentencing outcome will involve concurrent sentences of imprisonment of 1 year with respect to each of the first to fifth offences, commencing today, 12 December 2012, and expiring 11 December 2013.  With respect to the sixth to ninth offences, concurrent sentences of imprisonment for 12 months will be imposed, commencing on 12 December 2013 and expiring on 11 December 2014.""
APPEALGround of Appeal 1
44The Crown submitted that the sentencing judge erred in concluding that the respondent's trading on behalf of relatives was a significant factor that operated in his favour.  His Honour's observations in that regard are set out at [41] hereof.  In support of that proposition, the Crown relied upon the observation of Whealy J in R v McKay [2007] NSWSC 275; 61 ACSR 470 at [55]:
""...  The fact that the beneficiaries on count 2 and, in particulars 1 and 2 of count 3 were family members is of no great warrant; similarly, with count 1, where there was a possible contemplation that Georgia McKay might be the ultimate beneficiary.  In all three instances, the position is similar to the offender receiving the benefits of the trades herself (R v IR Hall [No 2] (2005) NSWSC 890 at [86]).""
45The reference to Hall, is a reference to a decision of Kirby J where his Honour said:
""86 I am ultimately concerned with Mr Hall's criminality.  In determining that issue, it makes no difference in my view whether Mr Hall held shares personally, or whether they were held by family members.  It was clear on the evidence that Mr Hall was the driving force behind The Store of Knowledge Pty Limited.  It was a family investment vehicle.  His family's interests were his interests.  He sought throughout to protect his and his family's interests.""
46The Crown also relied upon R v Nguyen [2004] NSWCCA 332; 149 A Crim R 343 at [55] where Spigelman CJ (with whom Barr and Hoeben JJ agreed) said:
""Ellis DCJ distinguished a number of authorities in this Court on the basis that the offences had been committed by some person with a view to them obtaining monetary gain for themselves.  However, personal advantage can take many forms.  Greed may be regarded as a less worthy motive than protection of a family member.  The latter is no less a form of personal gain to an offender and, often, is a more powerful motive.  Protection of the system of criminal justice should not be significantly less vigilant where its perversion is attempted for reason of family ties, rather than the expectation of monetary gain.""
47I am not satisfied that the sentencing judge erred in the way submitted by the Crown.  It should be noted that the finding by his Honour was made in answer to the Crown submission at trial that the fact that some of the securities were purchased on behalf of the offender's relatives, was of no particular importance in this case.  It was well open to his Honour to reject that proposition on the facts of this case.  Moreover, the statements of principle upon which the Crown relies deal with different factual circumstances.  In both Hall and Nguyen, there was an identity between the offender and those benefiting from the offence.  That was the way that Whealy J characterised the matter in McKay.
48The situation was quite different in this case.  There was no evidence of any identity between the relatives whom the respondent sought to benefit and himself and such was not suggested.  The evidence was important as being confirmatory of the context in which the offending occurred, i.e. a misguided attempt to restore his family's fortunes.  The distinction between an offence committed for motives of personal greed and committed for the benefit of some other person is real.  This is not to say that such a circumstance is exculpatory, rather it can indicate a less serious level of criminality as it did in this case.  That having been said, his Honour was well aware of the confounding issue in this case, i.e. that in some of the transactions there was an element of personal gain involved.
49The effect of what his Honour was saying was that this was an important factor in the appellant's favour.  He did not suggest that it was a decisive factor or the most important factor, but it was a factor which needed to be taken into account.
50The Crown submitted that his Honour erred by giving greater or equivalent weight to the size of the profits obtained from the insider trading when comparing that to the magnitude of the sums invested.   The paragraphs of the remarks on sentence which are criticised are at [42] hereof.  The Crown submitted that it was clear from these paragraphs that at the very least, his Honour was giving equivalent weight to the amount of profit and the amount invested.  The Crown submitted that such an approach was erroneous.
51In making that submission, the Crown relied on the observations of Barr J in Regina v Robert Bart Doff [2005] NSWSC 50; 23 ACLC 317 at [31] where his Honour said:
""It seems to me that the amount invested is a more important indicator of criminality than the amount ultimately realised from the criminal activity concerned. One would not regard as trivial the criminality of an insider trader who ventured much but lost.""
52The Crown based its submission on the following considerations.  The damage to the integrity of the market occurs when the investment is made, regardless of the profit ultimately realised.  The profit or benefit ultimately derived from insider trading is often a relatively unimportant indicator of criminality because it is almost invariably determined by chance and events occurring, or failing to occur, after the commission of the offence.  Such events are beyond the offender's control.  
53The Crown submitted that the outcome of the trades, the subject of the second, third, fourth and fifth counts, provide good examples of the latter circumstance.  The Crown submitted that the profit gained by an insider trade transaction, governed as it is by chance, is a poor and crude indicator of the criminality involved in such offences.  It submitted that the criminality ought not be determined to any significant extent by unpredictable chance of this kind.  The Crown submitted that the amount invested is a product of design, whether directed to a prospective profit or some other motivation and therefore a superior indicator of criminality.
54I agree with the Crown's analysis.  Clearly profit is a relevant factor and was properly taken into account by his Honour.  It could become an important factor if for a comparatively small investment, a very large profit were made.  In most situations, however, the better indicator of the extent of the criminality must be the size of the transaction and the best way of assessing that is by reference to the amount of money invested, or placed at risk.  
55Accordingly, while his Honour was correct to take both matters into account as factors relevant to criminality, the more important factor was the total amount invested or put at risk.  To the extent that his Honour failed to acknowledge this, he was in error.  It is not an error which appears to have significantly influenced the exercise of his Honour's sentencing discretion.  
Ground of Appeal 2
56The Crown submitted that the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment, to be served by way of intensive correction in the community, involved four steps.
(1) A determination as to whether having considered all possible alternatives, no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate in all the circumstances of the case;
(2) If so, a preliminary determination as to whether such a sentence of imprisonment is ""likely"" to be for a period of no more than two years, so as to warrant a referral of the offender, pursuant to s69(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) for assessment as to his or her suitability for intensive correction in the community.
(3) A determination of the appropriate length of the term of imprisonment at the final sentence hearing and;
(4) If, and only if, the overall duration of sentence arrived at is no more than 2 years imprisonment, a determination as to whether the sentence of imprisonment should be the subject of an ICO.
57In relation to that process, the Crown relied upon the observation of Howie J in Regina v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [23] where his Honour said:
""23 ...  Each step requires the court to consider the objective gravity of the offence balanced against the subjective circumstances of the offender, but it is the first of those considerations that will principally determine which of the available sentencing alternatives the court should adopt. This is because at the end of the day the sentence must be commensurate with the seriousness of the crime: R v Geddes (1936) 36 SR (NSW) 554; R v Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 594.""
58The Crown submitted that s69 is silent as to the question of concurrent and cumulative sentences and therefore does not require the sentencing judge to consider questions of totality and accumulation at the point of determining whether to refer an offender for assessment.  The Crown submitted that a determination under s69(2) that the sentence was likely to be for a period of no more than two years, did not absolve the sentencing judge from the requirement to consider questions of accumulation, concurrency and totality when determining the terms of imprisonment to be imposed prior to determining whether a sentence ought be served other than by way of fulltime imprisonment.  The Crown submitted that s69(2) did not permit a sentencing judge to determine the length of imprisonment after he or she had selected the manner in which it was to be served.
59The Crown submitted that his Honour was required first to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of accumulation or concurrency, as well as questions of totality.  It submitted that it was only after that point, that the manner of serving the sentence, whether by way of home detention, ICO or suspension might properly arise if the sentence arrived at was short enough.  The Crown relied upon Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 at 624 to support that proposition:
""46 Sentencing is not a process that leads to a single correct answer arrived at by some process admitting of mathematical precision. It is, then, all the more important that proper principle be applied throughout the process. 
47 Questions of cumulation and concurrence may well be affected by particular statutory rules. If, in fixing the appropriate sentence for each offence, proper principle is not applied, orders made for cumulation or concurrence will be made on an imperfect foundation. 
48 Further, the need to ensure proper sentencing on each count is reinforced when it is recalled that a failure to do so may give rise to artificial claims of disparity between co-offenders or otherwise distort general sentencing practices in relation to particular offences.""  (Emphasis added by the Crown)
60That statement of principle by the Crown is, of course, unexceptionable.  The issue is whether the sentencing judge failed to follow that process in some respect.
61The Crown submitted that his Honour did not follow that process and as a result, failed to give proper effect to the principles of totality by having regard to the seriousness of the offending conduct in respect of each of the nine separate offences. In that regard, the Crown referred to that which his Honour said at [43] hereof which, the Crown submitted, was the only time his Honour considered questions of cumulation, concurrency and totality.  The Crown submitted that his Honour advanced no reasons for the choice which he made.
62The Crown submitted that his Honour's determination of the terms of imprisonment was unsatisfactory in that he did not indicate the basis on which he imposed an identical term of imprisonment in respect of counts 1 and 5, when the amount of the investment in count 1 ($70,921) was almost 9 times that involved in count 5 ($7,975) and yielded a gross profit of $23,737 that was approximately 49 times the gross profit yielded in respect of count 5.  The Crown submitted that similar contrasts could be identified between the sentences imposed in respect of counts 4 and 5, counts 7 and 6, and counts 7 and 9.
63The Crown's criticism of the sentencing judge's approach on this basis is misconceived.  It involves an application of mathematical precision to what is a discretionary decision based on an intuitive synthesis of all the relevant factors to which his Honour referred. It is contrary to remarks in  Pearce on which the Crown relied at [59] hereof. Given the similarity in the steps taken by the respondent in relation to each offence, it was well open to the sentencing judge to structure the sentences as he did.
64The Crown submitted that it was difficult to discern the basis upon which his Honour determined which sentences were to be concurrent and which were to be cumulative.  Once again, this was a discretionary exercise on the part of his Honour which was open to him because of the similar nature of the offending.
65The Crown submitted that his Honour did not have due regard to the fact that most of the offences (counts 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9) were ""rolled up"" in the sense that they involved more than one illicit trade.  Many involved numerous instances of trading over relatively prolonged periods, and some also involved trading by the offender, through both his own trading account and one or more of his relatives' trading accounts.  Count 2 also consisted of two separate particulars involving one set of illicit trades in March 2010 and a different set of illicit trades in May 2010.
66In support of this submission, the Crown relied upon Regina v Shawn Darrell Richard [2011] NSWSC 866 where Garling J observed (at [65]) that offences which are rolled up charges, include more than one episode of criminal conduct, such that necessarily the criminality involved is greater than with a charge involving only one episode of criminal conduct.  His Honour said:
""105 The use of rolled up charges by the Crown is a matter of considerable advantage to an offender: R v Jones [2004] VSCA 68 at [13] per Charles JA (Phillips JA and Bongiorno AJA agreeing). The advantage to the offender is that the use of a rolled up charge restricts the maximum available sentence to that prescribed by the legislation for the single offence, rather than the total theoretically available maximum sentence from multiple charges. 
106 In this case, the Crown submitted that there was a public interest in presenting rolled up charges. It said that rolled up charges encouraged pleas of guilty and made more efficient the discharge of the Court's workload. It also submitted that presenting the indictment with two rolled charges provided an appropriate available maximum sentence which sufficiently reflected the underlying criminality of Mr Richard's criminal conduct. 
107 I acknowledge, as did Charles JA in Jones that a rolled up count can ease the task of a sentencing judge. It does so by limiting the number of separate charges upon which a sentence is necessary and, as a result, limits the range of sentences available. 
108 The other reason that there is a benefit to an offender who pleads guilty to a rolled up charge is that, as only one sentence is imposed for all of the episodes of criminality, the sentence in effect represents a complete concurrence of separate sentences which might otherwise have been imposed for those separate episodes of criminality. 
109 The fact that here the charges are rolled up charges is a relevant matter to which regard must be had in considering the principle of totality and, in particular, questions of concurrence and accumulation of the sentences to be imposed on the individual charges.""
67The Crown submitted that the significance of the ""rolled up"" counts in the present case was expressly addressed on sentence, but the sentencing judge did not refer to the issue in his remarks on sentence.  It submitted that inferentially, it appears that his Honour did not consider the different extent to which the individual counts encompassed multiple instances of offending when assessing issues of cumulation, concurrency and totality.
68The agreed facts made it clear that the acquisition of shares, units and CFDs referred to in each count occurred as a result of a number of separate transactions.  Accordingly, the whole of the conduct of the respondent, including those transactions, is relevant to the necessity for general deterrence and, in that respect, to the assessment of totality.  It is not clear to what extent, if at all, the sentencing judge took account of this other conduct that was ""rolled up"" in the counts to which the respondent pleaded guilty.  
69The Crown submitted that in relation to the mode of serving the sentences imposed by his Honour, insufficient regard was had to the important principle of general deterrence.  The Crown submitted that general deterrence was one of the most important principles to be observed in this area of offending.  This is despite the fact that it is not specifically referred to in s16A(2) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).  
70The Crown submitted that there was clear authority to this effect:  R v El Kahani (1990) 21 NSWLR 370 at 377; R v Thomas [1998] 3 VR 188 at 200.  The Crown submitted that general deterrence was such an important consideration because white collar offences are difficult to detect, investigate and prosecute successfully: R v Pantano [1990] 49 A Crim R 328 at 330.  In R v Doff [2005] NSWCCA 119; 54 ACSR 200 the Court (Wood CJ at CL, Adams and Bell JJ) said:
""56 ... We do not, in this respect, suggest that anything other than a stern approach should be taken to offences of insider trading for the reasons earlier identified.  It remains a serious offence, and there needs to be a considerable deterrent aspect reflected in order to protect the integrity and efficacy of the market.  Those in a position of trust who receive price sensitive information in relation to securities are expected to confirm to exacting standards of honesty, and transgression can normally be expected to lead to custodial sentences as well as to pecuniary penalties.""
71The Crown submitted that his Honour appeared to be overly influenced by the three decisions in which ICO's had been imposed on offenders by the Courts, i.e., R v Bateson [2011] NSWSC 643; R v Dalzell [2011] NSWSC 454; 83 ACSR 407 and R v O'Brien [2011] NSWSC 1553; 91 ACSR 374.  The Crown submitted that while the subjective circumstances of the three offenders in those cases and the present respondent were reasonably similar, the objective circumstances, including the number and nature of the insider trading offences varied significantly.  The Crown submitted that the objective circumstances of the offending in the present case was more serious than any in those three cases, yet all four offenders received identical aggregate sentences, being the prescribed maximum limit for an ICO.
72In the appeal, the Crown presented a schedule which set out a comparison of those three cases with the facts of this case.  Important points of dissimilarity were that in Dalzell and Bateson only one count was involved, in O'Brien four counts, but in this case nine counts.  In Dalzell the offending had taken place over one day, in Bateson over four days, in O'Brien over six and a half months, and in this case over 12 months.  In Dalzell and Bateson one company was involved, in O'Brien four companies and in this case, eight companies.  In Dalzell and Bateson the amount invested was between $52,000 and $53,000, in O'Brien $203,000 and in this case, $371,000.  The Crown submitted that O'Brien represented the outer limit for offences for which an ICO would be appropriate, but that the objective circumstances of the criminality in this case was such as to render an ICO entirely inappropriate.
73The Crown acknowledged that an ICO represented a substantial punishment.  Nevertheless, it noted the observation in R v Pogson; R v Lapham; R v Martin [2012] NSWCCA 225 by McClellan CJ at CL and Johnson J (with whom Price, RA Hulme and Button JJ agreed) at [108] to the effect that an ICO is a punishment that reflects a significant degree of leniency because it does not involve immediate incarceration.  The Crown submitted that the practical effect of the ICO in this case, was that the respondent must undertake a minimum of 32 hours community service per month and must seek the permission of the Commissioner or parole authority, if he wished to leave or remain out of the State or Australia respectively.  None of the other standard conditions would have any relevance to him (clause 175 of the CAS Regulation).  The Crown submitted that such a sentencing outcome did not properly acknowledge the importance of general deterrence.
74I have concluded that there is considerable force in this submission.  While I do not accept that the sentences themselves, their structure and the extent of concurrency and cumulation were not open to his Honour, I do accept the Crown submission that the mode of serving those sentences by way of an ICO does not adequately meet the principle of general deterrence, given the nature of the criminality and its seriousness in this case.
75I have concluded that the respondent should be re-sentenced by this Court to a term of fulltime custody, because no other sentence will adequately reflect the seriousness of the offences.  Given the objective seriousness of the offending and the circumstances of the respondent, the degree of leniency reflected in this ICO, together with a sentence of 12 months for counts 1 to 5, is outside the range of sentences that adequately reflects the need for general deterrence.  For that reason, I am also satisfied that a more severe sentence is warranted, which greater severity can be reflected by altering the nature of the sentence to be imposed and the length of the sentence to be imposed for counts 1 to 5.  I propose to impose a total sentence of 1 year and 9 months, with appropriate reductions being made for the time that he has been subject to an ICO.  
76I am required to determine the minimum period that justice requires that the respondent spend in custody in accordance with the principles in Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [36] - [45].  Having regard to the weight of the mitigating factors set out by the sentencing judge and the unlikelihood that the respondent will ever re-offend, I consider that the minimum term should be 12 months.
77I would propose the following orders:
(1) The Crown appeal is allowed.
(2) The sentences passed on the respondent on 12 December 2012 are quashed.
(3) In lieu thereof, the respondent is sentenced as follows:
(a) With respect to each of the insider trading offences contained in Counts 1 to 5 on the indictment, the respondent is sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 15 months, commencing 12 December 2012 and expiring on 11 March 2014.
(b) With respect to each of the insider trading offences contained in Counts 6 to 9 on the indictment, the respondent is sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 12 months, commencing 12 September 2013 and expiring on 11 September 2014.
(c) The Court directs that the respondent be released on 11 December 2013 being the expiration of 12 months of that sentence on a recognisance that he be of good behaviour during the balance of the term, upon him giving a security in the sum of $1,000 without surety.
78ROTHMAN J:  I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL, in draft, and, for the reasons given by his Honour, I agree with the orders he proposes.  I also agree with the additional comment of McCallum J.
79McCALLUM J: I agree with the orders proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL and with his Honour's reasons.  The acquisition or disposal of financial products by people having the unfair advantage of inside information is criminalised because it has the capacity to unravel the public trust which is critical to the viability of the market.  It is, as previously observed by this Court, a form of cheating.  The fact that people of otherwise good character and compelling personal circumstances are tempted to engage in such conduct emphasises the need for the clear deterrent that insider traders should expect to go to gaol.

2706623,SW v R [2013] NSWCCA 103,"Judgment

1McCLELLAN JA: The applicant was tried with a co-accused, her husband BW, before R A Hulme J and a jury for the murder of their seven-year-old daughter, ""Ebony"", contrary to s 18(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. The offence carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment: Crimes Act s 19A(1). As Ebony was under 18 years at the time of her death, the standard non-parole period for the offence is 25 years: Item 1b of the Table in Division 1A of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

2On 23 June 2009, the jury found the applicant guilty of murder. BW was found not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter contrary to s 18(1)(b) of the Crimes Act. Manslaughter carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment: Crimes Act s 24. 

3On 2 October 2009, the trial judge sentenced both the applicant and BW. The applicant was sentenced to life imprisonment. BW was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 16 years, with a non-parole period of 12 years. 

4The applicant raised two grounds of appeal against conviction and one against sentence. The grounds of appeal are as follows: 

Ground 1: 

(a) His Honour failed to appropriately direct the jury as to how they could use the evidence of the accused alleged lies (sic).

(b) His Honour erred in his comment as to the lack of alleged corroboration (and therefore her lack of credibility) as to the applicant's claimed state of mind during the time of the child's deteriorating health leading up to her death. 

(c) His Honour failed to direct the jury as to how they could use the evidence of the conduct capable of being construed as evidencing consciousness of guilt. 

(d) His Honour failed to direct the jury with respect to the alleged lies told to her husband. 

Ground 2: His Honour failed to direct the jury that before they could convict the appellant upon murder they had to be satisfied the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was not so intoxicated as a result of prescribed drugs she was taking alone and/or in combination with other matters she said were affecting her state of mind as to be able to form the specific intent necessary for murder. In other words, to thereby realise that her child was probably going to die. 

Sentence Ground 1: In all the circumstances the sentence imposed was too severe.

Background

5It is necessary to set out the background to the offence and the events at the applicant's trial that are said to have given rise to a miscarriage of justice. It will be necessary to quote passages, sometimes lengthy, from the trial judge's summing-up.

6A detailed summary of the background to the offence is set out in the judgment of Whealy J in BW v R [2011] NSWCCA 176, a decision of this Court dealing with an appeal brought by the applicant's husband against his sentence for manslaughter. The Crown also supplied me with its own summary of the facts. I have drawn on both in preparing the following. 

7The applicant and BW were married on 7 May 1992. They had four daughters, including the deceased. The eldest, CW, was born on 15 September 1992. TW was born on 22 March 1994. Ebony was born six years later on 22 March 2000. The youngest, BrW, was born on 2 March 2002. 

8From the time of her birth Ebony experienced a series of physical and developmental problems. She weighed only 2.9 kilograms at birth. In the first few years of her life she failed to thrive or meet developmental milestones. She was diagnosed as having a global development delay, a diagnosis given to children who experience delay in two or more important areas of development. During this time her weight was abnormally low. She was slow to begin crawling and was still unable to walk when she was 22 months old. She also struggled to develop verbal communication skills. At 34 months of age she was assessed as functioning as a child of 13 to 16 months. 

9The Department of Community Services (""DOCS"") had ongoing involvement with the family from at least 2002. In June of that year, when BrW was only 13 weeks old, she was removed from the care of her parents by DOCS because of a ""failure to thrive"". The term ""failure to thrive"" is used to refer to children whose current weight or rate of weight gain is significantly lower than that of other children of similar age and gender. Despite the removal of BrW and a number of visits by DOCS to the family home, no community services officer saw Ebony at any time. 

10By the time that Ebony was four years old she was gaining weight at a normal rate, though her weight was still below average. By the time she was five, she weighed 19.6 kilograms and was described by a specialist as ""a well nourished short girl"". Around that time, in April 2005, Ebony was formally diagnosed with autism and was prescribed medication. Very little attempt was made by her parents to provide her with such medication. 

11In February 2006 Ebony was admitted to Sydney Children's Hospital for a hernia repair. She weighed 20.5 kilograms at that time. At trial, evidence was tendered that had her weight continued to increase at a normal rate it would be expected that she would have weighed approximately 26 kilograms at the time of her death in November 2007. In March 2006 Ebony made her last visit to a medical professional when she saw a general practitioner to receive vaccinations. The doctor described Ebony as being ""quite a chubby six year old"" at that time.

12By the time that she was six years old, Ebony still had not commenced school. In August 2006 the applicant obtained a certificate from a general practitioner excusing her from attending school for the rest of that year due to her global development delay. 

13The applicant, BW and the three daughters still in their care resided in a Department of Housing property in Matraville, New South Wales, from 2001 until August 2007.

14The family's neighbours at the Matraville address gave evidence at trial. A woman who lived next door gave evidence of seeing Ebony outside the home on only one occasion, in May 2006. On this occasion the neighbour thought that Ebony was a ""healthy, chubby looking girl"". Otherwise, the neighbour only ever saw Ebony in her bedroom, the window of which faced her home. She never saw anyone else with Ebony in the room and gave evidence that Ebony appeared to be left in the room for lengthy periods of time with the door closed. In late 2006 or early 2007 the window to Ebony's room was broken and repaired with a piece of plywood. Although the neighbour could still hear Ebony, she did not see her again after this time.

15In April 2007 the Department of Housing visited the home and found it to be ""in a putrid state"". Another neighbour of the applicant gave evidence that she went into the house at Matraville soon after the family moved out in August 2007. She said that Ebony's room had piles of faeces in the corner and that the room had a bad smell of faeces and urine.

16In August 2007 the family relocated to a privately rented home in Hawks Nest. The last known person to see Ebony alive, outside of her immediate family, was a removalist engaged to transport the family's belongings to their new home. He was told not to go into Ebony's room at Matraville as she was autistic and would be upset if woken. He later saw Ebony in one of the rooms in the Hawks Nest home. He described her as being ""unusually skinny"" and believed that she looked about three years of age. She was in fact aged seven years and five months at the time. 

17At 7.00am on the morning of Saturday, 3 November 2007, the applicant found Ebony dead in her room. At approximately 1.00pm that afternoon BW made a 000 call. NSW Ambulance Officers Adam Diamond and Timothy Kirkpatrick went to the home. The applicant told Officer Diamond that when she found Ebony the child was blue and not breathing. She said that she had attempted to resuscitate Ebony but the child had bull ants in her mouth. She said that she realised that there was nothing she could do and just sat with the child in her arms and sang to her for the next couple of hours. She said that as she could not handle what had happened, she took two Valium tablets and 20 Panadol tablets and went to bed. 

18Photographs taken at the scene show that Ebony's body was clothed and lying on a mattress on the floor. No sheets were fitted to the mattress. Her body was partly covered with a doona and a towel, both of which had dark stains on them. A second towel was found under her body. 

19At the trial, Dr Nadesan, a forensic pathologist who visited the home on the day Ebony was found dead, gave an account of the state in which he found the child. Dr Nadesan gave evidence that Ebony was ""wasted and dehydrated"" and ""in an extreme degree of emaciation"". He said that her corpse ""looked almost like a mummy to me"". He described her clothing and bedding as being heavily stained with vomit, faecal matter and other bodily fluids that appeared to have accumulated over a period of time. The room smelt strongly of urine and he could detect other unpleasant odours. 

20Dr Nadesan conducted a post-mortem examination of Ebony's body. Ebony weighed only nine kilograms at the time of death. This was approximately one third of the weight that it was predicted that she would attain in November 2007, had she continued to grow and be nourished as expected. Dr Nadesan concluded that Ebony's death was caused by ""starvation and neglect"". He further expressed the view that Ebony's death was the result of ""chronic"" rather than ""acute"" starvation. Dr Nadesan described chronic starvation as ""a periodical reduction in the administration of food and fluids and so forth - this kind of scenario will go on for several months before a person would succumb to it"".

21Dr Edward O'Loughlin, a specialist gastroenterologist at Westmead Children's Hospital, also gave evidence. He said that Ebony's death was the result of chronic malnutrition caused by starvation. He said that the starvation was, in turn, a result of profound neglect. Dr O'Loughlin said that the lack of food in the gastrointestinal tract indicated that it had been many hours or days since Ebony had last eaten solid food. He said it would have taken ""weeks"" at a minimum for a child to reach the stage Ebony was at when she died. Dr O'Loughlin said that he had treated many hundreds of children for malnutrition over many years, but he had never looked after someone so malnourished. He gave evidence that solid faecal matter or ""starvation stools"" were found in Ebony's bowels. He said that they had been there for a long time and that they indicated a lack of solid food intake for days to a couple of weeks. In Dr O'Loughlin's view, it would have been obvious to anyone observing Ebony shortly before her death that she was about to die.

22On 9 November 2007, police executed a search warrant at the Hawks Nest property. The police located a large quantity of prescriptions and prescription medication in the house. 

Evidence bearing on the applicant's state of mind

23Both the applicant and BW gave evidence that they were heavy users of drugs such as Valium, Panadeine Forte and Panamax. The applicant explained that she relied on the drugs to treat ongoing pain from a fall she had suffered in 1999 as well as anxiety problems dating back to 1992. She said that from 2005 to 2007, she was taking about 10 Panadeine Forte each day. Later in her evidence she said that, in the eight-week period at Hawks Nest, she would take eight to 10 Panamax, six to 15 Valium, two to six Voltaren Rapid, and eight to 12 Panadeine Forte on a daily basis. The applicant said that the drugs made her feel like she was in a ""dream-like state"", as if she ""wasn't really there"". She also gave evidence that the drugs slowed her down. In cross-examination, the applicant denied that she was lying about her drug intake so as to give the impression of ""being so zonked"" that she failed to notice Ebony's weight loss.

24Professor Graham Starmer gave evidence for the applicant. He agreed that the statement ""I wasn't really there, felt spacey and dream-like, as if things were not real"" (said by the applicant in evidence in chief) was consistent with a description by a person who might be using eight to 10 Panamax, six to 15 Valium, and eight to 12 Panadeine Forte per day. Professor Starmer said that simple tasks such as making a purchase would be relatively resistant to the effects of the drugs, although tasks involving judgment would be more affected. He conceded that diazepam, the active constituent of Valium, might affect a person's memory, but added that this had to be offset against the tolerance that the person may have developed. Professor Starmer cited fatigue, drowsiness, confusion and depression as other possible side effects of diazepam. He cited nausea, vomiting, constipation, dizziness, drowsiness and impaired mental and physical abilities as possible adverse reactions to the codeine component in Panadeine Forte. Professor Starmer again added that long-term use of either drug would lead to the build-up of a tolerance, with the result that the person would not suffer the same effects unless the dosage were increased. He gave evidence that a person under the influence of these drugs in sufficient quantities would still be able to perform simple or routine tasks to a competent standard, but might face difficulties in performing unusual or difficult tasks or tasks involving the exercise of choice. Professor Starmer said that a person such as the applicant, who took the drugs at different times throughout the day, would be less affected than a person who took the drugs all at once.

25The applicant gave evidence about her perception of Ebony's physical condition after the move to Hawks Nest. She said that she remembered Ebony being only ""a bit thinner"" than she was in 2005 and 2006. The applicant added that at no point prior to Ebony's death did she notice a distinct change in Ebony's appearance or conditioning. The applicant said that she had seen and was shocked by the autopsy photos of Ebony, although she ""didn't see her [Ebony] as being like that"" at any time before her death. Rather, the applicant said, she perceived Ebony to be the same ""chubby six-year-old child"" she was some 20 months earlier. The applicant said that at no time in the period between March 2006 and Ebony's death did she ever think there was any need for Ebony to see a doctor.

26The applicant also gave evidence about her psychological state at Matraville and Hawks Next. She said that from 2005, she felt very depressed and was distressed by the involvement of DOCS in the family's affairs. The applicant's depression continued after the move to Hawks Nest. She said that she did not feel appreciated and that she felt nothing she did was worthwhile. The applicant said that these feelings persisted up to the date of Ebony's death.

27The applicant gave evidence that two weeks before Ebony died, she had told BW that she ""was concerned about her with the vomiting and diarrhoea and also about her seeing a doctor"". According to the applicant, BW said in reply that Ebony had been through that before, that she would be fine, and that there was no need for her to see a doctor. The applicant agreed with BW's assessment. The applicant said that although Ebony's vomiting and diarrhoea continued in the two weeks before her death, she did not consider taking Ebony to a doctor because in her view the condition was insufficiently serious. The applicant said that sometime during this period, BW had said to her, as she was taking Ebony to bed, that ""if it [the vomiting and diarrhoea] kept up she might die"". The applicant told BW ""not to be silly and that she would be fine, she would come good"". BW denied in his evidence that these conversations took place.

28The applicant gave evidence that on Friday, 2 November 2007, the day before Ebony was found dead, she woke Ebony at about 4.00am and guided her by the hand to the lounge room. The applicant said that she lifted Ebony up and placed her on the lounge before going to the kitchen to heat Weetbix and muesli with which to feed Ebony. When the applicant came back to feed the child, Ebony indicated that she wanted to sit on the floor, so the applicant helped her move from the lounge to the floor. The applicant started to feed her, but Ebony had only a few teaspoons before pushing the bowl away. According to the applicant, Ebony was up for about an hour and a half to two hours. For most of this time she was lying down. The applicant said that she put Ebony back to bed sometime between 5.30 and 6.00am.

29The applicant said that she woke Ebony up again at about 6.00pm on the Friday. Again she held her hand as they walked down the hallway to the lounge room. The applicant placed Ebony on the floor and attempted to feed her soft food and some soft drink. At about 7.30pm, the applicant helped Ebony up, held her hand and walked her to bed.

30The Crown argued that the expert evidence had called into question the applicant's account of the events on the Friday night. In his evidence, Dr O'Loughlin doubted that early on the Friday morning Ebony would have been able to walk, even if someone were holding her hand. Dr O'Loughlin very much doubted Ebony would be able to sit unsupported because the muscles around her trunk, spine and chest would have been incapable of supporting her weight. He conceded that it was possible, if Ebony were conscious, for her to swallow soft food. However, it was Dr O'Loughlin's opinion that Ebony was probably comatose in the days leading up to her death, and that only her vital functions, such as heartbeat and respiration, would have been active in the 24 hours before her death. Dr Dimitra Tzioumi, a specialist paediatrician at Sydney Children's Hospital in Randwick who saw Ebony in 2002, gave evidence that it ""was not possible medically"" that Ebony appeared well on the Friday evening.

31Finally, BW said in his evidence that the applicant had said to him, shortly after the discovery of Ebony's dead body, ""We have to get rid of the body"". The applicant denied having said this.

32In the summing-up, the trial judge gave directions with respect to the state of mind that the jury would have to be satisfied of in order to find BW and the applicant guilty of murder. His Honour correctly identified for the jury that a prerequisite to a murder conviction was that each of the accused had either an intention to kill the deceased or was recklessly indifferent to human life, in that they foresaw that Ebony's death was a probable consequence of their acts or failure to act but nevertheless persisted in their course of conduct. His Honour emphasised that each of the accused denied having had the relevant state of mind at the relevant time.

33The following extract of the summing-up provides a useful summary of the argument mounted by the applicant about her state of mind:

""So Mr Stewart [counsel for the applicant] then isolated and identified for you the single issue in the trial of his client, whether the Crown was able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that [SW] realised that by her omission to act [Ebony] would probably die and he then presented a number of arguments to you as to why you would not find that this had been proved to the required standard, that is beyond reasonable doubt. He referred to the Crown's argument 'Who in their right mind would feed a child with vomiting and diarrhoea, Weetbix and muesli?' Mr Stewart said this points to the issue of the state of mind of [SW] in the days leading up to [Ebony's] death. If she was trying to get rid of her, why would she bother to feed her such things? He said that a person might if they are negligent. Rather than an attempt to get rid of the child, Mr Stewart submitted that it was just an inappropriate response.

He submitted that [SW] had issues and problems. She found it very difficult to cope with the responsibility of care of her children. Reference was made to [Ebony] being very thin at the time of the move from Matraville and her experience in vomiting and diarrhoea at Hawks Nest. Mr Stewart then referred you to the history of problems that [Ebony] had experienced throughout her life. He submitted that there was a history of [SW] failing to cope and falling down in the care of her daughter. He also referred to what he submitted was a coincidence of the observations of [SW] failing to cope and falling down in the care of her daughter. He also referred to what he submitted was a coincidence of the observations of [SW] herself at the same time as doctors were noticing problems with [Ebony], for example, when Dr Ktenas saw [Ebony] at the age of 12 months he also noted that [SW] looked thin.

Mr Stewart also referred to the evidence of the police officer in charge of the case and of the handyman who both remarked about the difference in appearance of [SW] between when they saw her in 2007 and when they saw her in the courtroom. They both said in effect that she looked healthier now, notwithstanding, Mr Stewart said, she was in the dock under the stress of being on trial for murder.

Mr Stewart said there was no single explanation for why his client did not see the dire condition that he child was in. He said the explanation lay in a combination of factors. He referred to her drug use, her depression, the removal of [BW], the chronic pain that [SW] was in, the relative social isolation in which she was living, the fact that she had not seen her mother for over a decade and her being in a relationship with a man who was addicted to Valium.

Mr Stewart submitted that you should have regard to all of the those things that were going on in her life and their cumulative effect which produced a situation in which she could not cope well and could not fully appreciate what was happening with [Ebony].""

34The trial judge gave the following directions in respect of the applicant's testimony about her state of mind:

""I think it is appropriate that I make a comment to you about that submission, ladies and gentlemen. You should bear in mind that whilst you had evidence from a number of witnesses about these difficulties that [SW] was experiencing, there is no evidence from anyone other than [SW] herself that these difficulties had an effect upon her ability to appreciate what was occurring with [Ebony], that her physical condition was being adversely affected by inadequate nutrition and that her decline reached a stage where she was badly in need of nourishment and/or medical attention. None of the doctors or any of the other witnesses gave evidence that any of these difficulties, either on their own or in combination, would have a bearing upon [SW's] capacity to understand the physical condition of the child. Mr Stewart's submission was that these matters were relevant to his client's state of mind at the time. They are matters that you may take into account.

However, as I said, you should bear in mind that the evidence that her state of mind was such that she did not see the decline of [Ebony] came from [SW] alone.""

Alleged lies and conduct capable of being construed as evidence of consciousness of guilt

35It is necessary to identify the alleged lies and conduct that form the basis of Grounds 1(a) and 1(c) of the appeal.

36The first alleged lie of which the applicant complains was central to the Crown case. The applicant told the ambulance officers who attended the scene that she did not appreciate the seriousness of Ebony's condition. She repeated that claim to the police officers who executed the search warrant at the Hawks Nest property, as well as in the evidence she gave at trial. The Crown argued that it beggared belief that the applicant did not realise that Ebony's condition was rapidly deteriorating and that her death was imminent. 

37The second alleged lie of which the applicant complains arose from the account BW and the applicant had given about Ebony's condition on the night before she died. As explained above, the Crown relied on the evidence of Dr O'Loughlin to argue that this account could not be true.

38BW told the police in his interview of 5 November 2007 that, on the evening of 2 November 2007, he saw Ebony in the lounge room sitting up in front of the television. The Crown argued that this was a lie going to consciousness of guilt, as the medical evidence indicated that Ebony would have been physically incapable of having done so. BW conceded at trial that what he told the police was a lie. He said that he was merely repeating what the applicant had told him, that he had no personal knowledge about the matter, and that he had lied in order to protect his wife. In summing up, the trial judge gave an ""Edwards direction"" (Edwards v The Queen [1993] HCA 63; (1993) 178 CLR 193) about the use to which the jury could put the lie:

""But I need to give you a legal direction about that particular lie that the Crown says that [BW] told the police and [BW] concedes he told the police. Before you can take a lie into account as evidence of the guilt of the accused, you must be satisfied that it was, in fact, not only a lie but also a deliberate lie. If you are not so satisfied that it was a deliberate lie, well then you cannot use it for this purpose, that is, as evidence of guilt of the accused. If you are, however, satisfied that it was a deliberate lie, then you must also be satisfied that it was a lie that first, relates to an issue that is material or relevant to the offence charged and second, it reveals a knowledge of the offence or some aspect of it and third, that it was told because the accused knew the truth of the matter about which he lied would implicate him in the offence or, to put it another way, because of a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth. I emphasise that you must be satisfied that what was in his mind was guilt of the offence charged and not some other crime.""

39Consistently with BW's evidence, the applicant said that Ebony was sitting up in the lounge room, that she fed Ebony, and that she helped Ebony walk to her bedroom (see above at [28]-[29]).

40The third alleged lie of which the applicant complains related to a soiled nappy containing urine and hard stools which was found by police in a bin at the Hawks Nest home. The applicant said it was the nappy Ebony had been wearing on the night of 2 November 2007, and that she had fitted Ebony with a fresh nappy before putting the child to bed that night. The Crown disputed this account. It was put to the applicant in cross-examination that the hard stools in the nappy were inconsistent with Ebony having eaten very little and having suffered from diarrhoea shortly before her death. The Crown ultimately suggested in closing that the nappy in question had been worn by Ebony for some time before her death. The suggestion was that the applicant had lied because the truth would have implicated her in the offence by disclosing a failure to tend to the child's needs.

41The fourth alleged lie related to the applicant's claim that in the two weeks leading up to Ebony's death she expressed to BW concerns about Ebony's wellbeing (see above at [27]).

42The fifth alleged lie was the applicant's denial that she suggested to BW that they get rid of Ebony's body (see above at [31]).

43In relation to the conduct referred to in Ground 1(c), the applicant complains that his Honour did not give any directions about the fact that Ebony did not appear in family photographs from mid-July 2006 onwards. At trial, the applicant said that Ebony did not figure in the photos because she made a nuisance of herself whenever they were being taken. The Crown suggested that the applicant had taken care not to include Ebony in the photographs because she was aware of Ebony's pitiful state. For the reasons I give below, this conduct could not be attributed to the applicant's consciousness of guilt.

44Also relevant to Ground 1(c) are the allegations that the applicant feigned a suicide attempt after Ebony's death in order to disguise her true state of mind; that the applicant photographed a bull ant in Ebony's room in order to support her false story that bull ants were coming out of the deceased child's nose and mouth; and that the applicant and BW had fled to the South Coast soon after Ebony's death in order to evade the police.

45The trial judge instructed the jury as to the relevance, or lack thereof, of the applicant's alleged lies in view of her concession that she was guilty of manslaughter:

""Now, given that [SW] concedes that she is guilty of manslaughter, any lie that you find that she told you is incapable of assisting you in determining whether she is guilty of murder. It really has no value in that task. Any lies that you are satisfied she told, either to the police or in her evidence here and any lies in addition to the one I have mentioned that you are satisfied [BW] told, either to the police or in his evidence here, are only relevant to your assessment of their credibility. That is, your assessment of whether you can believe what they have said.""

46The trial judge did not give any such direction in relation to the use of the applicant's post-offence conduct as a basis for choosing between verdicts of murder and manslaughter. The direction was limited in its terms to the alleged lies.

Ground 1(a): His Honour failed to appropriately direct the jury as to how they could use the evidence of the accused alleged lies (sic). 

Ground 1(c) His Honour failed to direct the jury as to how they could use the evidence of the conduct capable of being construed as evidencing consciousness of guilt.

Ground 1(d) His Honour failed to direct the jury with respect to the alleged lies told to her husband. 

47It is appropriate to deal with these grounds together, as they each invoke the concept of consciousness of guilt reasoning. Counsel below made no relevant objection to the directions of the trial judge that are now complained of in this appeal. Accordingly, the applicant requires leave to appeal for these grounds, pursuant to Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules.

48The crux of the applicant's submissions on these grounds is as follows. The sole issue in the trial was the applicant's mental state in the period leading up to Ebony's death, and in particular whether the applicant foresaw the probability of Ebony's death. This was because there was no dispute that the applicant was at least guilty of manslaughter. The applicant gave evidence about her mental state. Whether the jury accepted that evidence necessarily rested upon their view of the applicant's credibility. Accordingly, when the trial judge told the jury in the portion of the summing-up extracted at [45] that the only purpose for which they could use the alleged lies was in evaluating the applicant's credibility, the jury might have mistakenly understood that direction to mean that if they took an adverse view of the applicant's credibility on account of the lies, they could thereby conclude that she was guilty of murder. The applicant's complaint is that the jury might have reasoned, quite illogically, that she had the mental state for murder because they did not believe her when she said she did not. The applicant submitted that for the jury so to reason would have amounted to a reversal of the onus of proof.

49What the trial judge was attempting to convey by his direction was that there was no logical process of reasoning by which the jury could find that the lies proved that the applicant was guilty of murder rather than manslaughter. The lies, if proved, could demonstrate the applicant's acknowledgement that she had committed a crime (either the murder or manslaughter of Ebony). But they could not rationally speak to whether she committed that crime with the mental state for murder. The lies were of no probative value on that question. However, while the lies could not be used for this purpose, the jury could consider them in deciding what weight to give the applicant's evidence more generally.

50The applicant also submitted that the manner in which the Crown presented its case gave rise to a significant risk of misunderstanding on the part of the jury as to how they could use the applicant's alleged lies and other post-offence conduct. According to the applicant, that risk made it necessary for his Honour to give an Edwards-type direction in relation to the applicant, despite the Crown's disavowal of any reliance upon consciousness of guilt reasoning in relation to her. The applicant relied on what was said by Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ in Zoneff v The Queen [2000] HCA 28; (2000) 200 CLR 234 at [16]-[17]:

""There may be cases in which the risk of misunderstanding on the part of a jury as to the use to which they may put lies might be such that a judge should give an Edwards-type direction notwithstanding that the prosecutor has not put that a lie has been told out of consciousness of guilt. As a general rule, however, an Edwards-type direction should only be given if the prosecution contends that a lie is evidence of guilt, in the sense that it was told because, in the language of Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ in Edwards, 'the accused knew that the truth ... would implicate him in [the commission of] the offence' and if, in fact, the lie in question is capable of bearing that character. (The words in italics are ours and, for the sake of clarity, should be included in the statement of principle.)

Moreover, if there is a risk of confusion or doubt as to the way in which the prosecution puts its case, the trial judge should inquire of the prosecution whether it contends that lies may constitute evidence of consciousness of guilt and, if so, he or she should require identification of the lie or lies in issue and the basis on which they are said to be capable of implicating the accused in the commission of the offence charged.""

51Counsel for the applicant argued that the Zoneff direction was necessary because of the structure and content of the trial judge's summing-up, together with the Crown's many suggestions that the applicant had lied about various matters. His Honour highlighted for the jury at the outset that the alleged lies told by the applicant could be used only to assess her credibility. However, the applicant's credibility was the central fact in issue, in that she denied being aware of Ebony's deterioration in the period before the child's death. The applicant accordingly argued that when the trial judge proceeded to summarise the Crown case in detail, including the suggestions therein that the applicant had lied about various matters, the jury might have been led to conclude that the applicant was guilty of murder solely because she could not be believed when she denied having foreseen Ebony's probable death. The applicant cited specific portions of the summing-up to support this submission. I have set out some of the relevant extracts below, with emphasis on the particular passages that are said to have undermined the direction:

""After referring to that evidence, Mr Crown submitted that you would reject the claim by [SW] that she just did not see the condition of her child being as bad as it was. He referred to the evidence she gave at the end of her cross-examination in which she agreed that anyone who saw the child get into that condition in the last week or weeks of her life would realise that, without medical attention or adequate nourishment, it was a certainty the child would die.

...

Given the early history of poor weight gain for [Ebony] and the Department of Community Services taking away baby [BW] for having lost weight, the Crown Prosecutor submitted that you would expect that [SW] would be hyper vigilant to notice any changes in the condition of her child, particularly as to her weight. He referred again to Dr Tzioumi who said that since [Ebony] weighed 20 kilograms in early 2006 she would have put on another 6 kilograms by November 2007 but the evidence was that she lost more than half of her weight. Mr Crown suggested the reason [SW] was saying she did not notice the decline of her child was because that if she did say that she did not notice it, then that would in effect be the end of the matter.

...

Generally as to [BW's] police interview and what he said to various ambulance and police officers who came to the house on the day of [Ebony] death, [BW] claims that the things said about [Ebony] were simply things he was repeating from what [SW] had told him. Mr Crown submitted that if that were the case they would have had to have been relayed to him by [SW] at some time between her telling him that [Ebony] had died and him making the 000 call. He submitted that was unlikely and the more likely it was the case of the two accused having got their heads together at an earlier time.

...

In relation to the nappy found by police in the rubbish, Mr Crown submitted that you would not accept that it had been worn by [Ebony] on and only on the night of her death, given the extremely minimal intake of food and liquid she had experienced for some weeks. He gave you a number of reasons for you to conclude that the claim by [SW] that she had put this on as a fresh nappy on the Friday night was, he said, 'ridiculous'.""

52Grounds 1(c) and 1(d) raise more specific complaints about the directions. 

53Under Ground 1(c), the applicant submitted that even if there were no risk that the jury misunderstood his Honour's direction about the lies, the trial judge's direction was limited only to the spoken lies and did not extend to evidence of conduct (including statements other than lies)which, on one view, might have suggested the applicant's consciousness of guilt for murder: see DJF v R [2011] NSWCCA 6 at [44] (Adams J). In the latter category was the allegation that the applicant had said to BW, ""we need to get rid of the body"", as well as the allegations that the applicant had feigned a suicide attempt and had taken a photo of a bull ant in Ebony's room in order to shore up her claim that she found Ebony with bull ants pouring out of her nose and mouth. The applicant submitted that, as with the alleged lies, there was no logical process of reasoning by which the jury could find that conduct of this kind proved that the applicant was guilty of murder rather than manslaughter. The applicant submitted that his Honour's failure to address the use that could be made of the conduct gave rise to a miscarriage of justice, as the jury may well have used the conduct to reason that the applicant had the mental state for murder.

54Under Ground 1(d), the applicant took issue with the lack of directions about the prosecutor's suggestion that the applicant and BW had ""put their heads together"" to come up with a false story about their observations of Ebony on the Friday night. The applicant complained that the trial judge made no reference to BW's evidence that the applicant had lied to him about her observations of Ebony on the Friday night. The jury apparently accepted BW's explanation that he had presented the applicant's account to the police as his own in order to protect his wife. The applicant said that it was misleading in the circumstances for his Honour not to give an Edwards-type direction in relation to the suggested collusion between the applicant and BW. According to the applicant, such a direction was necessary in order to focus the jury's mind on the possibility that the applicant might have lied to BW not out of consciousness of guilt, but out of a concern that DOCS would take custody of her children if it were discovered that Ebony had died under the applicant's care.

55The Crown argued on the appeal that the jury must have found the applicant guilty of murder on the basis of evidence other than her testimony, such as inferences drawn from the post-mortem photographs of Ebony and expert evidence regarding Ebony's deteriorating physical condition in the lead-up to her death.

56The Crown submitted that an Edwards-type direction should not have been given, as the giving of the direction would have misleadingly suggested to the jury that consciousness of guilt reasoning was available in relation the applicant. The Crown submitted that there was never any suggestion at trial, or in the trial judge's summing-up, that the alleged lies or post-offence conduct could be used to discriminate between verdicts of murder or manslaughter. The Crown placed particular reliance on his Honour's direction to the jury that ""any lie that you find that she [the applicant] told you is incapable of assisting you in determining whether she is guilty of murder. It really has no value in that task."" The Crown said that in those circumstances, the effect of an Edwards-type direction would have been to underscore a process of reasoning that was not available to the jury. The Crown argued that trial counsel for the applicant had made a sound tactical decision in not seeking further directions.

57The Crown then submitted that, even if an Edwards-type direction were warranted in the circumstances, the trial judge's directions achieved much the same result, as their effect was to prohibit the jury from using any of the alleged lies as the basis for a conclusion that the applicant had the mental state for murder. 

58The Crown conceded that the trial judge did not specifically direct the jury that they could not differentiate between verdicts of murder and manslaughter on the basis of the applicant's post-offence conduct. However, the Crown submitted that this was of no moment. This was because the jury would have inferred, from the direction his Honour had given about the spoken lies, that the post-offence conduct similarly did not cast any light upon the applicant's mental state at the time of the offence.

59As to Ground 1(d), the Crown submitted that the suggestion of collusion between the applicant and BW did not result in a miscarriage of justice. The Crown argued that the suggestion of collusion needed to be seen in the light of its context. At the time the Crown made that suggestion, the applicant had not yet conceded that she was guilty of manslaughter. Accordingly, the fact of collusion was probative of whether she was guilty in a general sense, although it could not properly be used to discriminate between verdicts of murder and manslaughter. However, the alleged collusion ceased to be relevant to the applicant's case once she accepted responsibility for manslaughter. So much was accepted by the prosecutor. The trial judge made plain to the jury that the applicant's lies could not be used to discriminate between verdicts of murder and manslaughter. The Crown argued that even if this direction did not by its terms encompass the collusive conduct, the jury would have surmised that the direction applied equally to such conduct because of the interrelationship between the alleged collusion and the resulting lies about Ebony's behaviour on the Friday night.

60Finally, the Crown submitted that even if the applicant had demonstrated some error that warranted a grant of leave under Rule 4, the Court ought to dismiss the appeal. The Crown argued that no substantial miscarriage of justice had occurred, as the trial judge had expressly precluded the jury from using any of the applicant's alleged lies to discriminate between verdicts of murder and manslaughter. The Crown argued that this direction extended, at least by implication, to the applicant's post-offence conduct and alleged collusion.

Conclusion on Grounds 1(a), 1(c) and 1(d)

61It is difficult to accept the proposition that the trial judge's summing-up invited the jury to invert the onus of proof. The jury would have reached a conclusion as to the applicant's mental state from the circumstances as a whole, not just the applicant's evidence. They had before them Dr O'Loughlin's evidence to the effect that Ebony's life-threatening condition in the period before her death would have been obvious to anyone who saw her. They also had before them the autopsy photos, which showed what Ebony would have looked like shortly before her death. On the basis of this evidence alone, it was open to the jury to find beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant had foreseen that Ebony's death was a probable consequence of her continuing failure to provide the child with sufficient nourishment and care. It would be unreal to suggest that the jury's rejection of the applicant's evidence was the sole foundation for the finding of guilt. The jury had before them objective evidence that was rationally capable of informing their view of the applicant's mental state at the relevant time.

62There is no merit in the applicant's complaint that his Honour should have told the jury that they could not use the applicant's post-offence conduct or her incriminating statement about burying the body as a basis for distinguishing between verdicts of murder and manslaughter. If there were any real danger that the jury would misuse the statement or the post-offence conduct in its reasoning process, counsel absorbed in the atmosphere of the trial could be expected to have made an application for more specific directions about these aspects of the evidence: R v Tripodina (1988) 35 A Crim R 183 at 191 (Yeldham J). In any case, it is by no means obvious that the jury would have considered this process of reasoning logical unless specifically told otherwise by the trial judge. A moment's reflection would reveal that an attempt by the applicant to conceal Ebony's body could not in any way prove that she was recklessly indifferent to Ebony's life, or that she intended to kill the child, in the days, weeks and months leading up the death. No specific direction to this effect was required.

63I turn now to the suggestion that the applicant deliberately left Ebony out of family photographs from mid-July 2006 onwards because she was aware of the child's pitiful condition. To my mind, this was properly left to the jury as a fact which, if proved, was rationally capable of satisfying the jury that the applicant had the mental state for murder. The deliberate exclusion of Ebony from the photographs could be taken to suggest that the applicant was aware of the child's parlous state for a considerable period of time before her death. The applicant's awareness of Ebony's condition might have implied some realisation on her part that Ebony's death was probable if she did not tend to the child's needs. Accordingly, his Honour was not required to tell the jury that the applicant's deliberate exclusion of Ebony from the photographs, if proved, could not be used to distinguish between verdicts of murder and manslaughter. To the contrary, the fact could logically be used for that purpose.

64Nor am I persuaded that his Honour erred in failing to give a Zoneff or Edwards-typedirection in relation to the applicant's alleged lies. His Honour forbade the jury from using the lies as a basis for distinguishing between verdicts of murder and manslaughter. There was therefore no risk of misunderstanding on the part of the jury about the significance of the alleged lies, this being the necessary trigger for a Zoneff direction. The lies were taken out of play as evidence that might assist in discriminating between verdicts of murder and manslaughter. 

65There is no reason to think that the trial judge's summation of the Crown case would have led the jury to forget or second-guess his Honour's direction about the lies. The direction forbidding use of the lies for the purpose of finding the applicant guilty of murder was emphatic in its terms. His Honour was not obliged to repeat it, even when he traversed the Crown case in the summing-up. Moreover, trial counsel did not seek any redirection. This provides added reason to think that the atmosphere of the trial was such that his Honour's traversal of the Crown case did not leave the jury with the impression that the lies could be used to discriminate between verdicts of murder and manslaughter. 

66The applicant has failed to show either an arguable case that his Honour erred in law, or that her conviction is a miscarriage of justice: Papakosmas v The Queen [1999] HCA 37; (1999) 196 CLR 297 at [72] (McHugh J). Accordingly, Rule 4 applies in relation to Grounds 1(a), 1(c) and 1(d) and I would refuse leave to raise these grounds.

Ground 1(b) His Honour erred in his comment as to the lack of alleged corroboration (and therefore her lack of credibility) as to the applicant's claimed state of mind during the time of the child's deteriorating health leading up to her death. 

67The trial judge's comment about the lack of independent evidence to support the applicant's claimed state of mind in the lead-up to Ebony's death is set out at [34] of this judgment.

68The applicant's submissions on this ground of appeal are as follows. The applicant's state of mind in the period leading up to Ebony's death was the critical fact in issue. Accordingly, for the trial judge to lay emphasis on the lack of corroboration was, in effect, to cast the onus of proof upon her rather than the Crown. The applicant said that the trial judge's observation would have prompted the jury to ask, ""Has she demonstrated that she should be believed?""

69The Crown submitted that the trial judge's comment on the issue of corroboration was unobjectionable in the context of the trial. The Crown said that although various witnesses had given evidence that the applicant was experiencing personal difficulties in the period leading up to Ebony's death, none of these witnesses went so far as to suggest that those difficulties would have impaired the applicant's ability to notice a marked deterioration in Ebony's condition. Moreover, Professor Starmer had conceded in cross-examination that neither the combination nor quantity of the drugs that the applicant claimed to have taken would have diminished her ability to notice deterioration in Ebony's physical state. The Crown said that the observation as to corroboration was appropriate because, without it, the jury might have uncritically equated the applicant's difficult life circumstances and drug intake with a diminution in her ability to perceive obvious changes in Ebony's physical condition.

Conclusion on Ground 1(b)

70In my view, the applicant's submissions on this ground ignore the entirety of the evidence led at trial. From first to last, the onus remained on the Crown to prove the elements of the offence beyond reasonable doubt. The trial judge gave the usual directions to this effect. However, the photographs of Ebony and the evidence of Drs Nadesan and O'Loughlin amounted to powerful evidence contradicting the applicant's assertions. The jury were entitled to ask themselves whether they should accept the applicant's evidence about her claimed state of mind because the independent evidence regarding Ebony's condition provided a firm basis on which to infer that the applicant must have appreciated Ebony's dire condition shortly before her death.

71Against this background, it was not improper for the trial judge to mention the lack of corroboration. I agree with the Crown submission that the trial judge's comment about the want of corroboration was not inappropriate in light of the other evidence led at trial. That trial counsel raised no objection at the time also inclines me to the view that his Honour's comment did not give rise to a miscarriage of justice, bearing in mind the atmosphere of the trial.

72For these reasons, I am of the view that the applicant should be refused leave to raise this ground of appeal.

Ground 2: His Honour failed to direct the jury that before they could convict the appellant upon (sic) murder they had to be satisfied the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was not so intoxicated as a result of prescribed drugs she was taking alone and/or in combination with other matters she said were affecting her state of mind as to be able to form the specific intent necessary for murder. In other words, to thereby realise that her child was probably going to die. 

73The applicant said that the significance of the evidence regarding the effect of the prescription drugs on her mental state was such that his Honour should have given a specific direction about the relevance of drug-induced intoxication, despite the omission by trial counsel to ask for any redirection on this point. Section 428C(1) of the Crimes Act relevantly provides: ""Evidence that a person was intoxicated (whether by reason of self-induced intoxication or otherwise) at the time of the relevant conduct may be taken into account in determining whether the person had the intention to cause the specific result necessary for an offence of specific intent"". Section 428C(1) applies to a charge of murder by reckless indifference: R v Grant [2002] NSWCCA 243 at [97]-[98] (Wood CJ at CL, Spigelman CJ and Kirby J agreeing).

74The applicant submitted that a direction on drug-induced intoxication was necessary because her use of prescription and other drugs was one of the factors upon which she relied to explain her failure to perceive changes in Ebony's physical state. The applicant relied upon the following enunciation of principle by Gibbs J in Viro v The Queen [1978] HCA 9; (1978) 141 CLR 88 at [112], quoted with approval by this Court in Bellchambers v R [2008] NSWCCA 235 at [33]:

""In a case where there is evidence fit to be considered by a jury that the accused was intoxicated as a result of the consumption of drink or drugs, it is not enough to tell the jury that the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had in fact formed the requisite special intent. They should also be told that the fact that the accused was intoxicated, whether by drink or drugs or by a combination of both, may be regarded for the purpose of ascertaining whether the special intent in fact existed. It should be explained that evidence that the accused was intoxicated will not in itself entitle him to an acquittal, because a person when intoxicated may form the necessary intent, and one who has formed the intent does not escape responsibility because his intoxication has diminished his power to resist the temptation to carry it out. However, the jury should be told that if, because of the evidence as to the effect of the intoxication or otherwise, they are not satisfied that the accused did in fact have the necessary intent, they must acquit of the crime which involves that intent.""

75The Crown accepted that even where the defence does not seek directions on intoxication, a trial judge must give such directions if the evidence raises the reasonable possibility that intoxication had an effect on the accused's mental state at the relevant time: R v Sullivan [2011] NSWCCA 270 at [35] (Blanch J, McClellan CJ at CL and Hislop J agreeing). 

76However, the Crown argued on the appeal that the evidence regarding intoxication did not justify a specific direction. To this end, the Crown pointed to various deficiencies in the evidence regarding intoxication. One such deficiency was the long period of time (weeks or months) over which the applicant failed to attend to Ebony's needs. It would have been difficult to argue that intoxication was an operative factor over the entire period in which the applicant might have formed the specific intent for murder. Another deficiency in the evidence was the concession by Professor Starmer that a person who took the drugs in the quantities reported by the applicant would have developed a tolerance to their effects. There was also evidence indicating that the applicant was capable of completing complex tasks in the period leading up to Ebony's death.

77The Crown also observed that the applicant's case was never put to the jury on the basis of intoxication alone, perhaps because of the weaknesses in the evidence regarding intoxication. Rather, the case for the applicant was that a multiplicity of factors, including her use of drugs, had culminated in her inability to cope and resultant failure to notice the fatal deterioration of her child.

78Finally, the Crown submitted that the absence of any application by trial counsel for redirection on the issue of intoxication could be explained by sound tactical considerations. The Crown said that it was more advantageous to the applicant's case to argue that the drugs, in combination with other factors, had impaired her ability to perceive Ebony's deterioration. This was because the evidence did not suggest that intoxication was a discrete factor that operated upon the applicant's mental state.

Conclusion on Ground 2

79To my mind, the implications of the evidence regarding intoxication were fairly brought to the jury's attention by the trial judge's summation of the defence case. His Honour cogently explained the defence case to the jury. According to that case, it was a reasonable possibility that a combination of factors had led to the applicant's failure to perceive Ebony's deterioration in the relevant period. Drug-induced intoxication was one of these factors, but the defence never relied upon it in isolation from the others.

80The Crown is correct to argue that the applicant's defence to murder was never one of drug-induced intoxication as such. It would have been artificial, and perhaps even misleading, for the trial judge to give directions about drug-induced intoxication as a discrete factor that was capable of operating upon her mental state. Having regard to the evidence of Professor Starmer, the evidence suggested, at its highest, that the intake of drugs in combination with other life stressors might have affected the applicant's mental state in some way. But the drugs could not be singled out as having, on their own, a sufficiently distortive effect on the applicant's perceptions. Neither Professor Starmer's evidence, nor that of any other witness, provided a foundation for that conclusion. 

81Even if the applicant's use of drugs provided a discrete basis for an argument that she was so intoxicated that there was a reasonable doubt about whether she had formed the mental state for murder, the jury would have needed to be satisfied that she was intoxicated to this degree for the whole of the period during which she failed to provide Ebony with the necessities of life. This is because the Crown needed only to prove that the applicant had the mental state for murder at some point during that period. Even a momentary realisation by the applicant that Ebony's death was probable would have been enough to establish the mental state for murder. Seen in this light, the evidence did not raise a reasonable possibility that drug-induced intoxication alone had prevented the applicant from forming the mental state for murder.

82All of these factors explain why his Honour was not asked to give, and did not give, any directions that isolated and dealt with drug-induced intoxication separately from the other factors on which the applicant relied to raise a reasonable doubt about whether she had the mental state for murder. The evidence did not raise the reasonable possibility that drug-induced intoxication had operated as a discrete influence on the applicant's mental state at the material times. I would therefore refuse leave to raise this ground of appeal.

Sentence Ground: In all the circumstances the sentence imposed was too severe.

83The applicant also seeks leave to raise one ground of appeal against sentence. It is necessary to summarise those parts of the remarks on sentence which are relevant to the appeal.

84The trial judge found that the jury had convicted the applicant of murder on the basis of her reckless indifference to Ebony's life: R v BW & SW (No 3) [2009] NSWSC 1043 at [187], [121]. His Honour found that the applicant had considered not just the probability, but the ""dead set certainty"", that Ebony was going to die. He was of the view that it would have been no worse if the applicant had actually formed an intention to kill Ebony: BW & SW (No 3) at [187]. His Honour's reasoning on this point was as follows:

""Murder by reckless indifference might generally be regarded as less serious than murder with an intention to kill but this is not necessarily so: R v Ainsworth (1994) 76 A Crim R 127 at 139. I have already indicated that in the circumstances of this case there is no real distinction between culpability for murder by either of these states of mind. There was evidence from Dr Nadesan that immediately prior to death Ebony's body would have appeared the same as depicted in the post mortem photographs. SW agreed with a proposition put to her by the Crown Prosecutor that a person seeing Ebony in that state would realise that it was not just a probability but a ""dead set certainty"" that she was going to die. She would have appeared in a similar state for quite some time before she died. To my mind, for a person to have done nothing in those circumstances is so morally reprehensible that it could be no more serious if the person actually intended to kill the child.""

85The trial judge found that the applicant's case fell within the ""worst case category"": BW & SW (No 3) at [188]. He was of the view that the applicant's criminal offending required the imposition of a life sentence in accordance with s 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999: BW & SW (No 3) at [191]. His Honour was mindful that a sentence of life imprisonment carries with it no possibility for consideration of release on parole: BW & SW (No 3) at [189]. However, because of the ""extreme gravity of the offence"", he was ""not satisfied that any of the subjective features, alone or in combination, are sufficient to displace the prima facie need for the maximum penalty"": BW & SW (No 3) at [191].

86Pre-trial evaluations of the applicant by Dr Olav Nielssen, a psychiatrist, and Ms Duffy, a psychologist, were relied upon at the sentencing hearing. Dr Nielssen assessed the applicant on the basis of her self-reported history. She told him that she was under the control of BW for many years, that she had lost the capacity to act on her own behalf, and that she had little say in the care of the children. She claimed that BW was ""unpredictably violent"" and had physically abused her on a number of occasions. She told Dr Nielssen that the Matraville home was in a squalid state because, no matter how much she cooked and cleaned, BW would quickly create more mess. The applicant also claimed that BW had forced her to participate in bondage and sadomasochistic sexual acts with paying clients in their home from 1992 to 2004. The applicant told Dr Nielssen about a number of health problems she had experienced throughout her life, including an eating disorder, asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic lower back pain, self-harming behaviour, and anxiety attacks. 

87Dr Nielssen concluded that ""it was not clear that [the applicant] met the accepted criteria for the diagnosis of any major psychiatric disorder"". He was willing to concede, however, that the applicant suffered from a ""personality disorder"" or ""a disabling level of pervasive and maladaptive personality traits"". Dr Nielssen wrote in his report:

""From the history elicited, it did seem that [the applicant] had developed the learned helplessness of women in abusive relationships. She reported being closely controlled with the threat of violence over many years to the extent that she became completely isolated and had no ready means to leave the relationship, especially as she had the care of three children with various disabilities. Hence it is possible that [the applicant] would be able to raise a defence arising from ""battered women's syndrome"", which is not a psychiatric diagnosis but a set of circumstances that is recognised in law to arise in women who are subjected to chronic physical abuse to the extent that they are deprived of initiative and a capacity for free will. The combination of her own physical problems and her lack of initiative may have affected her capacity to appreciate the state of her child's health or attending to her needs.""

88Dr Nielssen qualified that last sentence in his oral evidence. He said that although the applicant's capacity to appreciate Ebony's physical circumstances was not greatly affected, she had probably become used to the child's poor health.

89The applicant gave Ms Duffy an account of her life history which was largely consistent with the account she gave Dr Nielssen. Ms Duffy assessed the applicant on the basis of the self-reported history and a number of psychometric tests that she had the applicant undergo. Ms Duffy concluded:

""It is considered that [the applicant's] dissociation in response to her chronic trauma state arising from her abusive relationship may have blinded her literally (sic) to the plight of her emaciated daughter. Her perceptions may have been distorted to the extent that she believed that [Ebony] would 'come good' as she had done before. Thus it came as a real shock to [the applicant] that her daughter had starved to death literally in front of her eyes and that she had not realised it. Her multiple psychological problems including dissociation may have detached her sufficiently from reality that she did not recognise the extent of her daughter's starvation.

It is considered that [the applicant] has a number of severe psychological conditions although she is not mentally ill. She shows evidence of personality disorder and profound depression and anxiety as well as Post Traumatic Stress disorder. Her involvement in [a] psychologically damaging relationship has altered her perceptions and her perspective on a number of issues, and she will require considerable psychotherapy to come to terms with her role in the death of her daughter and recover from the abuse perpetrated on her over so many years.""

90The trial judge gave ""little weight"" to the evidence of Dr Nielssen and Ms Duffy: BW & SW (No 3) at [121]. After identifying a number of discrepancies between the accounts the applicant gave at trial and those she gave Dr Nielssen and Ms Duffy, as well as between their conclusions and the applicant's behaviour, his Honour said: ""There is a very real question as to whether SW should be believed in respect of the history she gave to Dr Nielssen and Ms Duffy"": BW & SW (No 3) at [118]. His Honour regarded the evidence of Dr Nielssen and Ms Duffy with scepticism for the added reason that they had evaluated the applicant before the trial, and therefore without the benefit of the jury's finding of guilt: BW & SW (No 3) at [118]. The trial judge was also concerned that Ms Duffy, a psychologist, had strayed into psychiatry in formulating her opinion: BW & SW (No 3) at [113]. The trial judge gave little or no weight to the applicant's account of her abusive relationship with BW, again because he had formed a negative view of her credit. 

91Nor did the trial judge accept the applicant's evidence about the level of her prescription drug use. He noted that the applicant had told Dr Nielssen that she did not abuse prescription drugs. In addition, although Professor Starmer gave evidence that heavy use of the drugs could impair a person's memory, Dr Nielssen reported that the applicant's ""command of detail and her capacity to retrieve information such as dates was remarkable"": BW & SW (No 3) at [120].

92His Honour accepted that Ebony did not figure in family photographs taken after July 2006 because of her increasingly pitiful condition: BW & SW (No 3) at [159].

93The applicant argued on the appeal that his Honour erred in finding that the applicant's case fell within the worst case category or otherwise warranted the imposition of a life sentence under s 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In the alternative, the applicant submitted that his Honour erred in not exercising his residual discretion under s 21(1) of the Act to impose a determinate sentence. 

94The applicant sought to establish error in a number of ways. She argued that comparable cases such as R v Folbigg [2003] NSWSC 859 and R v Pfitzner [2009] NSWSC 1267 demonstrated that a sentence of life imprisonment was excessive in her case. The applicant also took issue with the trial judge's rejection of the absence of planning as a mitigating factor, as well as the finding that, in the circumstances of the case, it would have been no more serious an offence if she had actually intended to kill Ebony. The applicant complained that his Honour erred in rejecting the evidence of Dr Nielssen and Ms Duffy, the applicant's evidence about her addiction to prescription medication, and the contention that the applicant was not an ""emotionally healthy person"" in the period leading up to Ebony's death. The applicant submitted that it was an error to dismiss such evidence out of hand because, absent an intention on the part of the applicant to kill Ebony, there must have been some psychological or psychiatric reason why the applicant failed to care for her child in the relevant period.

95The applicant also argued that the trial judge had attributed insufficient weight to the evidence of her general practitioner, Dr Garondy Novak, who noted in March 2007 that the applicant was in a lot of pain and having trouble coping. She was concerned that the applicant was taking greater than usual doses of prescription medication for her pain and panic attacks. Dr Novak formed the view that the applicant was depressed and referred her to a pain clinic for treatment and psychiatric assistance. The trial judge did not expressly mention Dr Novak's evidence in his judgment on sentence. He instead dealt with the issue of the applicant's depression in the following parenthetical way at [127]:

""A number of the medical witnesses called by the prosecution did, however, agree that SW appeared to be depressed. Invariably, however, when this was clarified in re-examination it was said that it was in the nature of her 'having the blues' rather than a matter of clinical depression. I am also not prepared to accept that her 'ability to cope' was impaired in any substantial way because of that aspect, either alone or in combination with any physical health issue.""

96The applicant challenged a number of factual findings made by the trial judge. The finding that the applicant deliberately excluded Ebony from the family photographs and kept her out of public view was said to be equivalent to a finding that the applicant intended to kill Ebony, whereas the trial judge sentenced her on the basis of reckless indifference. The applicant said that the finding could not in any event be sustained beyond reasonable doubt. This was because it implied that the applicant had deliberately exposed Ebony to chronic starvation from July 2006 through November 2007, though the evidence did not support an inference that the applicant had the mental state for murder over such a lengthy period. In support of this submission, the applicant pointed to the evidence of John Giavis, who was the last person other than the applicant and BW to see Ebony alive. Mr Giavis was a removalist engaged by the applicant and BW in August 2007 to move the family possessions from Matraville to Hawks Nest. He noted that Ebony was ""obviously quite skinny"" and looked about three years old. The applicant said it was significant that Mr Giavis' concerns about Ebony's wellbeing, if any, did not impel him to contact the authorities.

97The applicant also challenged the trial judge's finding that the applicant had failed to do all that she could to attend to Ebony's medical, developmental and educational needs for the duration of her life: BW & SW (No 3) at [151]. This finding was said to be inconsistent with evidence that Ebony was a ""chubby six-year-old"" in April 2006, was vaccinated, and had undergone a hernia operation that calmed her somewhat. The applicant was also critical of the seeming acceptance by his Honour that she had said to BW, ""we have to get rid of the body"": BW & SW (No 3) at [58], [68].

98The applicant submitted more generally on the issue of mens rea that his Honour should not have found that the applicant had the mental state for murder for more than a couple of days or weeks before Ebony's death: BW & SW (No 3) at [44], [156] and [159].

99The respondent maintained that the sentence was not erroneous. 

100The Crown said that the applicant's complaints about the trial judge's factual findings were unfounded. According to the Crown, his Honour did not find beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant had suggested to BW that they get rid of the body. To the contrary, the trial judge made note of the applicant's denial that she had done so, and omitted any reference to the disposal of the body in his formal findings of fact: BW & SW (No 3) at [58], [148]-[171]. 

101As to the finding that the applicant deliberately kept Ebony from public view and excluded her from family photographs, the Crown submitted that this finding was both open on the evidence and consistent with a mens rea standard of reckless indifference.

102The Crown said that Mr Giavis' evidence did not undermine the trial judge's finding that the applicant exposed Ebony to chronic starvation over many months. The Crown submitted that it was entirely speculative to conclude that Ebony must have been in none too parlous a state because Mr Giavis was not spurred to urgent action upon seeing the child. To this end, the respondent observed that there was no evidence led at trial or in the sentencing proceedings as to whether Mr Giavis took steps to notify the authorities, or his reasons for not doing so.

103On the issue of mens rea, the Crown submitted that it was open to the trial judge to find that the applicant must have realised that Ebony's death was probable for many months before her death. The Crown said that this finding was open on the evidence of Drs Nadesan and O'Loughlin and the post-mortem photographs.

104The Crown said that his Honour was justified in finding that the applicant exhibited such a high degree of reckless indifference to human life that her mental state could not meaningfully be distinguished from an intention to kill. It was said that the horrendousness of the offence and the length of time over which the applicant abdicated her basic parental responsibilities meant that the absence of planning could not be regarded as a mitigating factor. The Crown submitted that the applicant's attention to some of Ebony's needs prior to April 2006 was not inconsistent with a finding that the applicant had neglected the great majority of Ebony's needs throughout her entire life.

105As for evidence of Dr Nielssen and Ms Duffy, the Crown said that it was open for his Honour to give minimal weight to their views because of the unreliability of the applicant's self-reported history and the many inconsistencies between that history and the applicant's evidence at trial and on sentence. 

106The Crown said that it was not necessarily the case that the applicant's neglect of Ebony was attributable to some psychological or psychiatric deficit, and the trial judge was not required so to find. The Crown further argued that the finding that the applicant's use of prescription medication did not reduce her culpability was appropriate, as the evidence did not suggest that the drugs diminished her capacity to appreciate Ebony's condition or to take steps to redress it.

107Finally, the Crown sought to distinguish the applicant's case from comparable cases such as Folbigg and Pfitzner by pointing to differences between the applicant's subjective circumstances and the subjective features of those offenders.

Conclusion on Sentence Ground

108This Court is bound by the trial judge's findings of fact, unless they were not open on the evidence or an error in the sense referred to in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 can be shown: Hopley v R [2008] NSWCCA 105 at [28].

109I turn first to the submission that it was an error for his Honour to find that, in the circumstances of the offence, there was no appreciable difference in culpability between an intention to kill and reckless indifference to human life. The trial judge cited R v Ainsworth (1994) 76 A Crim R 127 as authority for the proposition that, ""whilst each case has to be considered on its own facts, there is no prima facie presumption that murder resulting from reckless indifference is less culpable than murder involving one of the other categories of malice referred to in the statutory definition of murder"" (at 139 (Gleeson CJ)). That statement of principle was accepted by Grove J in R v Holton [2004] NSWCCA 214, although his Honour was careful to draw out its implications. He accepted that there was no prima facie presumption that murder resulting from reckless indifference is less culpable than murder resulting from specific intention, but added that ""so to say inheres recognition that murder by reckless indifference is not necessarily as culpable as other forms. Each case must be considered on its own facts"" (at [59]).

110The trial judge had careful regard to the facts of the applicant's case. He made a considered judgment that the applicant's awareness of Ebony's life-threatening condition over a period of many months, coupled with her complete failure to take steps to cure it, was morally indistinguishable from an intention to kill. The moral judgment inherent in that finding might be contested. A reasonable person might think that it is always more morally reprehensible to set out upon a deliberate course to kill a child than to consider but disregard the probability, or even the certainty, that a child's death is imminent. But equally so, a reasonable person might think as the trial judge did. Bearing in mind the case law on this subject, which rejects any prima facie presumption that intentional murder is worse than murder by recklessness, it cannot be said that his Honour erred in collapsing the distinction between the two states of mind.

111The applicant challenged various findings of fact made by the trial judge. I have reviewed his Honour's reasons, the evidence at trial, and the evidence on sentence. I am satisfied that the findings of which the applicant complains were open on the evidence and were otherwise untainted by error in the sense referred to in House v The King. In particular, it was open to his Honour to accord minimal weight to the evidence of Dr Nielssen and Ms Duffy, for the reasons he gave. In addition, the post-mortem photographs and the evidence of Drs Nadesan and O'Loughlin provided ample support for his Honour's finding that the applicant was aware of Ebony's deterioration over a period of many months. His Honour's conclusion on this point was not undermined to any significant degree by the evidence of Mr Giavis. Finally, it was not an error for the trial judge to find that the applicant excluded Ebony from family photographs because she was aware of the child's pitiful condition. That finding was not irreconcilable with a mens rea standard of recklessness.

112There remains the question whether the sentence of life imprisonment was too severe. The trial judge considered himself bound by s 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to impose a life sentence on the applicant. The section provides: 

""A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence.""

113The assessment whether a case falls within the ""worst-case category"" at common law is not materially different from the assessment of culpability postulated by s 61(1): R v Merritt [2004] NSWCCA 19; (2004) 59 NSWLR 557 at [87] (Wood CJ at CL, Tobias JA and Hidden J agreeing); R v Harris [2000] NSWCCA 469; (2000) 50 NSWLR 409 at [87]-[88], [90]. Accordingly, it is appropriate to deal jointly with the applicant's submissions as to s 61(1) and the worst-case categorisation of the offence.

114The principles governing the review of life sentences imposed under s 61(1) were set out by Wood CJ at CL in Merritt at [60]-[61]. This Court is a court of error. Accordingly, the relevant question on the appeal is not whether this Court would have decided the question presented by s 61(1) differently. The relevant question is whether the sentence was wrong in law, in that it was not open to the sentencing judge to be satisfied that ""the combined effect of such of the four indicia as are applicable, could only be met by [a life sentence]"" (Merritt at [42], [54]).

115Much of the applicant's argument on sentence was directed to the trial judge's treatment of the evidence relating to the applicant's psychological dysfunction. An offender's mental state will operate to diminish the culpability of the offence only if it contributed to the commission of the offence: R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255 at [23]-[24]; R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [86]-[93]. The trial judge dismissed the applicant's psychological difficulties as a case of ""the blues"" which did not substantially affect her ""ability to cope"". He concluded that the applicant's depressed mood and general ill health were not causally connected to her failure to attend to Ebony's needs: BW & SW (No 3) at [127]. This Court is bound by that finding. Accepting it as accurate, the applicant's mental state at the time of the offence did not diminish her level of culpability for the purposes of the assessment required by s 61(1).

116A sentence of life imprisonment may not be required by s 61(1) if that sentence is outside the appropriate range of sentences for the type of crime under consideration. This Court cannot draw analogies between the applicant's case and those of other offenders who have committed similar crimes or have similar subjective features. However, the Court can refer to comparable cases in order to ascertain the parameters of the sentencing range. As Wood CJ at CL explained in Merritt at [62]:

""[W]hile it is appropriate for the Court to correct a sentence which is out of line with the commonly accepted pattern: Regina v Visconti [1982] 2 NSWLR 104, there is limited utility in drawing any direct comparison with a sentence imposed upon another offender, simply because the two offenders appear to have similar characteristics, or to have committed similar crimes. What must be considered is whether the sentence is within the appropriate range, and in that respect, other apparently similar cases merely form part of that range: Regina v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 and Regina v Salameh NSWCCA 9 June 1994.""

117His Honour concluded that reference to sentences imposed for comparable crimes is appropriate ""so long as they are understood to form part of an overall sentencing pattern"" (at [67]). It is with that caveat in mind that I have considered the cases set out below. I have borne in mind the diminished utility of those cases that predate the increase in the standard non-parole period for murder to 25 years. However, even those cases are of some value when the question is whether life imprisonment fits within the range of appropriate sentences. I have also taken due account of the fact that the sentences in some of these cases were imposed after a plea of guilty.


R v Lane [2011] NSWSC 289, where the offender was sentenced to an overall term of 18 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 13 years and five months, for the intentional murder of her newborn daughter following her discharge from hospital. The sentencing judge found that the offender did not suffer from any mental illness or disorder, although he did accept that the offence could in part be explained by her personality disorder.
R v Pfitzner [2009] NSWSC 1267, where the offender was sentenced to an overall term of 25 years and six months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 19 years and two months, for the murder of her two-year-old son, in circumstances where she shook the child for up to five minutes and threw him to the ground. The psychiatrist retained by the Crown concluded that the offender suffered from substance abuse disorder and severe borderline personality disorder, whereas another psychiatrist was of the opinion that she had a defence of substantial impairment open to her. On appeal, the sentence was found to be severe but not excessive: R v Pfitzner [2010] NSWCCA 314 at [46] (McClellan CJ at CL, Hislop and Price JJ agreeing).
R v PJS [2009] NSWSC 153, where the offender was sentenced, following conviction after trial, to an overall term of 26 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 20 years, for the murder of his three-year-old stepdaughter, in circumstances where he assaulted the child repeatedly for a period exceeding 20 minutes. A longer non-parole period would have been imposed but for the fact that PJS was the son of a magistrate and therefore had to serve his entire term in protective custody.
R v Jalaty [2006] NSWSC675, where the offender was sentenced, following conviction after trial, to an overall term of 20 years, with a non-parole period of 15 years, for the murder of her three-year-old daughter, in circumstances where she administered methadone to the child as part of a deliberate plan to kill her. There was no indication that the offender suffered from depression or any other mental disorder, although the sentencing judge accepted that the applicant's life had been a tumultuous one. The offence was assessed as lying within the middle of the range of objective seriousness.
R v Folbigg [2003] NSWSC 53, where the offender was sentenced, after trial, to an overall term of 40 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 30 years, for the murder of three of her children, the infliction of grievous bodily harm on one of those children, and the manslaughter of another, in circumstances where the offences took place over 10 years. There was evidence that the offender was a depressed and psychologically damaged person who was incapable of bonding effectively with her children. The sentence was reduced on appeal to a maximum of 30 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 25 years. The inappropriateness of a life sentence was acknowledged on the appeal: R v Folbigg [2005] NSWCCA 23. 
R v Fraser [2004] NSWSC 53, where the offender was sentenced after trial to an overall term of 32 years, with a non-parole period of 27 years, for the premeditated murder of his three children, aged seven, five and four years, in circumstances where the offender was fearful that he would lose the children as a result of his wife having formed a new relationship. The offender had a longstanding history of psychiatric disturbances and was in a disordered mental state at the time of the killings. On appeal, the sentence was held not to be manifestly excessive. However, the Court observed that the offender's motivation to punish the other parent was a feature of the case which exacerbated his culpability: R v Fraser [2005] NSWCCA 77 at [41]-[42] (Grove J).
R v Merritt [2002] NSWSC 1159, where the offender was sentenced, after a plea of guilty, to life imprisonment for the murder of his three children, aged six, 11 months and 11 weeks, in circumstances where he acted spontaneously and was in a state of depression, or at least in a significantly depressed mood. The sentence was reduced on appeal to an overall sentence of 34 years, with a non-parole period of 24 years: R v Merritt [2004] NSWCCA 19.
R v Cikos [2001] NSWSC 35, where the offender was sentenced, after a plea of guilty, to 21 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 15 years and 6 months, for the murder of his de facto partner and two sons, aged four years and 18 months, in circumstances where he had suffered months of physical and verbal abuse by his partner. The forensic psychiatrist concluded that the offender did not suffer from any cognitive defect or serious mental disorder.
R v Cheatham [2001] NSWSC 580, where the offender received an overall term of imprisonment of 24 years, with a non-parole period of 16 years, for the murder of his wife and three-year-old daughter, and for wounding his baby daughter with intent to murder, at a time when he was depressed and suffering from delusions. On appeal, a majority of this Court reduced the sentence to 22 years overall, with a non-parole period of 14 years, on the basis that the sentencing judge had given insufficient weight to the fact that the sentence was to be served in protective custody: R v Cheatham [2002] NSWCCA 360.
R v Velevski (Unreported, NSWSC, Dunford J, 26 September 1997), where the offender was sentenced after trial to an overall term of 25 years, with a non-parole period of 19 years, for the murder of his wife, six-year-old daughter and three-month-old twins, in circumstances that involved a high degree of planning.
R v Park (Unreported, NSWSC, Sperling J, 3 August 2000), where the offender was sentenced, following conviction after trial, to a head sentence of 26 years with a non-parole period of 19 years and six months, for the murder of his wife and two children, aged three and two, in circumstances where the offender was in a highly charged emotional state, disposed of the bodies, and attempted to escape detection. The sentence was undisturbed on the Crown appeal against sentence, although it was described as ""lenient"": R v Park [2003] NSWCCA 142 at [19] (James J).
R v Hughes and Ashfield (Unreported, NSWSC, Badgery-Parker J, 16 December 1994), where the two co-accused were each sentenced, following pleas of guilty, to a maximum term of 21 years penal servitude, with a minimum term of 16 years, for the murder of their six-year-old son, whom they subjected to ""hideous brutality"". The crime was found to fall marginally short of the worst category of cases.
R v Gorman and Armstrong (Unreported, NSWSC, Badgery-Parker J, 25 August 1995), where the step-father was sentenced, following conviction after trial, to a head sentence of 17 years with a non-parole period of 13 years, for the murder of his step-daughter. It was found that there was no element of premeditation or planning, and that the offence in a general way was attributable to the prisoner's immaturity and inability to cope with domestic situations. The sentence corresponded with a crime at the higher end of the scale of objective seriousness.

118The established range does not fix the boundaries within which judges must or even ought to sentence: Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [54]. As the plurality said in Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at [59], ""recording what sentences have been imposed in other cases is useful if, but only if, it is accompanied by an articulation of what are to be seen as the unifying principles which those disparate sentences may reveal"". Accordingly, it is necessary to endeavour to identify the ""unifying principles"", if any, which can be derived from the abovementioned sentences for child murders.

119The cases that received the most severe sentences were marked by a calculated plan on the part of the offender to kill his or her child or children, or the unpremeditated but intentional infliction of serious violence upon the child. Many involved the intentional murder of multiple young children. Even in those cases, however, determinate sentences were imposed. In some of these cases the criminality of the offending was diminished by the mental disturbance of the offender. In Merritt, Wood CJ at CL said at [65] that the fact that there was ""no decision in this State ... involving the murder by a parent of his or her children, where life sentences have been imposed"", was a factor that could ""properly be taken into account, having regard to the desirability for general consistency and probability in sentencing"". I respectfully adopt those remarks. In the one case that might be regarded as an exception to his Honour's observation, decided after Merritt, an offender was sentenced to life imprisonment for the premeditated murder of his two young grandchildren, aged seven and five, in circumstances where he had just killed his wife and was planning a further murder when arrested: R v Walsh [2009] NSWSC 764.

120The ground of appeal in relation to sentence, as framed by the applicant, is that the sentence which his Honour imposed is ""too severe"". A ground framed in these terms cannot succeed. Even if an appeal court believes that a sentence imposed by the first instance judge is too severe, this Court can intervene only if, in the absence of an identified error, the sentence is so severe that this Court concludes that it is manifestly excessive. The former is commonly referred to as patent error, and the latter, latent error. A sentence affected by latent error is a sentence which in all the circumstances could not reasonably be imposed.

121By her notice of appeal, the applicant concedes that her sentence is not affected by patent error. As I have indicated, his Honour's remarks on sentence are comprehensive, carefully reasoned and, although reasonable minds may differ on some matters, reveal no error.

122I have had the benefit of reading in draft the reasons of Hall and Davies JJ. I do not share in their Honours' criticisms of the trial judge's remarks. Given the significance of this sentence, I should briefly indicate why that is.

123Hall and Davies JJ conclude that the trial judge erred in the sense referred to in House v The King in his consideration of Dr Nielssen's evidence. Their Honours state at [202]-[205], [214] and [223]-[226] of their reasons that the trial judge failed to appreciate that Dr Nielssen's opinion that the applicant suffered from a personality disorder (marked by a deficit of empathy) was based partly on the doctor's own clinical observations of the applicant, as distinct from her self-reported history. Hall and Davies JJ are of the opinion that the error materially affected the trial judge's decision, in that his Honour's principal reason for rejecting Dr Nielssen's evidence was its basis in the applicant's self-reported history, which the trial judge found to be unreliable. Hall and Davies JJ reason that, to the extent that Dr Nielssen's opinion was based solely on his own clinical observations and experience, it ought to have been taken into account. Their Honours conclude that if the opinion were given the appropriate weight, it would have operated to diminish the seriousness of the offence. This is so because Dr Nielssen's evidence offered a causal explanation for the offence, namely that the applicant's failure to respond to Ebony's needs was attributable to her ""deficit of empathy"" rather than her wilful neglect of the child.

124I do not share in their Honours' conclusion. Dr Nielssen's opinion that the applicant suffered from a personality disorder was based on his observations and experience in addition to the applicant's self-reported history. It cannot be assumed that Dr Nielssen would have reached the same conclusion if he had disregarded the history reported to him by the applicant and relied only on his own perception of the applicant. Indeed, Dr Nielssen said in his evidence in the sentencing proceedings that he would ""be cautious about making such a diagnosis [of personality disorder] without quite a lot of corroborative history of the effect of the maladaptive traits over the course of life"". Under cross-examination, he agreed with the proposition that his observations as to the applicant's lack of emotion were made ""in the light of the history [the applicant] was giving you"". Finally, it is made plain in Dr Nielssen's report dated 12 August 2008 that his clinical observations in and of themselves could not support his diagnosis that the applicant suffered from a deficit of empathy. As the following passage from the report shows, the factors supporting his diagnosis were cumulative and included the applicant's self-reported history:

""... features of personality disorder include [the applicant's] abnormal emotional responses, what seemed to be distortions in her interpretation of events, her account of chronically depressed mood and episodes of deliberate self-harm, and her account of putting up with an abusive relationship for as long as she did."" (emphasis added)

125Accordingly, it was open to the trial judge to reject Dr Nielssen's evidence in its entirety because of his Honour's conclusion as to the unreliability of the self-reported history on which it was, in large measure, based. His Honour did not err in taking that course. 

126Hall and Davies JJ further support their conclusion that his Honour erred in dismissing Dr Nielssen's evidence by pointing to a clinical note about the applicant taken in 1997 (at [209]). Their Honours state at [212] of their reasons that the note corroborated that aspect of the applicant's self-reported history in which she recounted to Dr Nielssen the domestic violence to which she was exposed as a child. Hall and Davies JJ find that the corroborative evidence was considered neither by Dr Nielssen in preparing his report, nor by the trial judge in assessing what weight to give Dr Nielssen's opinion (at [211], [213]).

127I cannot conclude that his Honour did not take the clinical note into account. Hall and Davies JJ rely upon the following passage of his Honour's remarks on sentence (at [129]) to make that finding:

""Another matter that Mr Stewart submitted that I should take into account was that [SW] has not been an emotionally healthy person. He contended that this could be traced back to matters such as the domestic violence she witnessed as a child and her commencing her relationship with BW when she was 17 and he was 29. A difficulty with that is that it depends upon a psychiatric or psychological assessment of SW and those which I have are flawed because they are based upon a history that I cannot be satisfied is reliable with regard to crucial matters."" (emphasis added)

128His Honour did not state that there was no corroborative evidence whatsoever that supported any aspect of the applicant's self-reported history. To the contrary, he accepted at [189] that ""[h]er childhood years may have been attended by unhappiness"" - an opinion which must have been informed, at least in part, by the clinical note. 

129However, his Honour emphasised that he could not be satisfied as to the reliability of the self-reported history with regard to crucial matters. Those crucial matters are set out at [118] of the remarks on sentence. They include evidence which directly contradicted the applicant's account that she was in an abusive relationship with BW - an assertion to which the clinical note taken in 1997 does not relate. One of those crucial matters was described by his Honour as follows:

""There is a note in medical records by a social worker in early 2000, in the context of noting behavioural problems in the elder siblings, that '[SW] and [BW] state there is no domestic violence at home and that the children do not observe aggressive behaviours at home'. There is also a note of 21 March 2000 that, '[SW] denies that any problems exist at home with respect to violence, neglect or deprivation. She states that she and [BW] do argue at times but are able to resolve these issues between themselves'.""

130It follows that the clinical note, even if it had escaped his Honour's attention, would not have materially affected the outcome. This is because his Honour was not satisfied as to the reliability of the applicant's self-reported history as a whole. The clinical note corroborated only the applicant's account of her difficult childhood.

131I have given anxious consideration to whether the sentence of life imprisonment is ""manifestly excessive"". In this State, the relevant legislation ensures that a person who receives a life sentence is never to be released. There is no doubting the severity of such a sentence. His Honour's findings with respect to the applicant's moral culpability, his sceptical view of the value of the psychiatric and psychological evidence, and ultimately his conclusion that the case fell within the ""worst-case category"" were fundamental to the sentence which his Honour imposed. Furthermore, by defending the charge at trial the applicant was denied any discount for a guilty plea.

132As I have previously indicated, the applicant challenged the validity of a number of his Honour's other findings. However, every finding was a conclusion which was open to his Honour. No House v The King error can be established.

133I am mindful of the severity of the sentence which his Honour imposed having regard to other sentences imposed for similar offences. However, each case must be considered having regard to the circumstances of the particular offence and of the offender. It cannot be that because a life sentence was not imposed in any particular case, or in any previous case which arose in similar circumstances, that the sentence imposed in the applicant's case was erroneous. As this Court observed in R v Garforth (Unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, 31 March 1994) at [13], notwithstanding the otherwise favourable subjective circumstances of an offender, ""there are some cases where the level of culpability is so extreme that the community interest in retribution and punishment can only be met through the imposition of the maximum penalty"". His Honour found that this was such a case. I am not persuaded that his Honour's conclusion was wrong or that the sentence is manifestly excessive.

134A sentence of life imprisonment in this State has the consequence that an offender will never be released from prison and his or her circumstances may never be reviewed by anybody with a power to review or reduce it. Whether such a sentencing regime is appropriate is not a matter for this Court. It is the responsibility of Parliament to provide the statutory framework within which this Court must exercise its sentencing discretion.

135There remains the issue of whether his Honour erred in not exercising the discretion conferred upon him by s 21(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to impose a determinate sentence, notwithstanding that he was otherwise satisfied that a sentence of life imprisonment was required by s 61(1). His Honour declined to exercise the discretion because in his view the objective gravity of the offence was so extreme that the subjective features of the offender did not displace the prima facie need for the maximum penalty: BW & SW (No 3) at [191].

136For the same reasons the applicant's submissions in relation to review under s 61(1) cannot succeed, her submissions directed to review under s 21(1) cannot succeed. This Court is a court of error. The sentence was affected by neither patent nor latent error. Given his Honour's findings of fact and assessment of the applicant's moral culpability, it was open to him to find that s 21(1) was not engaged by the subjective factors of the case: R v Valera [2002] NSWCCA 50 at [8].

137I would make the following orders:

1. Leave to appeal conviction refused.
2. Grant leave to appeal against the sentence but refuse that appeal.

138HALL and DAVIES JJ:

PART A

139In relation to the appeal against conviction contained in grounds 1 and 2 we agree with McClellan CJ at CL (as his Honour then was) and have nothing to add.

140In relation to the application for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed by Hulme J contained in ground 3 we regret that we cannot agree with the dismissal of the appeal for the following reasons.

141We agree with McClellan CJ at CL that the ground of appeal as framed, namely that the sentence is too severe, cannot succeed. However, as McClellan CJ at CL has done we have considered the ground as if it asserted that the life sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 

142At the conclusion of the hearing in this Court on 30 November 2012, the Court granted leave for the applicant to file additional submissions in support of the application for leave to appeal against sentence.

143On 6 December 2012, additional submissions were filed on behalf of the applicant and the Crown filed additional submissions in response on 11 December 2012. 

144In the additional submissions for the applicant it was stated, for the purposes of clarifying the matters sought to be raised on appeal, that leave was sought to rely upon additional ""subgrounds"" as particulars to the ground that had originally been relied upon. 

145The Crown has not opposed the application for leave to add as particulars of the ground relied upon those set out in paragraph [3] of the additional submissions on behalf of the applicant. In those circumstances, we are of the opinion that leave should be granted to the applicant to rely upon the following additional matters as set out in the additional submissions in the following terms:

i. His Honour erred by reference to comparable cases in finding this matter fell into the 'worst case' category. In particular: see Folbigg [2003] NSWSC 859 and Pfitzer [2010] NSWCCA 314.

ii. His Honour erred in finding that in the circumstances the offence of murder is no less serious even if it was committed by a reckless indifference rather than an intention to kill [ROS 187-188].

iii. His Honour erred in rejecting the evidence of Dr Nielssen, Ms Duffy and even the contention that the Applicant was not an emotionally healthy person in the time leading up to the death of her daughter."" 

PART B

146Section 61 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 relevantly provides:

61 Mandatory life sentences for certain offences

(1) A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence.

147If it is considered that the case falls within that section there remains a residual discretion under s 21(1) of the Act to impose a determinate sentence where the offender's subjective circumstances justify such a course: R v Merritt at [36].

148In R v Kalajzich (1997) 94 A Crim R 41 Hunt CJ at CL said at 50-51:

""The maximum penalty for murder of penal servitude for life, meaning for the term of the prisoner's natural life, is ... reserved for cases falling within the worst category of cases, but it is not reserved only for those cases where the prisoner is likely to remain a continuing danger to society for the rest of his life or for those cases where there is no chance of rehabilitation; the maximum may be appropriate where the level of culpability is so extreme that the community interest in retribution and punishment can only be met by such a punishment.""

149In R v Harris Wood CJ at CL (with whom Giles JA and James J agreed) said:

[84] The features required for qualification in the ""worst case category"" were defined in R v Twala (Court of Criminal Appeal, 4 November 1994, unreported) where it was said (at 7): 

""... in order to characterise any case as being in the worst case category, it must be possible to point to particular features which are of very great heinousness and it must be possible to postulate the absence of facts mitigating the seriousness of the crime (as distinct from the subjective features mitigating the penalty to be imposed)...""

[85] ""Heinousness"" has been described as follows in R v Arthurell (Hunt CJ at CL, 3 October 1996, unreported) at 11:: 

""The adjective 'heinous' which gives the noun 'heinousness' its meaning has been variously defined as meaning atrocious, detestable, hateful, odious, gravely reprehensible and extremely wicked. ... The test to be satisfied is thus a substantial one"".

[86] It was next submitted that the exercise required at common law differed from an assessment of the level of ""culpability"" under s 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, which required a consideration of the reasons for the offending conduct, that is, of the circumstances surrounding or causally connected with the offence, such as the background or mental state of the offender. 

[87] It is not at all clear to me that the assessment whether a case falls within the ""worst case category"" at common law is any different from that postulated under s 61(1). The decision in Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1987) 164 CLR 465, permits reference at common law to background material for the purpose of assessing moral culpability, and dangerous propensity and there is long standing precedent for regard to be had to each of the matters specified in s 61(1) when considering sentence.

[88] Similarly to the view offered by Hunt CJ at CL in R v Kalajzich (1997) 94 A Crim R 41 in relation to the former s 431B(1) of the Crimes Act, I doubt that its successor (s 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act adds anything to the common law. ...

150At [124] his Honour quoted with approval a passage from the Court's judgment in R v Garforth which in turn cited a passage from Hunt J in R v Petroff (Court of Criminal Appeal, 12 November 1991, unreported):

""But first we should emphasise that we do not intend to diminish the terrible significance of a sentence of life imprisonment. Nor did Newman J. His Honour quoted the following passage from the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Petroff (unreported, 12 November 1991):

'The indeterminate nature of a life sentence has long been the subject of criticism by penologists and others concerned with the prison system and the punishment of offenders generally. Such a sentence deprives a prisoner of any fixed goal to aim for, it robs him of any incentive and it is personally destructive of his morale. The life sentence imposes intolerable burdens upon most prisoners because of their incarceration for an indeterminate period, and the result of that imposition has been an increased difficulty in their management by the prison authorities.

We acknowledge the force of these sentiments. That is why life imprisonment is to be imposed only in the worst type of case. Nevertheless, there are cases in which such a severe punishment fits the crime. This is one such case.""

151In considering this matter we do not lose sight of the fact that this Court is a court of error. In Merritt WoodCJ at CL (with whom Tobias JA and Hidden J agreed) said:

[60] The position of this Court, in considering an appeal from such a sentence, is limited by the fact that it is a court of error: Regina v Vachalec [1981] 1 NSWLR 351. It is not sufficient for it to find that some other sentence might possibly have been imposed, or that members of the Court might have themselves imposed a different sentence: Skinner v The Queen (1913) 16 CLR 336 and Regina v O'Donoghue (1988) 34 A Crim R 397. Rather, it must be satisfied that the sentence was wrong, and that some other sentence was warranted and should have been imposed: s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act, and see Regina v Cocking [1999] NSWCCA 311. 

[61] This will require it to be satisfied that there was an error of principle, or a mistake of fact or law, such that the sentencing discretion of the trial judge miscarried. In its review, the Court is also bound by findings of fact by the sentencing judge unless they were not open on the evidence, or unless error is shown in the sense referred to in House v The Queen (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-505; Regina v Kelly (1993) 30 NSWLR 64 and Regina v Khouzame [2000] NSWCCA 505. 

[62] Additionally, while it is appropriate for the Court to correct a sentence which is out of line with the commonly accepted pattern: Regina v Visconti [1982] 2 NSWLR 104, there is limited utility in drawing any direct comparison with a sentence imposed upon another offender, simply because the two offenders appear to have similar characteristics, or to have committed similar crimes. What must be considered is whether the sentence is within the appropriate range, and in that respect, other apparently similar cases merely form part of that range: Regina v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 and Regina v Salameh NSWCCA 9 June 1994.

152We deal separately below with the medical evidence, in particular the evidence of Dr Nielssen, Consultant Psychiatrist, regarding his findings on examinations conducted on the applicant and the extent to which that evidence was evaluated by the sentencing judge. Before doing so, we turn to the subject of sentencing patterns in cases involving the murder by a parent of a child.

153Merritt was a case where the applicant murdered her three children aged 6 years, 11 months and 11 weeks. The Judge at first instance (Greg James J) imposed life sentences for each of the murders: Regina v Merritt [2002] NSWSC 1159. On appeal Wood CJ at CL first reviewed a number of earlier cases involving the murder of offenders' children. He then went on to say:

[65] It is true that these were all cases in which determinant (sic) sentences, including the setting of non-parole periods, were imposed. There has in fact been no decision in this State, so far as I am aware, involving the murder by a parent of his or her children, where life sentences have been imposed, other than the present case. That is a circumstance that can, in my view, properly be taken into account, having regard to the desirability for general consistency and predictability in sentencing. To so hold is not to offend against the principles considered in Veen (No 2) v The Queen (1988) 164 CLR 465 or Regina v Twala (NSWCCA, 4 November 1994 unreported), and see also Regina v Kalajzich (1997) 94 A Crim R 41 at 51, which make it clear that it is an incorrect approach to sentencing to compare the facts of the case at hand with other cases in order to determine whether it does or does not fall within the worst case category, deserving of the maximum sentence. (emphasis added)

154He then went on to say:

[66] A brief review of some of the cases where life sentences have, in fact, been imposed for cases of murder, was undertaken by me in the reasons for sentence which I delivered in Regina v Penisini [2003] NSWSC 892. They display somewhat different characteristics, and in particular were either wholly, or in the main, cases of extreme violence, where the offender's psychiatric or emotional state either did not contribute to the offence, or had very limited significance; or where his or her future dangerousness to the community was demonstrably evident. Some were cases of underworld murders, one involved a political killing; all were cases which involved a significant threat to society and a need for a strong element of personal and general deterrence. Little purpose is, accordingly, to be derived by further reference to them.

[67] As I have observed, reference to the decisions that I have expressly cited is appropriate, so long as they are understood to form part of an overall sentencing pattern. Ultimately each case must be determined upon its own facts, and by reference to the legislative provisions, which set the available maximum, or which otherwise give direction as to the sentence which is to be imposed.

155Accordingly, it is appropriate to consider other cases to see whether a decision is out of line with the commonly accepted pattern for sentences and it is appropriate to do that when considering if the offence falls within s 61(1) prior to dealing with the final discretion enabling the imposition of a determinate sentence under s 21(1). This is apparent from what appears in Merritt particularly at [69] and the later consideration of the applicant's subjective circumstances at [75]-[76].

156In Merritt a question of the proper construction of s 61(1) was raised in terms of the four indicia mentioned in that section (retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence). The four possible interpretations were said at [42] to be these:

That a life sentence is required if the culpability is so extreme that the community interest 
(1) in any one of the four indicia, 
(2) in each of the four indicia, 
(3) in the combined effect of such of the four indicia as are applicable, and 
(4) that the combined effect of the four indicia with each contributing to some degree, 

is such that it could only be met by such a sentence. 

157Wood CJ at CL's conclusion at [54] was that the third of the possible interpretations was correct and that:

""[I]t follows that the absence of any finding of future dangerousness would not rule out an application of the section."" 

158Tobias JA, whilst agreeing with Wood CJ at CL and with his Honour's reasons, said he wished to add a comment with respect to the interpretation of s 61(1):

""[4] Notwithstanding the absence of one or more of the statutory indicia, the presence and level of significance of the other or others may still lead to the conclusion that the level of culpability is so extreme that the community interest can only be met through the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment for life. 

[5] Obviously, the absence of any one or more of those indicia will make it more difficult for a trial judge to reach the state of satisfaction required by the section before such a sentence is mandated (subject always to s 61(3)). This is particularly so as the trial judge must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the level of culpability is so extreme as to require the imposition of that sentence. 

[6] It would, I tend to think, be a rare case where the total absence of one or more of the indicia will still permit the relevant degree of satisfaction to be attained. On the other hand, as his Honour observes in [53] of his judgment, absence of the need for personal, as distinct from general, deterrence, is unlikely to influence the decision to any significant degree.""

159Hidden J agreed with Wood CJ at CL but also with the additional remarks of Tobias JA.

160McClellan CJ at CL, at [**117**] of his Honour's judgment in the present case, having noted what Wood CJ at CL had said in Merritt concerning sentences in other cases, summarised a number of relevant cases involving the murder of a child or stepchild by a parent. To those, we would add the following:

R v RHB [2007] NSWSC 1466. 

161The offender had been charged with murdering in 1993 a child of his then partner. The child was then aged 14 months. He was also charged with murdering in 2004 the child of a later partner. That child was aged two at the date of his death. He was tried for both offences at the same time. The jury returned a verdict of manslaughter in respect of the first child but murder in respect of the second. In both cases the injuries were very similar and involved severe head injuries which might have been caused by shaking but could also have been caused by other forces. Hall J considered at length whether it was appropriate to impose a life sentence in respect of the murder conviction. His Honour found that the injuries manifested uncontrolled aggression on the offender's part. He went on to say:

""[93] As earlier noted, imprisonment for life is reserved for cases that may properly be described as a worst category. For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the gradations which the law recognises, I observe that premeditated murders committed simply for financial gain or carried out with great cruelty or which involve, not one, but multiple murders are the type of case or cases that may fall within the worst category. The offence in this case on Count 2 did not, as I have stated, on my assessment, fall into that particular category and is to be judged against the appropriate, if not, imprecise, standards of criminality.""

162His Honour imposed an overall sentence of 30 years with a non-parole period of 20 years. 

R v John Walsh [2009] NSWSC 764. 

163In this case the offender pleaded guilty to the murder of his wife and his two grandchildren as well as causing grievous bodily harm to his daughter with intent to murder her. McCallum J said that the evidence did not establish any identifiable abnormality of the mind that was causally related to the offences such as to reduce the offender's culpability but she said the circumstances were disturbing enough to suggest that the offender was not in a normal state of mind. 

164Her Honour said she found the comparison with other cases ultimately unhelpful for the purpose of determining whether the case before her fell within the worst class of case or the category described in s 61(1). She imposed a life sentence for the murder of the two grandchildren but a sentence of 20 years with a non-parole period of 15 years for the murder of the offender's wife. 

R v Mehta [2009] NSWSC 814

165The offender pleaded guilty to the murder of his wife and his wife's 9yearold daughter by a previous marriage. The offender had strangled his wife after an argument and the child witnessed the murder. The offender disposed of the bodies by throwing them over a cliff face. There was evidence that his wife's murder was financially motivated. There were few details about the precise acts causing the child's death, however, based on statements made by the offender to a fellow prisoner whilst the offender was in custody, Grove J was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he killed her because she had seen him in the act of strangling her mother. 

166His Honour noted that whilst the murder of the offender's wife could be characterised as carried out in circumstances of extreme domestic acrimony involving a loss of control that would preclude it from falling into the worst category, there was no evidence which demonstrated that the second murder was carried out in such circumstances of panic and confusion. His Honour assessed the murder of the child as falling within the worst category and imposed a life sentence. A sentence of 30 years was imposed for the murder of the offender's wife. His Honour found that the offender expressed no remorse or contrition for the offending and that there were no subjective features which would displace the need for a life sentence.

R v De Gruchy [2000] NSWCCA 51; (2000) 110 A Crim R 271

167The offender was convicted after trial of the murder of his mother, his sister and brother, all killed at the same time. He was sentenced in respect of each murder to concurrent minimum terms of 21 years with an additional term of seven years. He effectively abandoned his application for leave to appeal against sentence with this Court noting that the sentences imposed ""were manifestly appropriate for the offences of which the Appellant was convicted"" (at [1]).

R v Alexander [1999] NSWSC 413

168This was an application for a redetermination of two life sentences previously imposed by Slattery J in 1987 for the murder of a woman and her daughter. The offender rented part of the woman's premises from her. After an argument concerning the rent he strangled her. When in the course of hiding the body he was seen by her three year daughter. He then murdered her by striking her with a piece of wood and stabbing her. Kirby J redetermined the sentence for each offence to a minimum term of 21 years with an additional term of eight years. (We accept that for the purposes of redetermination of sentences matters may be taken into account that post-date the original imposition of the life sentence.) 

R v Jang [1999] NSWSC 1153

169The offender pleaded guilty on the morning of the commencement of his trial for the murder of his wife and his wife's daughter by a previous marriage. The wife had acted as his sponsor for the purposes of immigration but ultimately she refused to sign the necessary papers to permit the offender being granted permanent residence. He had threatened to kill her and her family if she did not do so. He ultimately argued with his wife about her failure to sign the papers and then killed her by stabbing her. Her daughter came to her aid and he stabbed her also. Bell J sentenced him on each count to a minimum term of 18 years with an additional term of six years.

170An examination of all of the abovementioned cases shows that, even in those involving multiple murders, the only times a life sentence has been imposed were in Walsh and Mehta. Merritt, Folbigg,Fraser,Cikos, Cheatham, Velevski, Park, Alexander and Jang were all cases involving the murder of more than one family member and in Merritt, Folbigg, Fraser, Cikos, Velevski and Park two or more children were murdered by the offender. In none of those cases was it considered appropriate to impose a life sentence. As Wood CJ at CL said in Merritt at [65] that is a circumstance that can be properly be taken into account having regard to the desirability for general consistency and predictability in sentencing.

171It is necessary, however, to examine whether, in the light of the evidence and the Sentencing Judge's findings on the objective seriousness of the offence, it is correct to conclude that the community interest can only be met through the imposition of a life sentence. If the case could not be considered to be in the worst category such a conclusion would not be open.

PART C

Submissions on additional Grounds

172In the additional submissions for the applicant it is stated that deterioration in the applicant's care of the deceased child subsequent to mid-2006 is unexplained in the absence of the psychiatric and psychological evidence which, it was contended, had been dismissed by the sentencing judge, being the evidence given respectively by Dr Nielssen and Ms Duffy: Additional Written Submissions on behalf of the applicant at [11].

173It was further submitted on behalf of the applicant that his Honour had erred in dismissing the evidence of Dr Nielssen and Ms Duffy, and in dismissing the significance of her addiction to prescribed medication: Additional Written Submissions on behalf of the Applicant at [12].

174It was also submitted on behalf of the applicant that while it was open for his Honour to have reservations regarding the history given by the applicant to Dr Nielssen and Ms Duffy, their evidence should have been given significant weight: Additional Written Submissions on behalf of the applicant at [14].

175The Crown, in response, submitted that the sentencing judge had given an entirely conventional explanation for placing ""little weight"" on the reports of Dr Nielssen and Ms Duffy, namely that the applicant had given each of them a history with so many conflicts that the history did not provide a proper basis for substantial weight to be afforded to the opinions that were based upon them: Crown's Further Submissions at [38].

176The Crown also submitted that:

""While there may have been some psychiatric and/or psychological explanation for the offence, it is by no means axiomatic that such an explanation would necessarily mitigate the sentence that was imposed"": at [39].

177The Crown, for reasons developed in its further submissions, submitted that the Court would reject the submission that absence of a finding by the learned sentencing judge that there was a psychiatric and/or psychological ""explanation"" for the subject offence, the absence of an intention to kill and/or an ""associated motive"" provided any basis for a finding that his Honour erred in failing to make any such finding of fact or otherwise: Crown's Further Submissions at [44]. 

178The Crown also observed that the learned sentencing judge had clearly and at length set out the reasons for attributing little weight to the reports of Dr Nielssen and Ms Duffy: Crown's Further Submissions at [49].

179The Crown submitted that the reasons given by the sentencing judge were ""... perfectly sound and rested in large measure upon the patent and irreconcilable inconsistencies in the histories given by the Applicant, including her own evidence on sentence"": Crown's Further Submissions at [50].

PART D

Findings by the Sentencing Judge

180In the remarks on sentence, the sentencing judge set out the subjective circumstances of the applicant at [82]-[129]. In those paragraphs his Honour comprehensively detailed relevant factual matters. He, in particular, noted Dr Nielssen's observations, as set out below, at [89] in the Sentencing Remarks.

181His Honour referred to the history given by the applicant to Dr Nielssen, including a history that she had been under the control of her husband, had lost the capacity to act on her own behalf and had little say in the care of the children. She claimed that he had been physically abusive towards her: at [91]. 

182The sentencing judge observed that in the concluding paragraph of Dr Nielssen's report, a distinction was made between the applicant's capacity to appreciate the physical circumstances of the child and her ability to respond to the child's needs. That distinction was, in light of Dr Nielssen's reported clinical findings, one of importance. It was a distinction referred to again in Dr Nielssen's oral evidence. In that respect, his Honour observed:

""103 In oral evidence the doctor explained the last sentence of that paragraph by saying that he did not think that [the applicant's] capacity to appreciate the physical circumstances of the child were greatly affected other than to say that she probably became used to the child's poor health. He said it was more in her capacity to attend to the child's needs which was very much limited by her husband's control of the situation, both with money and her personal freedom and also her own physical limitations in being able to keep her house clean and [attend to] the child.""

183It was the second aspect of the applicant's ""capacity"" which was potentially of significance in the respects discussed below, not her ability to see or appreciate the deteriorating circumstances of the child which she clearly was able to do.

184The sentencing judge observed that much of what was stated by way of conclusion by Dr Nielssen depended upon whether one accepted the evidence of the applicant as to those matters. Dr Nielssen, it was noted, had conceded that his view of her personality was, to a large degree, dependent upon an acceptance of the history that she had provided. The history, it was observed, could not in itself explain why the applicant would not have noticed a change in the child's appearance from March 2006 to November 2007.

185On the question of the control and abuse by the applicant's husband as recorded in the applicant's history, the sentencing judge relied on matters set out at [106] of the remarks on sentence for doubting the history given as to the husband's physical abuse of the applicant. His Honour noted that Dr Nielssen did not have the benefit of viewing a lengthy recording made on 9 November 2007 when police executed a search warrant at the home. It was obvious on viewing the recording that the applicant's husband was co-operative and compliant, whilst the applicant was, as between the two of them, dominant and assertive. His Honour then referred to the fact that at an early stage the applicant snatched the occupier's notice out of her husband's hands as he was trying to read it. She insisted on making calls in the kitchen as police were endeavouring to have her remain in the living room and that whilst her husband was content for the police to seize whatever they wished, the applicant made a number of demands about what she considered they could, and could not, take. She had even asserted her view that the police should not even look at certain material: at [106].

186The sentencing judge noted that Dr Nielssen agreed that these were not the types of behaviours usually associated with a person the subject of ""battered women's syndrome"". Dr Nielssen had been unaware of the applicant's conduct at the time the search warrant was executed or of the fact that she had acted physically towards her husband in times of dispute.

187His Honour stated that there was a very real question as to whether the applicant should be believed in respect of the history she gave to Dr Nielssen and Ms Duffy and the evidence she had given to the Court about her relationship with her husband: [118]. In that paragraph, his Honour set out as 13 dot points matters that could be said to evidence inconsistencies, some of which related to the accounts that had been given by the applicant to Dr Nielssen and Ms Duffy.

188His Honour concluded that there may have been some level of domestic violence in the relationship (at [119]) but that he considered that it was more likely that it was relatively minor and had occurred in years past rather than in more recent times. He could not accept that the level of violence, control and domination by the applicant's husband was anywhere near that which the applicant had claimed.

189His Honour was also not satisfied that the evidence the applicant gave about the level of her use of prescription medication could be accepted (at [120]).

190A further problem, his Honour noted, in accepting the opinions of both Dr Nielssen and Ms Duffy, was that they made their assessments and wrote their reports prior to the trial. They assessed the applicant on the basis of her account of events and not on the basis of the jury's verdict which, his Honour was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, involved an acceptance that the applicant fully realised the probability of the child dying and deliberately omitted to do anything about it: (at [121]). 

191His Honour accordingly noted that Dr Nielssen and Ms Duffy had not taken into consideration the applicant's proven guilt in formulating the opinions they expressed earlier in their reports. His Honour then concluded:

""... the various problems I have identified in relation to the reports and evidence of Dr Nielssen and Ms Duffy mean that I can place little weight upon them"": (at [121])

PART F

The Expert Medical Evidence

192The evidence given at the sentencing hearing by Dr Olav Nielssen, Consultant Psychiatrist, and Ms Anita Duffy, Psychologist, was relied upon in support of the application for leave to appeal. No other consultant psychiatrist gave evidence at the sentence hearing.

193Dr Nielssen conducted a mental state examination of the applicant on two occasions, namely, on 18 March 2008 and 27 June 2008. He provided a report dated 12 August 2008 which was tendered at the sentence hearing (Exhibit S2). He was called to give evidence on 6 August 2009.

194There was also tendered on behalf of the applicant a report written by Ms Duffy dated 27 April 2009, (Exhibit S3).

195Dr Nielssen set out in his report, relevant matters of history which he discussed under the subtitles, History elicited from [the applicant], Psychiatric History, Medical History and History of Substance Abuse and Other History.

196At pages 6-7 of the report, details of the mental state examinations were recorded. In relation to the examination conducted on 18 March 2008, Dr Nielssen, inter alia, wrote:

""... there was no obvious signs of neurological disorder, such as abnormal gait or tremor. Her manner was reserved and her range of emotional expression was restricted in that she did not appear especially depressed or angry despite the subject matter being discussed. She was briefly tearful when discussing the plea at the end of the interview ..."" 

197In relation to the mental state examination conducted on 27 June 2008, Dr Nielssen wrote:

""[The applicant] presented unchanged and did not appear to have gained weight during her period of imprisonment ... Her range of emotional expression was again quite limited and she did not appear pervasively depressed. There were again no objective features of psychotic illness or any form of intellectual impairment. During the second interview there was more evidence of a tendency to blame others and distortions in the interpretation of events suggesting the presence of maladaptive personality traits.""

198Dr Nielssen stated in his report that it was not clear that the applicant met the accepted criteria for the diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder. In the Opinion section of his report however, he wrote, inter alia:

""... features of personality disorder include [the applicant's] abnormal emotional responses, what seemed to be distortions in her interpretation of events, her account of chronically depressed mood and episodes of deliberate self-harm, and her account of putting up with an abusive relationship for as long as she did. Her alleged failure to provide adequate care for her children was also consistent with impairment in the capacity for empathy associated with severe personality disorder."" (emphasis added)

Analysis of Dr Nielssen's Evidence

199In evaluating the expert opinion evidence of Dr Nielssen, it is necessary to identify and to distinguish both the foundations for his opinion and the specific matters to which his evidence was directed.

200In both his report and in oral evidence, he initially considered and discussed a range of issues. In doing so he excluded presence of a psychotic illness, or intellectual impairment, and he specified the difficulties in diagnosing what he termed ""a major psychiatric disorder"". He did identify the presence of features of a personality disorder (stated to include what he detected as being the applicant's abnormal emotional responses).

201Dr Nielssen said that he carried out his clinical observations of the applicant during ""two lengthy interviews"": Report at p 7. The observations that he said he made during both interviews related to what he detected as the applicant's ""limited"" emotional expression and her ""abnormal emotional responses"". These were the matters to which he made repeated reference in his report concerning his ""mental state examinations"" conducted on 18 March 2008 and 27 June 2008 and in the ""Opinion"" section of his report. In the latter he referred to the alleged failure of the applicant to provide adequate care for her children as consistent with impairment in the capacity for empathy associated with severe personality disorder (p 8).

202In this latter respect there is a fundamental distinction to be made between on the one hand Dr Nielssen's specific clinical observations and findings made on 18 March 2008 and 27 June 2008, and medical opinions stated as having been derived from patient (the applicant's) history, on the other.

203In this case, Dr Nielssen stated that in both his interviews he detected in both the applicant's responses and his perception of her, that she exhibited what he considered to be consistent with emotional impairment. It is clear that Dr Nielssen expressed his findings and conclusions, made in his capacity as an experienced consultant psychiatrist as having been based on what he observed, rather than based on matters of the applicant's history. Other issues canvassed, in particular in crossexamination with Dr Nielssen, such as battered women's syndrome, were, on the other hand, dependent on the reliability of interview histories. 

204There was no challenge to what Dr Nielssen said he actually observed in the interviews so far as the issue of emotional impairment was concerned. Nor was he challenged on his interpretation of what he said he saw as constituting evidence of emotional impairment. Dr Nielssen said that what he observed on both interviews with the applicant he had also observed in patients with psychiatric disorders in the course of his practice.

205In analysing Dr Nielssen's evidence there is a further matter which should not be overlooked. The fact that Dr Nielssen said he observed what to him was consistent with emotional impairment is not to be conflated with a separate issue, namely, the circumstances in the applicant's life that may have caused her emotional impairment. The circumstances that caused it were not essential to Dr Nielssen's observations that she was exhibiting signs of personality disorder. As to causal factors, he referred to early childhood exposure to domestic violence as a matter that is correlated with the development of an abnormal capacity for emotional response as well as other influences including violence or the influence of a partner as other possible contributing factors. In summary, once Dr Nielssen stated that there were observable signs indicating the presence of an abnormal range of emotional expression, the precise cause or causes or contributing factors are of little consequence. The fact remains that no one suggested that Dr Nielssen was in error in saying what he said he had observed during the course of his interviews with the applicant and there was no suggestion made that Dr Nielssen had erred in ascribing diagnostic significance to the observations that he made.

206In relation to the applicant's limited emotional expression noted at page 7 of the report (reproduced in [ REF _Ref355709851 \r \h 196] and [ REF _Ref355709861 \r \h 198] above), Dr Nielssen in oral evidence stated that the applicant was describing distressing topics ""in a fairly bland way with little in the way of sadness or anger or other outward emotion, and it wasn't sort of the flattening of an emotional expression that you often see in people who are severely depressed, it was more a lack of emotional reaction"" (T 6 August 2009, at 16.9-14).

207He went on to say that he thought it was ""highly abnormal"" for the applicant not to burst into tears at some stage during her interview and that it was ""quite unusual"". As to possible causal factors he said:

""My interpretation of it was that either she had a personality with - a personality type like a lifelong temperament or personalitythat lacked emotional reaction, or else her restriction in emotional range was a consequence of longstanding abuse, that is, it was her defence against longstanding fear of physical assault or emotional abuse"": (T 16.19-25) (emphasis added)

208Dr Nielssen later in evidence-in-chief, was asked to explain how the limitation on the applicant's emotional responses emerged in her life:

""Q. Given the history that [the applicant] gave to you, how do you explain or interpret how that characteristic of [the applicant] emerged in her life? In other words, how did that shutting down or limitation in her emotional responses, how did that develop over a period of time?
A. Well again, I can only go on the history I have and it's supported to some extent by the history from Ms Duffy, which is actually a much more detailed history of her early life experiences, so when I interviewed [the applicant] she denied observing domestic violence in her family of origin, whereas it seems that that was an important influence. So the origins of it seemed to be in aspects of her upbringing. But then her experiences in adult life appear to have reinforced it and interfered with her normal emotional development to a mature state and that her emotional numbing, I thought, was probably due to the experience of being in a long term abusive relationship on a background of events in her own childhood and adolescence."" (T 19.1-15). (emphasis added)

209Apart from the history elicited by Ms Duffy as to domestic violence in her family of origin as a possible causative factor, there was other evidence that could be considered as corroborative of the history of a violent early life upbringing as recorded by Ms Duffy which does not appear to have been directly referred to during the sentencing hearing. In a record made by a social worker at South Western Sydney Area Health Service in 1997, whilst the applicant was an in-patient, the clinical records include an entry made on 8 September 1997 which included the following statement:

""history of domestic violence between [the applicant's] parents. Mother an alcoholic.""

The note went on to state that the husband at the time of admission was supportive and he had identified a number of issues as set out in the clinical note at AB 1096.

210In the remarks on sentence the sentencing judge observed: 

""129 Another matter that Mr Stewart submitted that I should take into account was that [the applicant] ""has not been an emotionally healthy person"". He contended that this could be traced back to matters such as the domestic violence she witnessed as a child and her commencing her relationship with [her husband] when she was 17 and he was 29. A difficulty with that is that it depends upon a psychiatric or psychological assessment of [the applicant] and those which I have are flawed because they are based upon a history that I cannot be satisfied is reliable with regard to crucial matters.""

211It is important here to observe that the remarks on sentence do not suggest that the sentencing judge had been taken to the clinical record of 8 September 1997 to which reference has been made above at [ REF _Ref350875607 \r \h 209] in which a history of the applicant's exposure to domestic violence (later described in graphic terms by Ms Duffy) was recorded. It will be recalled that Dr Nielssen had identified such early life experiences as a possible causative factor giving rise to an abnormality in emotional development and as providing, at least to some extent, a possible explanation for what he himself detected as being consistent with an impairment in the applicant's capacity for empathy which he stated is associated with severe personality disorder.

212Although the history recorded by the social worker in 1997 was a history given by the applicant herself, nonetheless it was a history given in a very different setting to the one provided to Ms Duffy. It concerned the applicant herself, not her children, in the course of an assessment of a medical condition which had apparently led to her admission for treatment and possible referral for counselling. In other words, it was not a history given in a context in which she was being investigated in relation to the care of her children.

213It appears that Dr Nielssen had apparently been unaware of the corroborative evidence of the applicant's childhood history recorded in the clinical notes made in 1997 (para [ REF _Ref350875607 \r \h 209] above). The fact that he did not have that information and yet made observations as to early life experiences, if anything, establishes his perspicacity in referring to early life experiences as a factor known to be linked with such lack of emotional responsiveness as he found on both examinations.

214It is true, as the sentencing judge observed, that the history as to the relationship between the applicant and her husband depended upon her own history and that was found to be unreliable. However, the sentencing judge's observation in that respect did not, as earlier noted, undermine Dr Nielssen's evidence as to observable abnormalities which he stated had diagnostic significance. Nor, on Dr Nielssen's evidence, did it necessarily negate as a possible causal factor the applicant's early childhood experience in what he referred to as ""emotional numbing"".

215Dr Nielssen saw the lack of emotional reaction in the applicant as either being due to a lifelong temperament or personality issue or as being due to physical abuse and/or emotional abuse in adult life or both.

216As to the significance of the observations made by him, he said:

""... a lack of emotional responsiveness and that could translate to her lack of capacity for empathy or ability to recognise another person's feelings."" (T 18.40-45).

217He was asked:

Q. ""Would you expect that that characteristic would impact on a person's capacity to respond to and empathise with persons close to her?
A. Yes.

Q. Including children?
A. Yes."" (T 18.45-50)

218Dr Nielssen elaborated upon the significance of his assessment of the applicant and distinguished two aspects, namely, her capacity to appreciate the child's needs and her capacity to attend to the child's needs. He gave the following evidence:

Q. At the end of your report you stated that the combination of her own physical problems and her lack of initiative may have affected her capacity to appreciate the state of her child's health or attending to her needs. When you say, may have affected her capacity, are you talking about a matter of degree?
A. Yes.

Q. So is it your opinion that to some extent her capacity may have been affected?
A. Yes, two parts; to appreciate how unwell her child was, and her child's circumstances, which were pretty dire, but also her capacity to do something about it, are likely to have been affected.

Q. How does being in that kind of relationship and plus having the particular physical problems that she had, and also her particular personality as it developed, how does that operate to affect her capacity to appreciate?
A. Well, I don't think her capacity to appreciate the physical circumstances were greatly affected, other than to say that she probably became habituated, became used to the squalor and to the child's poor health, but it was more in her capacity to attend to the child's needs, which according to the history I obtained was very much limited by her husband's control of the situation, both with money, with her personal freedom, and also her physical limitations in being able to keep the house clean and to tend to the child.

Q. Given your particular opinions as you've expressed them, are you able to say that her particular problems and her particular lack of initiative as you based on her history, that that would impact on her to some degree fail to appreciate the condition of her child, who for some period of time leading up to her death was suffering from gross chronic malnutrition?
A. Yes. There must have been, and again, it's hard to - hard for me to link the person I interviewed with the facts of the case, but there must have been quite a disruption of capacity for empathy for the child, over and above any limitation on her freedom of movement and freedom of action.

Q. You said it was hard to link the person that you spoke to with the facts of the case. What did you mean by that?
A. Well, again, she seemed quite intelligent, was well groomed, seemed to be a competent sort of person, and also her reactions when these details were put to her, because that's how the interviews unfolded. I read from the documents and asked her to respond, and it was difficult to reconcile the lack of response and also her answers to the objective circumstances. (T 21.3022.19)

219Whilst the secondlast answer does not refer to the applicant's lack of emotional responsiveness in terms of her early life experiences, but rather refers to her husband's alleged control, it is not a retraction of (i) his reported findings on his clinical observations referred to in [ REF _Ref355709851 \r \h 196] and [ REF _Ref356818396 \r \h 197] above; (ii) the link or association to which he earlier referred between relevant early life experiences and the applicant's observed lack of emotional response or capacity for empathy.

220In cross-examination the Crown took up the issue of her lack of emotion with Dr Nielssen (at T 26-27). Dr Nielssen was asked by the Crown Prosecutor:

""Q. What I'm saying to you is what you observed as to lack of emotion is capable of more than one explanation?
A. Yes.

Q. Your assessment of it as reported, is in the light of the history she was giving you?
A. Yes.

Q. You use the expression in relation to an answer from Mr Stewart of a lack of empathy?
A. Yes.

Q. Well a lack of empathy in relation to what had happened to the child would result in no emotion to that, wouldn't it?
A. Yes there was a lack - the apparent lack of emotion whilst describing the child's condition suggested perhaps a lack of empathy there. A lack of capacity to recognise the other person's feelings.

Q. Nothing that she described to you would in any way in your opinion, affect her eyesight would it?
A. I'm sorry?

Q. None of the history she gave you, none of the emotions or the effects that you noticed would in any way reflect to indicate there was anything wrong with her eyesight?
A. No.""

221The questioning then moved on to other topics. It is noted that the above line of questioning by the Crown Prosecutor commenced with an examination of Dr Nielssen's evidence on the issue of the applicant's capacity to empathise but without exploring or challenging Dr Nielssen's evidence any further on that issue the cross-examination deviated in the last two questions to the issue of the applicant's ability to visually see the child's condition. In other words, the consequences or significance of a lack of the applicant's capacity in terms of her emotional capacity to respond as referred to by Dr Nielssen in both his report and oral evidence was not analysed in cross-examination. Dr Nielssen addressed as a quite separate issue the applicant's ability to physically see the child's condition. After he was shown Exhibit L, a photograph of the child taken in December 2004, he agreed that it would defy commonsense and logic that anyone would not notice a difference in a child's condition which at an earlier time had been described as being a healthy chubby six year old and what was subsequently described in the autopsy report and by Dr O'Loughlin. 

222Accordingly, whilst the above segment of the cross-examination commenced with the issue addressed by Dr Nielssen as to the applicant's lack of emotion, it deviated from that issue to the issue of the capacity of a person to physically see and identify the deteriorating physical condition of the child rather than to the applicant's capacity to respond to what she was seeing. Dr Nielssen's evidence, on more than one occasion, had drawn the distinction between her capacity to physically see the condition of the child, and her capacity to respond to the needs of the child.

223It is of some significance to observe that whilst Dr Nielssen dealt with matters of history in his report under the specific subheadings referred to in para [ REF _Ref355965119 \r \h 195] above, it was his clinical or objective observations on the applicant's lack of emotional response on both examinations, that formed the basis for his opinion concerning her emotional state, in particular her lack of capacity for empathy. Plainly in both his report and in his oral evidence, Dr Nielssen stated that this feature was present on both examinations and that it conformed with what he identified as ""features of personality disorder"", described as the applicant's ""abnormal emotional responses"". Its relevance to the issue of the applicant's moral culpability was that in Dr Nielssen's opinion it wasconsistent with ""impairment in the capacity for empathy associated with severe personality disorder"": (p 8). It has not been overlooked that Dr Nielssen identified the fact of abnormal emotional response as but one of other stated features that together could support a diagnosis of ""personality disorder"".

224It was not put or suggested to Dr Nielssen in cross-examination, a highly experienced and respected forensic psychiatrist, that the abnormal emotional response he detected in the applicant was something that could have been feigned by her. Nor, as earlier noted, was it suggested to Dr Nielssen that his observations were flawed or that his mental state observations upon which he reported and the significance he attached to them were without a proper basis or support. 

225Dr Nielssen's clinical observations and his diagnostic assessment as to the existence of an impairment in the applicant's capacity for empathy could not, in our opinion, be given no weight, particularly in circumstances in which the validity of his observations and conclusions were not the subject of direct challenge.

226Whilst, with respect, the sentencing judge's conclusions as to the unreliability of the applicant's history on the issue of physical abuse and domination by her husband were certainly open to him, that did not, for the reasons we have identified, in our opinion, detract from or dispose of Dr Nielssen's other observations and conclusions which were not based solely upon history found to be unreliable. The finding as to the applicant's unreliability as a historian on matters concerning her relationship with her husband in other words could not remove the identified basis for Dr Nielssen's opinion, based as it was upon his clinical findings on the examinations of the applicant. 

227The only question raised upon a matter arising from Dr Nielssen's evidence on this aspect of the matter was a question put by the sentencing judge to him at T 30:

""HIS HONOUR:

Q. I'll take you to page 8 of your report. The first sentence on the page you refer to 'doubts about whether the diagnosis of personality order is sufficiently reliable to be used as evidence in court'. Can you explain that please?
A. Yes, it's, I mean there's some debate as to where personality disorder sits within the psychiatric diagnostic system and one of the studies that sticks in my mind is of people who have been diagnosed with personality disorder being assessed 6 months later and it's supposed to be a life long disorder, but only 50 per cent of them were given that diagnosis, and I would say that level of diagnostic reliability is not high enough. Perhaps the other qualification I would say that I'd be cautious about making such a diagnosis without quite a lot of corroborative history of the effect of the maladaptive traits over the course of life.

Q. So you'd want to look behind the history given by the person?
A. Yes.""

228There are three observations to be made arising from this evidence. Dr Nielssen made specific findings consistent with the presence of a personality trait or abnormality (a lack of emotional responsiveness) which, in his opinion, which, together with other matters that he identified, could go towards supporting a diagnosis of personality disorder although he did not suggest a definitive diagnosis of that kind in this case. Secondly, as to the significance of his findings, he said that his observations of the applicant suggested that there was a lack of empathy - a lack of capacity to recognise another person's feelings: (T 26.40-45). Thirdly, the association of ""emotional numbing"" was considered by him to be consistent with an exposure to domestic violence early in life. As stated above, there was evidence to that effect in this case.

229In the absence of any reason to the contrary, Dr Nielssen's opinion evidence was cogent evidence that went directly to the question of the objective culpability of the applicant and was evidence that had to be taken into account.

230In assessing her moral culpability, the effect of the evidence was, in our opinion, to distinguish the applicant from cases in the worst category such as the killer who acts with cold deliberation, with full capacity and who is prepared to commit a felonious act from motives such as greed or other self-interest. 

231In the light of authority we do not consider that the offence can be regarded as falling within the worst category of cases nor that the level of culpability is so extreme that the community interest in the four statutory indicia can only be met through the imposition of a life sentence. Not only does it not fall within the sort of cases referred to by Wood CJ at CL in Merritt at [66], the case is so exceptional that it is doubtful that personal or general deterrence is of such significance as requiring the sentence imposed. Hulme J accepted, as we do, that protection of the community was not relevant.

232The result is that whilst retribution and punishment were of paramount significance, one of the statutory indicia was entirely lacking (community protection) and the other (specific deterrence) was of minimal significance. 

233In addition, the following matters are relevant either as tempering the objective criminality or as bearing on the residual discretion under s 21(1):

(a) The applicant did not deliberately set out upon a long term plan to kill the child;

(b) The applicant had no prior convictions nor any prior history of violence towards the other children; 

(c) The applicant accepted that she had a level of criminal responsibility for the death of the child and accepted that the jury could return a verdict of guilty of manslaughter.

(d) Both the applicant and the co-offender abused prescription drugs including Valium and Panadeine Forte although the sentencing judge found that the applicant's use was not as great as she made out. 

(e) The psychometric testing carried out by Ms Duffy (as the sentencing judge said) could not be discounted although there were some difficulties associated with it, not the least of which was that some of it was dependent upon the applicant's own account which his Honour did not entirely accept. However, that testing demonstrated elevated scores on a number of scales including Borderline Personality, Depression, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Anxiety, Thought Disorder and Dissociation.

234In our opinion it cannot be said that the present case is within the worst case category nor that the level of culpability was so extreme that the community interest can only be met by the imposition of a life sentence. The evidence of Dr Nielssen to which we have referred, in our opinion, provides an additional or separate basis for that conclusion.

235In our opinion the following orders should be made with respect to Ground 3:

(1)Grant leave to appeal.

(2)Allow the appeal.

(3)Quash the sentence imposed by Hulme J.

(4)In lieu, sentence the appellant to a non-parole period of 30 years commencing 17 November 2007 and expiring 16 November 2037 with an additional term of 10 years expiring 16 November 2047.

2706624,Paul Darcey Armstrong v R [2013] NSWCCA 137,"Judgment

1THE COURT: This Court made orders in these proceedings on 20 May 2013: see [2013] NSWCCA 113. The appellant was then in custody serving a sentence following his conviction for murder that was the subject of his appeal to this Court. That sentence was one of 17 years commencing on 4 December 2008 expiring on 3 December 2025 with a non-parole period of 11 years and 6 months expiring on 3 June 2020.

2The orders that were made by this Court on 20 May 2013 were as follows:

1. Grant leave to appeal.
2. Allow the appeal.
3. Quash the conviction.
4. Order that there be a new trial.

3Following his conviction and the imposition of his sentence for murder, the appellant was sentenced on 13 August 2010 by her Honour Murrell DCJ on two unrelated offences of sexual intercourse without consent. Those sentences were never the subject of any appeal. The sentences are due to commence on 7 June 2018 and the non-parole period expires on 22 April 2022. They are as follows:

1. Sexual intercourse without consent: imprisonment for a fixed term of 2 years and 6 months to commence on 7 June 2018 and to expire on 6 December 2020.

2. Sexual intercourse without consent: imprisonment for 4 years, 10 months and 17 days to commence on 6 June 2019 and to expire on 22 April 2024 with a non-parole period of 2 years, 10 months and 17 days to expire on 22 April 2022.

4The parties have now approached the Court to make submissions in the light of the appellant's successful appeal to this Court and the quashing of his conviction. There has in those circumstances arisen a potential gap or hiatus between the present custodial status of the appellant and the date of commencement of the other sentences imposed in anticipation of his continuing unexpired non-parole period of the sentence for the murder.

5The parties have accordingly made a joint application, for consideration upon the papers, pursuant to s 59 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as follows:

""59 Court may vary commencement of sentence on quashing or varying other sentence 

(1) A court that quashes or varies a sentence of imprisonment imposed on a person (on appeal or otherwise) may vary the date of commencement of any other sentence that has been imposed on that person by that or any other court. 

(2) If a person is subject to two or more sentences, this section applies to each of them. 

(3) A court may vary a sentence under this section on its own initiative or on the application of a party to the proceedings on the quashing or variation of the other sentence. 

(4) An appeal does not lie merely because the date of commencement of a sentence is varied under this section. 

(5) The term of a sentence, or the non-parole period of a sentence, cannot be varied under this section.""

6The parties have submitted that this Court should vary the commencement date of the sexual intercourse without consent offences so that they are as follows:

1. Sexual intercourse without consent: imprisonment for a fixed term of 2 years and 6 months to commence on 4 December 2008 and to expire on 3 June 2011.

2. Sexual intercourse without consent: imprisonment for 4 years, 10 months and 17 days to commence on 4 December 2009 and to expire on 20 October 2014 with a non-parole period of 2 years, 10 months and 17 days to expire on 20 October 2012.

7It is clear that this Court is expressly not empowered to vary either the terms of these sentences or the respective non-parole periods: s 59(5). Even though this Court does have the power to intervene by imposing either a more or less severe sentence in substitution for a sentence in accordance with s 7(1) and (1A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, that power is limited to sentences arising out of a count or part of the indictment ""passed at the trial"". It does not extend to re-determining sentences arising out of other or different proceedings.

8It is not for this Court to speculate about the practical consequences that flow or that may flow from the orders made in this appeal on 20 May 2013. It is sufficient to observe, however, that there are different immediate and practical considerations that affect the appellant in his capacity as a prisoner on remand facing a new trial on the one hand, and those that apply to him as a prisoner serving a sentence on the other hand. The prompt ascertainment of his status is enough to warrant the making of the orders for which both parties now contend.

9In these circumstances the orders of the Court are as follows:

Vary the sentences imposed upon the appellant by her Honour Murrell DCJ on 13 August 2010 as follows:

(1) Sexual intercourse without consent: imprisonment for a fixed term of 2 years and 6 months to commence on 4 December 2008 and to expire on 3 June 2011.

(2) Sexual intercourse without consent: imprisonment for 4 years, 10 months and 17 days to commence on 4 December 2009 and to expire on 20 October 2014 with a non-parole period of 2 years, 10 months and 17 days to expire on 20 October 2012.

		10 April 2014",2013-06-10 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2706625,R v Jacobs [2013] NSWSC 942,"EX TEMPORE Judgment

1Before Court this morning I was handed the following note by the court officer from a juror:

""Dear Sir, 

I would like to request to be excused from this jury duty due to the following reasons:

(a) I have high blood pressure and high cholesterol and am currently under medication. 

After returning home, yesterday, I couldn't get much sleep due to my constant thought about the pressure involved in the court case. I am afraid it might affect my judgement and attention to my duty as a juror. My apologies to all concerned and without causing more inconvenience I hope, you will be able to excuse me from this jury duty"".

2The note became Jury Note 1.

3The background is that the jury was empanelled yesterday and sent home at about lunch time to permit resolution of legal issues before the Crown opening, which was proposed to occur this morning. The jury panel was given an estimate of the trial of five weeks, though that was for abundant caution and, realistically, I consider the trial should take no more than three weeks. Each member of the jury panel was requested at two separate stages of the empanelment process to consider whether he or she was capable of serving on the jury. Of course, I asked the jury panel to reflect upon the fact that the count in the indictment is murder and that the allegation against the accused is one of murder of a police officer. 

4Each counsel is of the view that the individual juror should be discharged and they are also of the view that, in all of the circumstances, it would be better to discharge the whole jury and start again by empanelling a fresh jury tomorrow morning. 

5As the decisions of Wu v The Queen [1999] HCA 52; (1999) 199 CLR 99 and R v Petroulias (No 33) [2007] NSWSC 1447 make clear, what is involved is a two step process. The first question is whether the individual juror should be discharged. 

6In truth, his or her problem seems to be one of stress about serving on a jury in this trial, rather than a medical issue. It is well known that high cholesterol and high blood pressure are conditions that very often can be controlled long term by medication. On the other hand, one or both of those conditions may be prone to exacerbation by stress. 

7Furthermore, I consider that it would be most undesirable to have a reluctant or distracted or distressed juror sitting on a trial as serious as this one. 

8It is also true that the trial, whilst not overly lengthy, can be contrasted with a three day trial of a simple issue. 

9It is also possible that the juror will, throughout the course of the trial, if not discharged, become more and more distressed, and state in due course that he or she is simply incapable of proceeding further.

10Finally the trial, in truth, has not yet begun, and it is not as if weeks of wasted time need to be weighed up against the position of the juror. 

11For all of these reasons I consider that, pursuant to s 53B (a) and (b )of the Jury Act 1977, the juror in question should be discharged. 

12I turn to the second and entirely separate question of whether the trial should continue with only 11 jurors. As I have said, each counsel has submitted that that is not a desirable course, and that the whole jury should be discharged and that we should empanel again tomorrow. 

13I consider that there is force in the submissions of counsel. Continuing a substantial trial with only eleven jurors, especially from a very early stage, is generally an undesirable course of action. The usual course is that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury of twelve. Separately, continuing with less than 12 jurors may also have indirect consequences with regard to, for example, s 22 and s 55F of the Jury Act. 

14I am told that a further jury can be empanelled tomorrow. I would have thought that today could be spent dealing with any legal issues that are able to be dealt with today, and also by the legal teams resolving issues informally between themselves to the benefit of the efficient running of the trial.

15As I have said the trial is at a very early stage and the position may be contrasted with, for example, the situation whereby a juror seeks to be discharged just before the jury, after weeks of evidence, retires to consider its verdict, and the second question as to whether the whole jury should be discharged is being considered at that stage.

16In all the circumstances, with regard to the second question, I propose to accede to the joint submission of the parties and discharge the whole jury and empanel a fresh jury tomorrow.

		16 July 2013",2013-06-11 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2706629,In the Application of S under section 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Proceedings) Act 1990 [2013] NSWLC 4,"Judgment

1The Applicant, S, stands charged with a number of counts of making false calls to an emergency service number contrary to section 474.18(1) of the Criminal Code Act (Cth) 1995 and counts of dishonestly obtaining a financial benefit by deception contrary to section 192E(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900. As yet, no pleas have been entered to the charges. I have already delivered a judgment concerning a suppression or non-publication order: see In the Application of S for a Supression or Non-Publication Order [2013] NSWLC 1.

2When the matters were last before the Court, Mrs Power, Solicitor for the Applicant, advised that it was intended to make an application pursuant to section 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Proceedings) Act 1990. That application was adjourned to 12 June 2013 to obtain any medical reports and a treatment plan.

3I have been provided, by agreement, with a comprehensive report of Professor Stephen Woods in advance of 12 June 2013. I was also provided with the Police Facts Sheet. It is common ground that there is no prior criminal history.

4The offence contrary to section 192E(1)(b) provides for a sentence of imprisonment for 10 years upon conviction on Indictment. The offence contrary to section 474.18(1) provides for a penalty of imprisonment for 3 years. The jurisdiction of the Local Court is confined to the imposition of individual sentences for 2 years but which can be cumulated up to 5 years. The penalties imposed by the respective Parliaments are an indication as to the objective seriousness of the offences, the relevance of which will be explained later in this judgment.

5Section 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Proceedings) Act 1990 provides as follows:-

(1)       If, at the commencement or at any time during the course of the hearing of proceedings before a Magistrate, it appears to the Magistrate: 
(a)   that the defendant is (or was at the time of the alleged commission of the offence to which the proceedings relate): 
(i)   developmentally disabled, or 
(ii)  suffering from mental illness, or 
(iii) suffering from a mental condition for which treatment is available in a mental health facility, 
but is not a mentally ill person, and 
(b)   that, on an outline of the facts alleged in the proceedings or such other evidence as the Magistrate may consider relevant, it would be more appropriate to deal with the defendant in accordance with the provisions of this Part than otherwise in accordance with law, 
the Magistrate may take the action set out in subsection (2) or (3).

(2)    The Magistrate may do any one or more of the following: 
(a)   adjourn the proceedings, 
(b)   grant the defendant bail in accordance with the Bail Act 1978, 
(c)   make any other order that the Magistrate considers appropriate.  
(3)    The Magistrate may make an order dismissing the charge and discharge the defendant: 
(a) into the care of a responsible person, unconditionally or subject to conditions, or 
(b) on the condition that the defendant attend on a person or at a place specified by the Magistrate for assessment of the defendant’s mental condition or treatment or both, or 
(c) unconditionally.
 
6A further relevant provision of the Act is contained in section 36 which provides that a Magistrate may inform himself or herself as the Magistrate thinks fit, but not so as to require a defendant to incriminate himself or herself. I refer here, of course, to the substantial report of Professor Woods.

7It will be convenient at this stage to look at the factual allegations in support of the charges. The Fact Sheet is part of the Court record so my own summary will suffice for present purposes. At the time of the alleged offences, the Applicant was a volunteer fire fighter with the New South Wales Rural Fire Service and commenced employment with the Fire and Rescue New South Wales in October 2012 as a Retained Fire Fighter.

8On 21 August 2012 the Applicant commenced contacting the Emergency Service Number 000 on something in the order of 18 occasions with a simless mobile telephone through to 20 December 2012. The services of Fire and Rescue were requested. Each call is allocated a call number and the calls are also recorded. The calls specified such incidents as a motor vehicle collision; grass fire; silo fire. As a result of these calls, a unit from the Rural Fire Service was deployed where it was discovered no incident or fire was located.

9The Applicant attended the sites as part of the call-out crews. For that attendance he was paid in accordance with his employment agreement with Fire and Rescue New South Wales. He was paid $350. A further total amount of $4,569 was paid to other members of the call-out crew attending the hoax calls. This figure takes no account of the costs of fuel and wear and tear to the equipment. 

10On 16 January 2013, he attended Young Police Station for an arranged interview. During the interview he was played a 000 call it was alleged he made on 11 January 2013. He admitted making this call; however, when played a number of further calls he denied making them. He was later placed under arrest and charged.

11That, in brief, is the factual background upon which the application under section 32 of the Act proceeds. The principal document relied upon In support of the application is the report of Professor Woods, Forensic Psychologist, dated 4 March 2013. Professor Woods advised both the Applicant and his parents that the report would be tendered in evidence and that any disclosures made would not enjoy any privilege of confidentiality. The report is now part of the Court record and commences with the following observations:-

In summary, assessment of [the Applicant] revealed him to be in many ways an emotionally immature young man of estimated low average intelligence and with corresponding level of executive functioning. Cognitive assessment carried out at age 8 years 9 months revealed 'mild intellectual disability'.

[The Applicant] appears to have developed his sense of self around the Rural Fire Service and to being something of a 'small town hero'. He also appears to have been given far greater responsibility than appropriate for a person of his age, intellect and emotional maturity.

Notwithstanding [the Applicant]'s assertion of having no memory of making the hoax calls (but accepting that he did make the calls) I am of opinion that the calls were made in order to have a greater level of active involvement in the Fire Service - particularly ' ... the excitement of riding in a fire truck with colleagues and assuming (or at least attempting to assume) a leadership role.' On the occasions that [the Applicant] was not able to be part of the response to the hoax calls (due to his employer not relieving him from work duties) he attended the Fire Station following the return of the response team - thus vicariously sharing in the excitement.

12The Applicant has been actively involved as a volunteer bush firefighter since the age of 16 years. Professor Woods noted numerous media clippings and the NSW Rural Fire Service Association newsletters attesting to that involvement including being a member of the winning Young Rural Fire Cadets team who were crowned State Champions in 2010 and being subsequently nominated through Young Shire Council for recognition at the Australia Day awards. Further, being a member of the successful South West Zone Rural Fire Service cadets' team taking out second place in the Australian National Fire Cadet Championships in 2011.

13His parents and younger brother continue to serve as volunteers in the NSW Rural Fire Service.

14The Applicant completed Year 10 in 2010 and currently attends TAFE as part of his Metal Fabricator/Welding apprenticeship. The report refers to a history of learning difficulties dating back to pre-school with learning difficulties receiving treatment from a Paediatric Occupational Therapist. At age 6 years he was assessed by a Speech Pathologist and an Educational Psychologist relating to delays in speech development and at age 8 years he was referred to a Behavioural Optometrist for assessment and treatment of impaired visual information processing. At the same age he was assessed by a psychologist, the results of psychometric testing indicating a mild intellectual disability. At age 11 years he was referred to a Paediatrician in relation to learning difficulties and hyperactivity, being diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and placed on Ritalin. 

15The Applicant told Professor Woods that he discontinued the medication after a period due to lack of improvement in his symptoms. His General Practitioner confirmed that the Applicant had not been on this medication for some years. The Doctor reported that while the medication appeared to provide significant improvement in the areas of impulsivity and distractibility, there was no obvious impact on the Applicant's learning difficulties. The parents told Professor Woods that the Applicant continued to struggle with his studies throughout high school and his TAFE courses. They further advised that he continues to require ""extra assistance"" in the completion of TAFE written assignments.

16Since leaving school, the Applicant has maintained a stable employment record with a local engineering company where he is employed as a third year Apprentice Metal Fabricator/Welder.

17On Mental Status examination he presented as a neatly groomed and polite young man who was co-operative with all aspects of the assessment. He was oriented to time, place and purpose of the assessment interview. No evidence of sensory, perceptual or cognitive impairment was detected. He did not exhibit or acknowledge having ever experienced symptoms of gross abnormal psychopathology. Similarly, he denied experiencing any symptoms even mildly suggestive of depression or undue levels of anxiety. Indeed, the report notes, a particularly noteworthy feature of his presentation was the reported absence of any areas of concern that one would tend to associate with circumstances of the type arising from criminal charges.

18Professor Woods administered a variety of tests including the Beck Anxiety Inventory and the Paulhus Deception Scale, the results of which were unremarkable. He assessed the Applicant as at low risk of re-offending and likely to require the lowest permissible level of supervision. The Applicant exhibits noteworthy characteristics of Avoidant Personality Disorder but not to the extent that he satisfies the strict diagnostic criteria of the Disorder. No evidence of a mental illness as defined in the Mental Health Act was found.

19Professor Woods concludes his report in the following way:-

[The Applicant] is not endowed with a high level of intelligence. Similarly, his levels of social maturity and executive function are felt to be (at best) in the low average range. [The Applicant]'s apparent lack of appreciation of the potential consequences of his actions at the material time and continued repression of memory of his actions are consistent with his estimated levels of cognitive and executive functioning. These behaviours are also consistent with features of Avoidant Personality Disorder.

[The Applicant] was raised in a family environment where service to the community is strongly valued. It was within this environment that he developed his sense of self and as a member of the volunteer Rural Fire Service was able to achieve respect from others. It would, however, appear that the levels of responsibility given to [the Applicant] in the absence of what his parents report to be appropriate leadership training was beyond his level of maturity.

The hoax telephone calls made by [the Applicant] appear to have been entirely motivated by the need to maintain a high level of involvement in an activity where he was able to perceive of himself as a capable person who helps others.

20Despite some setbacks as a child and at school, the Applicant is something of an achiever. He tried hard to emulate his family's involvement in the Rural Fire Service and with no small measure of success. He found schooling difficult but achieved his Year 10. He is in stable employment and making sound progress in his third year Apprenticeship - even if he does need a bit of help with written assignments. The important thing is that he is doing the best he can; he is keeping at it and he is getting there. He appears to function very well in the community and he deserves credit for that.

21I have to say I was concerned at a number of aspects where some form of blame for the Applicant's conduct was sought to be ascribed to others. Professor Woods does not seek to do this himself but obviously refers to what he was told by either the Defendant or his parents or both and I feel this may have had some bearing on his opinion. For example, the parents reported that they had been long concerned about the high levels of responsibility afforded to their son in both the NSW Rural Fire Service and subsequently the Fire and Rescue Service. I am not advised what asserted levels of ""high responsibility"" were actually reposed in a (then) 18 year old but if they were so concerned that he was not then mature enough to handle them - why did they ""ultimately acquiesce"" (whatever that may mean) to the recommendation of the Local Manager of the Rural Fire Service that the Applicant be accepted into the NSW Fire and Rescue Service. It occurs to me that he acquitted himself well and with enthusiasm from cadet level onwards and created a favourable impression on management. It also occurs to me that he was pleased with what he achieved and that his parents were proud of him accordingly. If there really was any real parental doubt, why ""ultimately acquiesce""?

22Next, there was reference to the Applicant being a front-line responder and being responsible for the care of a victim with serious injuries. Both the Applicant and his parents told Professor Woods that no post-trauma incident briefing was offered or even suggested. I am not advised whether any was required or even requested. Nor am I advised as to the relevance of this to the present Application. If there really was any identifiable adverse reaction to this experience, I would have thought it would be enough to give the Rural Fire Service away rather than embracing it as he continued to do - even to the point of obsession.

23It needs to be made clear to the Applicant that he is not a victim in this matter. And others should not seek to portray him as such.

24I now turn to the task prescribed by section 32 of the Act.

25The offences involving fraud upon the Fire Service plus making false calls to an emergency number must be viewed as objectively serious crimes indeed and, in the ordinary course of events, call for condign punishment. The objective seriousness of an offence is assessed by reference to the elements of the offence and statutory maximum. The statutory maximum penalty acts as a ""benchmark or reference point"": R v Way [2004] 60 NSWLR 168.

26Over the years, Courts have recognised several factors that bear generally upon the objective seriousness of a given offence including the offences here in question. The interplay of these factors help to place the offence on the spectrum of like offences. The following features have been identified as influencing the assessment of the gravity of the crime:-

(1)The amount of money involved (R v Hawkins (1989) 45 A Crim R 430; R v Mungomery (2004) 151 A Crim R 376 at [40]; R v Woodman [2001] NSWCCA 310, R v Finnie [2002] NSWCCA 533 at [59]) and whether the loss is irretrievable: R v Todorovic [2008] NSWCCA 49 at [19].

27It has to be said that here the amount of money flowing to the Applicant was not large; however, in R v Finnie [2002] NSWCCA 533 it was held that although the amount of money defrauded is not determinative of the seriousness of the offence, ""it is relevant to a degree and particularly where the offences are premeditated, committed on a number of separate occasions and involve a degree of planning"".

(2)The length of time over which the offences are committed: R v Pont (2000) 121 A Crim R 302 at [74], [75], R v Mungomery (2004) 151 A Crim R 376 at [40]. 

28Here, the offending was over a 4-month period. This is relevant to indicate the degree of planning and to show it was not an impulsive offence: see R v Mears (1991) 53 A Crim R 141 @ 145; R v Murtaza [2001] NSWCCA 336.

(3)The motive for the crime: R v Mears (1991) 53 A Crim R 141 at 145, R v Hill [2004] NSWCCA 257 at [6], R v Woodman [2001] NSWCCA 310 at [29]. 

29I do not believe that money was the real motivation for the Applicant's actions, rather, it was to alleviate boredom in a life which had no interests or organised activity other than his association with the Fire Service (see Report of Professor Woods, Par 1.2, p 6).

(4)The degree of planning and sophistication: R v Mille (unreported, NSWCCA, 1/5/98), R v Pont (2000) 121 A Crim R 302 at [43]-[44], R v Murtaza [2001] NSWCCA 336 at [15], Stevens v R [2009] NSWCCA 260 at [59], [78].

30This is relevant to the question of whether the offences were part of an organised or planned activity which is an aggravating factor to be taken into account under section 21A(2)(n) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

(5)An accompanying breach of trust: R v El-Rashid (unreported, NSWCCA, 7/4/95), R v Pont (2000) 121 A Crim R 302, R v Hawkins (1989) 45 A Crim R 430.

31Offences of this nature are difficult to detect and go to the very heart of the relationship between employer and employee/volunteer in an emergency service setting. See also R v McLean (unreported, NSWCCA, 31/3/1989). The courts have also had regard to the impact on public confidence: R v Pont (2000) 121 A Crim R 302 at [74], [75]. To that one adds the real possibility of danger to life and property when crews are diverted from attending at genuine incidents because of hoax calls.

32The purpose of referring to these authorities is to reflect the objective seriousness of the offending conduct in matters such as the present, which is a requirement for consideration in conformity with such cases as Perry v Forbes (unreported, Supreme Court of NSW, 21/5/1993) at [48] of the judgment; Confos v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2004] NSWSC 1159 at [17]; by Spigelman CJ in Director of Public Prosecutions v El Mawas [2006] NSWCA 154 at [17]; by McColl JA in the same case at [77]; by Adams J in Mantell v Molyneux [2006] NSWSC 955; (2006) 165 A Crim R 83 at [40]; and by Hall J in Khalil v His Honour, Magistrate Johnson [2008] NSWSC 1092 at [85(7)]: see also Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Soliman [2013] NSWSC 346 per Button J, at [59].

33In Confos v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW), Howie J observed at [17]- 

In order to determine whether it is more appropriate to deal with the applicant under Part 3 the Magistrate has to perform a balancing exercise; weighing up, on one hand, the purposes of punishment and, on the other, the public interest in diverting the mentally disordered offender from the criminal justice system. It is a discretionary judgment upon which reasonable minds may reach different conclusions in any particular case. But it is one that cannot be exercised properly without due regard being paid to the seriousness of the offending conduct for which the defendant is before the court. Clearly the more serious the offending, the more important will be the public interest in punishment being imposed for the protection of the community and the less likely will it be appropriate to deal with the defendant in accordance with the provisions of the Act. It should be emphasised that what is being balanced is two public interests, to some extent pulling in two different directions.

It is not a matter of weighing the public interest in punishment as against the private interest of the defendant in rehabilitation.

34The correctness of his Honour's decision was confirmed in Director of Public Prosecutions v El Mawas - see, in particular, the leading judgment of Justice McColl with whom Spigelman CJ and Handley JA agreed. His Honour the Chief Justice added (at [17]) that the seriousness of the alleged offence is always a matter entitled to weight in formulating the judgment for which section 32 calls.

35Mr Dalzell of Counsel, in the course of his helpful submissions, referred me to the report of Professor Woods, in particular the observations of mild intellectual disability, emotional immaturity, a low level of intelligence and learning difficulties. He posed the question, ""Who in his right mind would do this?"" but motivations can be many and still not linked to the kind of developmental disability or mental illness contemplated by the legislation. He submitted that the very symptomology described by Professor Woods would best be addressed by the Applicant complying with the Treatment Plan and accompanying letter from Ms McAllister, a local Psychologist and he urged me to grant the Application.

36Sergeant Middleton submitted that the report does not go so far as to establish the pre-requisites in section 32(1)(a) of the Act but, even if it did (and without conceding it), he further submits that the objective seriousness of the charges would militate against the exercise of the judicial discretion called for and that the matters ought be dealt with according to law.

37In my view, on the totality of the evidence before the Court, the Applicant is not suffering from a developmental disability within the meaning and contemplation of section 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Proceedings) Act 1990. The history reveals at most a ""mild intellectual disability"" from a young age persisting to an extent and while he exhibits characteristics of Avoidant Personality Disorder, Professor Woods says he does not satisfy the strict diagnostic criteria of the Disorder. In any event, this all arises after the events in question. Nor has it been shown he is suffering from a mental illness or a mental condition for which treatment is available in a hospital. That should be enough to dispose of the Application; however, even if reasonable minds should reasonably differ with my conclusion, I also take the view that the seriousness of the offences and of the offending is such that the charges should be dealt with according to law rather than under the Mental Health legislation. On either view, it follows that the Application must be dismissed.

		28 June 2013",2013-06-11 00:00:00,NSW Local Court
2706633,Semaan v Poidevin (No 2) [2013] NSWSC 694,"Judgment

1On 22 March 2013, the Court issued the principal judgment (hereinafter, ""the principal judgment"" or, in the case of the reasons, ""the first reasons""). On 3 April 2013, the parties were notified by email that the reasons for judgment, which had been published by the Court, did not take into account the final amendments to the reasons, the inclusion of which amendments better expressed the original intention of the Court. 

2Additions were made to paragraphs [76], [77] and [110] of the judgment of 22 March 2013, and amended reasons for judgment (hereinafter, ""the amended reasons"") were attached to the aforementioned correspondence. No variation was made to the orders of Court that were made on 22 March 2013. 

3The parties were invited to provide the Court with written submissions regarding any aspect of the amendment of the reasons for judgment. Neither party raised objection to the amendment on the basis of the correspondence. The amended reasons were published by the Court on 5 April 2013.

4It is necessary to state that the proceedings concerned an appeal against conviction in the Local Court of New South Wales. On 4 April 2012 in the Local Court, Mr Semaan was found guilty of resisting a police officer in the execution of duty, contrary to s 546C of the Crimes Act 1900. On 22 March 2013, this Court, as presently constituted, ordered that: (1) the order made by the Local Court of New South Wales convicting Mr Semaan of the offence of resist a police officer in the execution of his or her duty be set aside; and, (2) the charge against Mr Semaan, being that on 14 September 2011 at Auburn, he did resist Sergeant Poidevin, a member of the Police Force in the execution of his duty, be dismissed. It is unnecessary to recite in detail the facts and circumstances of the conduct giving rise to proceedings. They are described fully in the amended reasons (and in the first reasons).

Consideration

5As stated by the Court in its reasons, this was a conviction appeal pursuant to the provisions of s 52 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. The application of the provisions of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (hereinafter, ""UCPR"") to such an appeal is an issue to which the Court's attention has been drawn by the Crown Solicitor, notwithstanding that the Crown did not object to the content of the amendments. 

6It is not immediately apparent why the Crown has raised the application of the UCPR.

7If the UCPR were applicable to these proceedings, an amendment to the judgment could be effected pursuant to Part 36 Division 4. Under the UCPR, a judgment is taken to have been entered when it has been recorded in the court's computerised court record system: r 36.11. Rule 35.15(2) provides that a judgment or order of the Court in any proceedings may be set aside by order of the court if the parties to the proceedings consent. Rule 16.16(3)(a) provides that the court may set aside or vary any judgment or order except so far as it determines any claim for relief, or determines any question (whether of fact or law or both) arising on any claim for relief. Further, the UCPR provides that, within 14 days of a judgment or order having been entered, the court may, of its own motion, set aside or vary the judgment or order as if the judgment or order had not been entered: r 16.16(3B).

8Whatever be the position at common law, the definitions contained within the Civil Procedure Act 2005 preclude the application of the UCPR to an appeal from conviction in the Local Court. On that basis, it was suggested that the provisions of Part 36 Division 4 of the UCPR do not provide for the variation of the judgment handed down by the Court in this matter.

9Section 3 of the Civil Procedure Act defines ""criminal proceedings"" to include ""proceedings on an appeal against conviction or sentence"". ""[C]ivil proceedings"" are defined by the section as ""any proceedings other than criminal proceedings"". Pursuant to r 1.5 UCPR, with reference to Schedule 1, the UCPR apply to ""[a]ll civil proceedings"" in the Supreme Court of New South Wales. Assuming, therefore, that an appeal on conviction to this Court from the Local Court of New South Wales is a criminal proceeding as defined by the Civil Procedure Act, such proceedings are not subject to the UCPR and the variation of orders of the Court in those proceedings are not governed by UCPR Part 36. These rules may be necessary because the rules apply to civil proceedings in courts other than this Court, which has inherent power and jurisdiction. 

10However, the amendment effected is not an amendment to a judgment. It is an amendment to the wording of the reasons for judgment. Nevertheless I will deal with the issue, because it informs the process. 

11The power of the Court to vary an order already entered (and reasons for judgment) was considered at length by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Glyn Morgan JONES; R v Anthony Joseph Luis HILI (No 2) [2010] NSWCCA 195 (""Jones & Hili (No 2)""). In that case, the amendment was required of a statement or wording in the reasons for judgment. The Court there discussed the status of the Court of Criminal Appeal as the Supreme Court when exercising the jurisdiction confirmed by the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. After analysis of the powers of the Court of Criminal Appeal deriving from its status, it was held that the Court of Criminal Appeal is the Supreme Court for the purposes of exercising the jurisdiction under the Criminal Appeal Act and, therefore, a superior court of record. 

12As stated earlier, in Jones & Hili (No 2), as in the proceedings presently before the Court, the Court dealt with the power to correct reasons for judgment. The Court said:

""[27] Reasons for judgment are not the judgment of the Court. The foregoing is trite. 

[28] The judgment of a court is entered and forms part of the record of the proceedings and, at common law and absent statutory expansion, forms the basis for certain prerogative writs: see Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58; (1995) 184 CLR 163.

[29] Reasons for judgment do not ordinarily form part of the record of the court: Craig, supra; but, for the purpose of the issue of orders in the nature of certiorari, s 69 of the Supreme Court Act now renders reasons for judgment part of the record.

[30] At least in part, for that reason, or derived in part from the principles that give rise to that reason, significant restrictions are imposed upon the jurisdiction of a superior court to alter judgments, once entered. 

[31] As stated in Grierson v The King [1938] HCA 45; (1938) 60 CLR 431 at 436, Dixon J commented:

'The determination of an appeal is evidently definitive, and a conviction unappealed is equally final. No considerations controlling or affecting the conclusion to be deduced from these provisions are supplied by analogous civil proceedings.'

His Honour was there referring to the effect of the Act. 

[32] Likewise in the joint judgment of Dawson and Gaudron JJ in Postiglione v R [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 300, their Honours said:

'If a final order was made perfecting the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal on Postiglione's first application, the assumption of jurisdiction to entertain his second application and the ensuing appeal was contrary to the decision of this Court in Grierson v The King [1938] HCA 45; (1938) 60 CLR 431. It was held in that case that the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) does not confer jurisdiction to reopen an appeal which has been heard on the merits and finally determined. A fortiori, in a case where what is involved is the hearing of a second appeal. Pantorno does not suggest otherwise. The view was expressed in Pantorno that an intermediate court of appeal can entertain an application to remedy a denial of procedural fairness whether or not its order has been perfected (Pantorno v The Queen [1989] HCA 18; (1989) 166 CLR 466 at 474 per Mason CJ and Brennan J, 484 per Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ.)'

The foregoing approach was also adopted or accepted by McHugh J (at 315) and by Gummow J (at 327) in Postiglione, supra. 

[33] Thus, there are two quite distinct periods, each of which determines the ability to alter judgments or orders. Prior to the judgment being entered, the circumstances in which a court will be persuaded to entertain further argument (and possibly further evidence) are extremely limited. In relation to such earlier period, the High Court, in Elliott & Blessington applied the civil criteria expressed by the Court in Autodesk Inc v Dyason (No. 2) [1993] HCA 6; (1993) 176 CLR 300 which said, at 303:

'What must emerge, in order to enliven the exercise of the jurisdiction, is that the Court has apparently proceeded according to some misapprehension of the facts or the relevant law and that this misapprehension cannot be attributed solely to the neglect or default of the party seeking the rehearing. The purpose of the jurisdiction is not to provide a backdoor method by which unsuccessful litigants can seek to re-argue their cases.'

[34] On the other hand, after judgment has been entered there are only three bases upon which a judgment or order may be reopened and amended and they are:

(a) the 'slip' rule;

(b) the power to amend the rule (sic - order) where the intention of the Court has not manifested in the judgment; and

(c) the capacity to allow the opening of orders made in chambers: see Bailey v Marinoff [1971] HCA 49; (1971) 125 CLR 529; DJL, supra, CH Giles & Co v Morris (1972) 1 All ER 1960.""

13In the circumstances of this case, it is open to the Court to alter the reasons for judgment (at [76], [77] and [110]), at least if those alterations were effected on one of the three bases described in [34] of Jones & Hili (No 2). The exact circumstances in which the final amendments were not included in the judgment published on 22 March 2013 matter not. The intention of the Court was more clearly expressed by the inclusion of the final amendments, which were published on 5 April 2013. As a consequence of their omission, ""the intention of the Court has not manifested in the judgment"": see Jones & Hili (No 2), at [34(b)]. 

14As was pointed out in Jones & Hili (No 2), the proposition that a superior court of record has no power to alter a judgment or reasons for judgment cannot withstand scrutiny. Further, the power to alter reasons for judgment must at least be as wide as the power to alter the judgment itself. 

15Moreover, an alteration to correct an infelicitous or ambiguous expression may alter the wording of the reasons, but not the reasons: see Jones & Hili (No 2) at [39]-[40].

16The Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Victoria (Charles, Chernov and Vincent JJA) in Fletcher Construction Australia Ltd v Lines MacFarlane Marshall Pty Ltd [2001] VSCA 167; (2001) 4 VR 28 dealt with the capacity of judicial officers to alter reasons for judgment. The Court said:

""[49] The extent to which judges of a superior court may properly alter reasons for judgment subsequent to their being given may depend not only on whether the changes are sought to be made before or after judgment has been entered, but also on the nature and extent of the alterations. A litigant is entitled to a decision that is based on reasons that have led the judge to that conclusion. It would obviously impede the proper administration of justice and work unfairness to the parties if the judge could, at a later time, give different reasons for the decision which were crafted after judgment had been pronounced. Thus, the courts limit the rights of a judge to change the reasons, but they do so consistently with the practical requirements of justice. In the case of a superior court of record, judgment is not relevantly finalised until it is entered in the records of the court. Hence, until that occurs, the judge can recall the order and the reasons and make a different order and give different reasons - Smith v. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd; Sherpa v. Anderson; Mulvena; Re Harrison's Shares Under a Settlement. But once judgment is perfected the judge cannot, in substance, re-write the given reasons so as to give different reasons for the decision or, in the words of Willmer, L.J. in Bromley v. Bromley (No.2), 'put a different complexion on the issue in dispute'. In Nakhla v. McCarthy Woodhouse, J. said that in general a judge cannot alter the reasons so as to modify or change the effect of the judgment once it has been perfected. Similarly, in Bank of Nova Scotia v. Province of Nova Scotia, the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal held that once judgment is entered, the substance of the reasons cannot be changed; if correction is needed it can only be made by a higher court. 

[50] An example of a case where it was held that the judicial officer had impermissibly changed the reasons for the decision is Lam v. Beesley. In that case, the magistrate announced the verdict and convicted the defendant for reasons which he gave orally. He then sentenced him and subsequently published 'Reasons for Decision' in which he made a finding of fact that was inconsistent with his earlier finding as expressed in his ex tempore reasons. On appeal, Owen, J. held that the two findings could not stand together and that, in the circumstances, the magistrate was not entitled later to formulate reasons which were, in substance, different from those which had been pronounced. His Honour held that, in the circumstances, the conviction could not stand. More recently, in Todorovic v. Moussa leave to appeal from the decision of the District Court was granted by the New South Wales Court of Appeal seemingly for the reason that after delivery of an oral judgment the District Court judge inserted in his corrected judgment an additional sentence, namely, 'I do not accept [X] as an accurate witness'. It would appear that there was no other reference in the reasons to the acceptability or otherwise of X's evidence which in fact was corroborated by other evidence. Furthermore, it was at least arguable that the addition of a broad statement that was unconnected with the rest of the reasons, namely, that the judge did not accept the witness, went beyond what could be done when revising an oral judgment. 

[51] It seems, however, that ordinarily, even after judgment has been entered, it is permissible to change the given reasons provided that in substance they do not become different reasons as a result of the changes and provided the alterations are made within a period that is not unduly long in all the circumstances. Thus, it is clear enough, for example, that a judge can alter the transcript of the reasons at any time to remove an error brought about by an administrative act which related to the compiling of the reasons - Nakhla; Bromley. In Bar-Mordecai v. Rotman it was held that ex tempore reasons can be altered by a judge provided the substance of them is not changed, nor are the orders which they sustain. There is no reason in principle why a like position should not apply to written judgments that have been published. It is common practice for judges to make changes not only to reasons that have been given ex tempore, but also to written reasons and in the latter case to make changes to them between the time they are published and when they become the subject of an authorised report. For example, in Duke of Buccleuch v. Inland Revenue Commissioners Lord Reid and Lord Guest did not question the correctness of the action of Sankey, J. in deleting in the version that was later published in the Law Reports a paragraph of his reasons in Ellesmere (Earl of) v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, which had been published in the Law Times. In fact, Lord Reid considered that Sankey, J. was wise to have deleted that paragraph, given that his Honour must have had a reservation about its correctness."" (Citations omitted.)

17Even if I were of a different view to the Victorian Court of Appeal, I do not consider that the foregoing is plainly wrong: Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 22; (2007) 230 CLR 89. However, I consider the foregoing is the correct analysis, and plainly so. Comments in Grierson v The King [1938] HCA 45; (1938) 60 CLR 431, Elliott v The Queen; Blessington v The Queen [2007] HCA 51; (2007) 234 CLR 38 and Burrell v The Queen [2008] HCA 34; (2008) 238 CLR 218 do not qualify the foregoing. Rather, each deals, in one form or another, with an attempt to add reasons (e.g. to deal with an argument, or different facts, not previously dealt with), to alter the reasons for similar reasons, or to reopen the appeal to deal with issues of that kind: see the analysis in Jones & Hili (No 2) at [44]-[48].

18The alteration effected on 5 April 2013 to the published reasons in this matter was not an attempt to re-open the appeal. Nor was it an alteration to the rationale of the judgment, or otherwise inconsistent with the first reasons. Rather it was the clarification of an infelicitous expression that should have effected prior to the initial publication.

19It is for the foregoing reasons that the Court effected the alteration to the wording and was not troubled by the issue raised by the defendant herein. I add only that it was most appropriate, and appreciated, that the issue was raised and I commend the Crown Solicitor for so doing.

		04 June 2013",2013-06-02 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2706661,R v Peter KOKLA [2013] NSWDC 209,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE

1I am sentencing a 43 year old man who had no significant criminal convictions at all until a year or so ago. However those convictions - which were for drug offences - pointed to what was going on in his life. His life was spiralling out of control because of a very serious drug addiction problem. Then what happened is that the police found him with significant amounts of different drugs in his possession and he ended up being charged with a very serious drug offence and with other related drug offences. I have to now sentence him and both the defence and the prosecution agree that I have no other choice but to send him to prison. Indeed on Friday, when I heard the matter, I refused his application for bail. 

2I will first outline the charges which the man, whose name is Peter Kokla, faces, then I will say something about the circumstances of the offence, what happened and what the police found. I will then refer to matters which are personal to Peter Kokla because a judge has to take into account not only the seriousness of the crime that the judge is sentencing the offender for but also personal matters. I will then review the arguments by the prosecution and the defence and sentence Mr Kokla.

3I am sentencing him for three offences. 

4The most serious is supplying a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug. The prohibited drug is known colloquially as nexus or bromo. Mr Kokla pleaded guilty to that charge at what the prosecution agrees was the earliest available opportunity. It was on 28 August 2012. In due course I will discount that sentence by 25 per cent in acknowledgement of that plea of guilty. That crime is an offence against s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. Parliament regards the crime as so serious that it has fixed a maximum of 20 years imprisonment to the offence. Not only that Parliament has fixed a standard non-parole period of 10 years to that offence. 

5The second offence that I am sentencing Mr Kokla for is an offence called possessing a prohibited drug. He had nine tablets of a drug colloquially known as MDA in his possession. That is an offence against s 10(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act and carries a maximum of 2 years imprisonment. Mr Kokla pleaded guilty to that offence also, but he did not plead guilty until the day of his trial. In due course it is agreed, because that offence is relatively far less serious than the other two offences I am sentencing him for, that I can dispose of that by recording a conviction only.

6The third offence is supplying a prohibited drug. The drug is colloquially known as GBL and is an offence against s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. Parliament has fixed a maximum of 15 years imprisonment to that offence as well. Again Mr Kokla did not plead guilty to that offence until the day of his trial and in due course I will discount that sentence by about 5 per cent to represent the late plea. Mr Kokla spent 3 days in custody after he was arrested and, as I said, I refused him bail on Friday. That was 31 May 2013, so the sentences which I would impose will date from last Tuesday, 28 May 2013.

7I will now say something briefly about how these charges came about. On Tuesday 20 March 2012 a couple of police were patrolling the suburb of Waterloo. They were in an unmarked car. It was the middle of the afternoon. They saw a Land Rover illegally parked. Mr Kokla was in the Land Rover and the police took some time to watch what he was doing. They walked towards the car and noticed that he was using a mobile phone. They pointed out that he was parked illegally. He said that he was waiting for a friend. They asked him for his identification. They noticed that his mobile phone was ringing constantly. They asked him to get out of the car. He was behaving suspiciously so far as they were concerned. Their suspicion went further than the fact that he was parked illegally. 

8They said they were going to search the car and he said that there was nothing that they should be concerned about. They found a backpack in the car and in the backpack they found what is described as a waist bag. Mr Kokla told them that there was a syringe in the waist bag. Then one of the police opened up the waist bag and found that it contained some coloured capsules and a Xanax bottle which contained tablets and it also contained a resealable plastic bag with some crystaline substance inside it. At that point the police told Mr Kokla that he was under arrest. He protested and asked them to give him a break because it was for his personal use. He acknowledged that he had some ice on him. When the police asked him about the syringe he said ""I use it for my G"". ""G"" was a reference to an illegal drug commonly referred to as GHB.

9There was a bottle containing some gluggy fluid and Mr Kokla said it was water. The police found over $800 in cash and they also found two mobile phones. At this stage Mr Kokla, having been arrested, was taken by the police to Redfern Police Station and a more thorough search was conducted of the backpack as well as the waist bag. Police had a lot to find in those two bags. So much did they find that later that afternoon Mr Kokla found himself charged with a large number of drug offences. I should say briefly what they are. 

10When they looked in the backpack the police found a drink bottle which contained clear fluid. That turned out to be a prohibited drug called Gamma Butyrolactone, commonly referred to as GBL. That resulted in the charge which I am sentencing Mr Kokla for of supplying a prohibited drug. In the backpack they also found a plastic container with some pink fluid in it. That was later found to contain 12 grams of the prohibited drug called 1,4-Butanediol. 

11They also found some syringes without needles and some empty plastic fish-shaped containers. The facts which were agreed between the prosecution and the defence and which were part of exhibit A said that this ""type of container is commonly used to store street-deal sized amounts of GHB"". Police then looked into the waist bag. They found a plastic container labelled Xanax that contained 38 tablets. They were later found to be the medication Xanax. That contains a proscribed restricted substance which is called Alprazolam. 

12That find resulted in a charge of possessing a proscribed restricted substance which is an offence against s 16(1) of the Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act 1966. Mr Kokla has asked me to take that into account when I am sentencing him for the supply of the prohibited drug. I should have added that a container of 1,4-Butanediol also resulted in a charge of possessing a prohibited drug, an offence against s 10(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. In due course I will take those two matters into account when I am sentencing Mr Kokla for the supply of a prohibited drug. 

HIS HONOUR: I will just depart from my remarks on sentence there, Mr Laird, Mr Hajje I have got a Form 1 which is unsigned which is attached to a copy of the indictment MFI 1. Do I have the original here somewhere?
LAIRD: It was attached to the indictment in the registry file on Friday.
HAJJE: If it's missing I can rectify.
HIS HONOUR: It is just where Mr Laird said it would be. 

13I will take those two matters into account, along with a number of other matters which I will refer to in the course of my reasons, and I sign a document to that effect.

14Returning to the search of the waist bag, police found a blister packet labelled Ritalin containing five tablets. That find resulted in a charge of possessing a prescribed restricted substance, namely Ritalin which was also an offence against s 16(1) of the Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act. In the waist bag police also found two loose white tablets. They were later analysed and found to be the prescribed restricted substance methylphenidate which is a component of Ritalin. That and the five tablets which I have just referred to were both made the subject of the same charge and I will take that charge into account when I am sentencing Mr Kokla on the supply of a prohibited drug.

15Police continued their search and found a plastic resealable bag. It contained three capsules; they were later analysed and found to be a prohibited drug, 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine or MDA. In another part of the waist bag they found another resealable bag which contained six capsules which turned out to be the same substance which is referred to as MDA. 

16As a result of finding those nine tablets police charged Mr Kokla with the offence of possessing a prohibited drug which is one of the matters that I am sentencing him for. In another section of the waist bag police found a blister packet labelled Aurogra and six tablets. The facts note that Aurogra is more commonly known as Viagra. That resulted in a charge of possessing a prescribed restricted substance contrary to s 16(1) of the Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act and I will take that into account when I am sentencing Mr Kokla for the offence of supplying a prohibited drug.

17Continuing their search, police found 5 plastic resealable bags. Each bag contained a white coloured crystaline substance. These bags were later analysed. Two of the bags were found to contain just over a gram of Ketamine, a prohibited drug. Three of the bags were found to contain just under half a gram of methylamphetamine which is also a prohibited drug. Police charged Mr Kokla with possessing a prohibited drug in respect of the first two bags and possessing a prohibited drug in respect of the three bags. I will take those two offences into account when I am sentencing him for supplying a prohibited drug.

18A further search of the waist bag produced a number of resealable plastic bags. Two of those each contained 100 beige coloured tablets with the logo X. These were later analysed and found to be a total of 42.54 grams of a prohibited drug. The prohibited drug is 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine commonly known as nexus or bromo. That resulted in the charge of supplying a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug which I am sentencing Mr Kokla for.

19Continuing their search, police found two small glass bottles. Each had a clear fluid in it. Those were later analysed and found to contain 42 grams of another prohibited drug. This one was gamma butyrolactone, commonly know as GBL. That resulted in the charge of supplying a prohibited drug which I will be sentencing Mr Kokla for and in respect of which I will be taking the other matters into account which I have referred to.

20The last item found was another plastic resealable bag containing a white crystaline substance which turned out on analysis to be just over 0.2 grams of yet another prohibited drug. This time is was 3,4-methylenedioxymethylamphetamine, more commonly known as MDMA or ecstasy. That resulted in a charge of possessing a prohibited drug contrary to s 10(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. 

21In addition police found a set of digital scales in the waist bag. Police estimated that the value of the GBL which resulted in the charge of supplying a prohibited drug would be $2,100 on the street and the value on the street of the drug commonly known as nexus or bromo would be $5,000.

22I turn now to consider matters personal to Mr Kokla. As I said, he is 43. The very first matter on his criminal record did not appear until 2006. That was a low range breathalyser offence. Indeed he received a good behaviour bond under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and I do not take it into account. Then he was arrested on Christmas Day 2011 and charged with a series of drug offences. He was arrested apparently because he was driving and behaving suspiciously. As it turned out he was driving under the influence of drugs. Once he was arrested he was referred to what is called the Magistrates' Early Referral Into Treatment or MERIT program. He received a good report in respect of that program. That report became exhibit 2 and was dated 17 July 2012.

23When Mr Kokla came before the Local Court sitting in the Downing Centre on 7 February this year charged with the offences arising out of that episode he received two community service orders and a couple of fines.

24However it will be obvious, when one looks at the dates, that within three or four months of being arrested on Christmas Day 2011 he was arrested for the offences that I am sentencing him for. It therefore becomes apparent that he committed these offences while he was on bail and attempting to undertake the MERIT program. I also need to take into account the fact that he now has on his criminal record other drug offences, including one being a drug supply offence.

25Mr A Williams of counsel who appeared for Mr Kokla tendered a report by the forensic psychologist Mr W John Taylor. Mr Taylor reported some personal information about Mr Kokla. He was apparently married when he was aged 23. He has a daughter and a son. The daughter is now around 19 or 20 and the son is in his mid-teens. There was an early separation but then they resumed the relationship but the marriage finally ended after about 9 years.

26Mr Taylor noted a history of steady employment involving mechanical work and driving. It is apparent that Mr Kokla changed employment fairly regularly but stayed in some jobs for a number of years. He apparently began to smoke cannabis in his late teenage years. Then Mr Taylor records that at ""the age of 35 years he began to take ecstasy about once every couple of weeks when he was going to clubs."" Mr Taylor, who wrote his report on 9 August 2012, then noted that Mr Kokla ""started to smoke 'ice' about 18 months ago. He said that this was only on an occasional basis initially but that it quickly built up to being a daily habit. He continued to smoke it daily for about 6 months until he was arrested."" This seems to be the change in his drug taking behaviour which resulted in the predicament that he now finds himself in. He even found himself gambling excessively when he was taking the drug commonly known as Ice. 

27Mr Taylor diagnosed him with a drug abuse disorder with indications of some instability in his personality adjustment. He thought that some tests indicated that Mr Kokla ""has an above-average predisposition to engage in substance abuse."" Mr Taylor thought that actuarial analysis indicated that Mr Kokla ""has a low-moderate to moderate to moderate risk of recidivism."" Mr Taylor noted that Mr Kokla claimed to be motivated to remain drug free. Mr Taylor thought that his prospects for rehabilitation were quite good. 

28However, since then there has been another assessment by the Probation and Parole Service. They produced a pre-sentence report which was dated 27 March 2013. That indicated that Mr Kokla was still using prohibited drugs, including MDMA and MDA, during his time period of their assessment. They found that out because of drug screening which they are required to undertake. The report concluded as follows - 

""The offender reported as directed however his resolve to cease his abuse of drugs appears to only have occurred as a result of the pending court matters. This is evidenced by urinalysis results. While results of the drug screens show a clear reduction in the offender's abuse of illicit substances, his commitment to reducing and eventually ceasing substance abuse is yet to be tested."" 

29They regarded him as suitable for a low to medium level of intervention from that service.

30I therefore have to discount Mr Taylor's assessment of Mr Kokla's likelihood of recovery and his rehabilitation because of his more recent continuing in the use of illicit drugs. He does indeed appear to be truly a drug addict who has not as yet dealt with his addiction. 

31There is a short report from a clinical psychologist noting that he had attended some sessions in early 2003. It contains no further comment. There is a letter from Mr Kokla acknowledging the seriousness of the crime and accepting full responsibility for his actions. He expressed his shame and remorse. There are some references from a friend and an employer or business partner and a parish priest which point to him being a caring and reliable person and a good employee and coming from a good family. 

32Mr D Laird, who appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions, acknowledged that the possess a prohibited drug could be dealt with under s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act because of its relative status compared with the other far more serious offences. In due course I will do that. He also acknowledged that the sentence for the supplying of a prohibited drug could be concurrent with the sentence for the supplying of a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug. He reminded me that Mr Kokla had been on bail for other drug offences and I take that into account. It is a significant circumstance. 

33Mr Laird acknowledged that there are special circumstances for adjusting the normal relationship between a non-parole period and the main sentence. Mr Williams said that there was no evidence of actual supply. That is true to a limited extent in that Mr Kokla was not seen to pass on drugs to another person; but I note that his phone was ringing constantly, he had large amounts of prohibited drugs with him (which is why he has been charged with offences of deemed supply) and he had plastic bags as well as the fish shaped cylinders and a set of scales. I have no doubt that he was actually trading in drugs. 

34Mr Williams pointed out that the street value of $5000 in respect of the commercial quantity was a relatively low amount for commercial quantities. I think he has a point there. Profits, as he said, can be much higher from these enterprises. He pointed out that the purity at three per cent was relatively low. So Mr Williams argued that the commercial supply was towards the lower end of commercial supply cases and I accept that submission. He pointed out that the supply drug offence was closer to the indictable quantity and far from the commercial quantity and again towards the lower end with a relatively low street value of just $2000 and I accept that. 

35Mr Williams classified his client as a user/dealer at a low level, not in it for making money and it illustrated the extent of his addiction. Accepting that submission as I do, of course it does not reduce the culpability of his client for the activity he was engaged in; it simply explains his motivation.

36I do take into account that his criminal record contained no other serious matters apart from the drug offences which he was convicted of earlier this year. I accept so far as profit is concerned that there was no evidence of unexplained wealth or real profit. 

37Mr Williams was realistic about his client's prospects of rehabilitation, acknowledging that he is still a drug addict but he does have his family supporting him. He pointed out, which is obvious, that his client has destroyed a good part of his life so far and the relationship with his children has obviously been badly affected. He would have a need for supervision when he is released. His client would be prepared to consider a residential rehabilitation program. Mr Williams suggested that I may take that into account, but, as Mr Laird correctly pointed out, that is not something that would be appropriate for me to take into account because his client has not yet undertaken such a program. 

38As for the commercial supply which carries a standard non-parole period, Mr Williams acknowledged the force of the fact that there was a standard non-parole period but reminded me that that was one of many factors that I take into account. He argued that his client's case was not within the middle of the range of objective seriousness. I accept that submission. 

39Taking all those matters into account. I would regard an overall appropriate sentence for the offence of supplying a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug as being of one of 5 years and 6 months imprisonment I would, because of Mr Kokla's plea of guilty, discount that sentence by 25 per cent and round off the sentence to one of 4 years imprisonment. 

40Normally a sentence of 4 years imprisonment should attract a non-parole period of 3 years imprisonment. I propose to adjust that downwards because of Mr Kokla's obvious need for supervision when he is released on parole in order to deal with his serious drug addiction and get himself re-established within the community. I propose to reduce the non-parole period to one of 2 years and 3 months. That sentence will date from 28 May 2013. 

41In respect of the offence of supplying a prohibited drug - and taking into account all of the matters which I am asked to take into account under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 - I regard an appropriate sentence as being one of 18 months which I would set as a fixed term. 

HIS HONOUR: Would you stand up Mr Kokla. 

42In respect of the offence of supplying not less than a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug I formally convict you of that crime. I set a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months to commence 24 May 2013 [Sic. This should read 28 May. The formal orders are correct.] and to expire on 27 August 2015. The balance of the term is 1 year and 9 months to commence 28 August 2015 and to expire on 27 May 2017. 

43In respect of the offence of supplying a prohibited drug I formally convict you of that offence and I sentence you to 18 months imprisonment to commence 18 May 2013 and to expire on 27 November 2014. That is a fixed term. 

44In respect of the offence of possessing a prohibited drug, I formally convict you of that offence and under s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I dispose of the proceedings without imposing any other penalty. 

HIS HONOUR: Have a seat Mr Kokla. Mr Laird, Mr Hajje, the mathematics--
HAJJE: Sorry your Honour, that 18 months fixed term for the supply was to commence was it 18 May?
HIS HONOUR: No, 28 May. Did I say 18th?
HAJJE: I think you did.

45The fixed term should commence 28 May 2013 and expire on 27 November 2014. 

HIS HONOUR: So just check the figures gentlemen, make sure that they're right. It'll save having to come back.
HUTCHIE: Seems to be right, your Honour, thank you.
HIS HONOUR: And any other factual or legal matters that can be dealt with under s 43.
LAIRD: Pursuant to the Confiscation of Proceeds of Crime Act, I seek an order for the confiscation of the cash and two mobile phones. 
HIS HONOUR: Referred to that. Show it to Mr Hajje.
HAJJE: No objection your Honour.
LAIRD: If your Honour signs all three and seals all three and keeps one on the Registry file, and returns the two other copies to us at the bar table. 

46By consent I make the orders contained in the short minutes of order signed and sealed by me and dated today. 

HIS HONOUR: One copy for the Court file and two copies, one for each party. 
LAIRD: Your Honour will recall there are two s 166 certificates. In relation to the s 166 certificate dated 24 October 2012, I withdraw sequence 18 if you want to so note that.
HIS HONOUR: What was that date?
LAIRD: 24 October 2012 if you want to dismiss as that. Sequence 18. That'll take into account all outstanding charges. 
HIS HONOUR: So that can be dismissed. 
LAIRD: Thank you, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: That's number 18 is that right?
LAIRD: Yes, that's a backup charge to one of the counts that your Honour sentenced him.
HIS HONOUR: All right. 

47The offence referred to as sequence 18 on a certificate dated 24 October 2012 under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 signed on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions is dismissed under s 167 of the same Act.

LAIRD: But I seek the formal order that the drugs be destroyed.

48I order that the drugs be destroyed under s 39P of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. 

LAIRD: Thank you, your Honour. That takes into account anything the Crown has.
HIS HONOUR: Any errors that I can--
LAIRD: No, thank you. The mathematics is correct. 

49Mr Kokla, you have got 4 years gaol for the commercial supply of all those tablets that you had, the commercial quantity. You have got 4 years gaol for that. As I said, normally you would have a non-parole period of 3 years for that, that you would have to spend in gaol. But I have reduced that at Mr Williams' request and Mr Laird agreed, because you need extra time when you get out into the community to deal with this drug addiction that you are still in the grip of. So I have reduced you to 2 years and 3 months, that is 27 months. And your sentence is backdated to last Tuesday because I have taken into account the time you spent in custody and the time over the weekend, this weekend. So you become eligible for parole on 27 August 2015. The Parole Authority considers your eligibility. If you make an application before then and if it regards you as eligible and suitable, it will release you on parole. Your sentence is still running for the balance of the 4 years and expires in the end on 27 May 2017. That is 4 years from last Tuesday. The ordinary supply so to speak, I have fixed 18 months and both Mr Williams and Mr Laird agreed that can run at the same time because it occurred at the same time. And the possession of the small amount of notes I have just noted a conviction. So it is up to you what you do with your life now. You are still a relatively young man and you have obviously faced these things before and it is now up to you. 

HIS HONOUR: Anything else? No, all right. I'll now adjourn.

		24 October 2013",2013-06-02 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2706662,R v Nguyen [2013] NSWDC 340,"Judgment


	
	Kim Giau NGUYEN pleaded guilty to an offence. She now wants me to set aside that plea of guilty. She was charged with an offence of importing a substance contrary to a provision of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). On 12 March 2013 she pleaded guilty to that offence in court. At the time she was represented by a barrister and a solicitor. Her son was with her.
	
	
	Ms Nguyen was born in Vietnam and has been in Australia since 1991. She speaks Vietnamese and, I accept, has limited understanding of English. She said in an affidavit which was put into evidence by her counsel, Ms M T Bateman, that she entered a plea of guilty “because the goods were in my possession and I was of the understanding that my sentence would be reduced if I entered a guilty plea”. But she goes on to say that she “did not properly understand the nature of the charge” and she adds that specifically she “did not understand the element of the charge of ‘being reckless’“. She claims that the goods which were imported into Australia were indeed imported by her but she did not know that the importation of those goods was prohibited. She claims that she was not aware of any risk that she was importing prohibited goods.
	
	
	Ms Bateman made her client available for cross-examination by Mr R J Ferral-Smith, the representative of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions who is prosecuting her. She acknowledged that she was being represented by a Vietnamese speaking solicitor who had experience in criminal matters. However when Mr Ferral-Smith wanted to seek some more specific information about her state of mind on the day that she entered her plea of guilty she claimed legal professional privilege in respect of some specific questions. This somewhat frustrated the process of finding out what the true position was at the time that she entered the plea of guilty.
	
	
	The entry of a plea of guilty is a solemn step and it formally acknowledges the elements of an offence. But as Dawson J and McHugh J said in Maxwell v The Queen [1996] HCA 46; (1996) 184 CLR 501; (1996) 87 A Crim R 180 at 511([20]), such a plea must “be unequivocal and not made in circumstances suggesting that it is not a true admission of guilt. Those circumstances include ignorance, fear, duress, mistake or even the desire to gain a technical advantage.”
	
	
	In Wong v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2005] NSWSC 129; (2005) 155 A Crim R 37, Howie J referred to the authorities on setting aside a plea and said at 41([16]) that they “show that the issue is one of the integrity of the plea of guilty and the question to be determined is whether a miscarriage of justice would arise if the court acted upon the plea of guilty to convict and sentence the defendant.” His Honour went on to say at 42([19]) that “if there were any basis upon which the integrity of the plea is seriously called into question or any other reason that would make it unfair for the court to act upon the plea, there would inevitably be a miscarriage of justice by refusing to allow the defendant to withdraw the plea and defend the charge.”
	
	
	In addition, Howie J acknowledged that the Court of Criminal Appeal has in the past said that a judge should approach the task of setting aside a plea “with caution bordering on circumspection.” His Honour said at 45([35]) that if the “advice that the plaintiff received from his legal representative went to the nature of the charge, the elements of the offence, or whether any conduct of the plaintiff amounted to the offence charged, it might be that the court would more easily come to the view that the plea of guilty did not constitute an admission of all the elements of the offence notwithstanding the plaintiff’s antecedents and his knowledge and familiarity with the criminal process.”
	
	
	Some of those factors are not present in this case so far as I am aware. Howie J contrasted that with a situation where the advice in question might have concerned whether or not the accused person should plead guilty perhaps to obtain some advantage.
	
	
	As I said, the stated evidence leaves a good deal to be desired. Nevertheless, three things bother me about the entry of a plea. The first was that the plea was entered by an accused whose first language was not English. Indeed it seems that her knowledge of English was very limited. The primary person giving her the advice was a barrister and it seems that he did not speak Vietnamese.
	
	
	The second concern that I have is that the issue concerns one of the elements of the offence. It appears that Ms Nguyen acknowledges that she imported the goods but there is an issue in her mind as to whether she was aware of a risk that they were prohibited goods, that risk being substantial. Mr Ferral-Smith says his client relies upon that mental element of the offence. The test of whether one is aware of a substantial risk that goods were prohibited raises some subtleties of understanding. One has to consider the actual state of awareness of the person, the level of the risk and whether that risk can be described as substantial. Without that component being satisfied, by definition there would not be an offence. Ms Nguyen was therefore in a position where she was pleading guilty, receiving advice from a non‑Vietnamese speaking legal advisor - albeit in the presence of two Vietnamese speaking persons, one being her son and the other her solicitor - in circumstances where she acknowledged importing the goods but had to grasp some advice about the subtlety of her state of mind at the time.
	
	
	The third aspect which is not of concern but which reinforces Ms Nguyen’s case, or strengthens it, is the fact that she saw the Probation and Parole Service two months after entering her plea. There is a pre-sentence report prepared by a community corrections officer in preparation for her anticipated sentencing. The pre-sentence report notes that upon “continual questioning by this service, Ms Nguyen maintained her stance that she had unknowingly imported a border controlled precursor into Australia”. The report went on to say that she “agreed with the police facts, though she strongly denied wilfully importing a border controlled precursor into Australia.” I do not have the police facts before me in evidence.
	
	
	Mr Ferral-Smith correctly observes that this offence involves recklessness rather than knowledge or wilfulness but that illustrates somewhat my concern about the subtleties involved in describing the various states of mind. What seems to be clear is that about two months after entering her plea Ms Nguyen was making it clear to the Probation and Parole Service that she did not regard herself as guilty of the offence.
	
	
	I am myself concerned that there is some risk, because of these factors, that the plea of guilty may have been entered accompanied by some degree of ignorance - either legal or linguistic - on Ms Nguyen’s part. This in turn would affect the integrity of the plea.
	
	
	For that reason I propose to grant the application and grant leave to Ms Nguyen to withdraw her plea.
	


HIS HONOUR: Now what happens next, if anything? What orders if anything should I make?

FERRAL-SMITH: I think your Honour my friend and I agree that perhaps the best thing is for the matter to be restored to the short matters list for the purposes of obtaining a trial date.

HIS HONOUR: What order do I make to do that?

DISCUSSION AS TO SUITABLE DATE

HIS HONOUR: I stand the matter over to the short matters list before the Chief Judge or whoever is sitting in that list on Friday 14 June 2013 for the allocation of a hearing date for a trial. Does that sound right that I’ve made the right procedural order to get it where it should be--

FERRAL-SMITH: I believe so your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: --in a couple of weeks time. The papers can go on the file, and bail is continued. Is Ms Nguyen on bail?

FERRAL-SMITH: Yes.

BATEMAN: She is. Just to continue.

HIS HONOUR: The same conditions?

FERRAL-SMITH: Thank you.


	
	Bail is continued on the same conditions as presently affixed until Friday 14 June 2013.
	


HIS HONOUR: Is that right?

FERRAL-SMITH: Yes thank you your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: So she’ll need to turn up on that day to have her bail continued. Thank you both very much for your assistance. Something else you’re thinking of Ms Bateman?

BATEMAN: Just as to - I thought when your Honour made the order for the setting down of the hearing date, it probably is to go there for arraignment.

HIS HONOUR: Thank you. The purpose of it being listed on 14 June - I think you’re right - should be for the accused to be arraigned. You’re right. Anything else? No, no.

		10 February 2016",2013-06-02 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2706680,R v Shoesmith [2013] NSWCCA 127,"Judgment

1PRICE J: Following a trial in the District Court before a judge and jury, the applicant was convicted of one count of robbery, whilst armed with a dangerous weapon contrary to s 97(2) Crimes Act 1900 and one count of threatening injury with intent to hinder the lawful apprehension of himself contrary to s 33B(b) Crimes Act. The applicant appeals against his conviction on the following grounds: 

1. His Honour the trial judge erred in his directions to the jury on 
alibi evidence.

2. The verdicts of guilty are unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence.

2The central issue at trial was the identification of the person who robbed the Bradfield Newsagency on 26 January 2011 (Australia Day). The Crown case depended heavily for its acceptance on the evidence of CP, an 11 year-old boy. It was the applicant's case that he did not rob the newsagency but was in Sussex Inlet. He called three witnesses who testified that he was with them in Sussex Inlet on Australia Day 2011. It was put in the applicant's case that none of the witnesses to the robbery observed gloves or tattoos on the hands of the robber but that the applicant had tattoos across the backs of the hands. It was the applicant's case that CP was mistaken in the recognition of the applicant's voice and that CP was mistaken or made an assumption about the shoes CP said the offender was wearing. 

3The trial commenced on 5 March 2012, the jury retired on 7 March 2012 and the verdicts were delivered on 8 March 2012.

4On the hearing of this appeal, Mr M Smith appeared for the applicant and Ms J A Girdham SC for the Crown. 

5In light of the Grounds of Appeal, it is necessary to set out in some detail the evidence that was led at the trial. 

The Crown case 

6There was no dispute that on 26 January 2011 (Australia Day) an offender, wearing a balaclava and holding a gun, entered the Bradfield newsagency and committed a robbery, threatening Mr Nguyen the proprietor and taking seventy dollars from the cash register. Mr Nguyen described the offender who was wearing a black balaclava on his face as being about 180 centimetres with a slim build. He was speaking normally and sounded Australian. Mr Nguyen said that he did not know if the person was wearing gloves. He thought that the offender had on a white jacket and dark blue trousers. As the offender ran out of the newsagency, he encountered Mr Hona saying to him words to the effect of ""move or I'll shoot."" Mr Hona, believing the gun was not real, replied ""well shoot me then."" In cross-examination, Mr Hona said that he couldn't remember whether the person was wearing gloves or not. He couldn't recall the shoes or their colour that the offender was wearing. The offender ran down an alley at the back of the shopping centre and continued on through several streets past Mr and Mrs Kirmaier who observed him running, with his balaclava on, carrying a gun and entering a parked vehicle which was occupied by two unidentified persons. 

7Mr Kirmaier described the offender as being roughly 175 to 180 centimetres tall and a skinny sort of build. He initially came down Abercrombie Street where Mr Kiramaier saw a white VR or VS Holden Commodore station wagon with he thought two guys sitting in the driver and passenger seats. Mr Kirmaier had no memory of what the offender's shoes looked like. He didn't see any gloves and wouldn't be able to say if the offender had gloves on or not.

8Mrs Kirmaier gave evidence that she saw out of the corner of her eye someone run past. She recounted that he had a ""t-shirt on and he had joggers"" and a ""dark sort of tracksuity parachute material sort of pants"" on. She described the shoes as being probably ""dirty white coloured joggers"".

9CP who lived with his Nan, said that he was eleven years old in January 2011. He gave evidence that he was standing on the driveway of 20 Abercrombie Street when he saw the offender running down the street towards number 9. When the offender got there the offender yelled out, ""Hurry up coppers are coming open the door."" He recognised the voice as belonging to Shoey, David Shoesmith or David Shoey. Shoey was his nickname. He had known Shoey since he was little. He was friends with his uncle and his family. He had seen him a lot. He would normally see Shoey at the shops or at his mum's house. He said he saw him at his mum's house very often ""like about four times or something more than that"". The day he saw the man run down the street and recognised the voice as Shoey's was Australia Day. He had seen Shoey the weekend before at his mum's house. Shoey was there all weekend. Shoey spoke to him on that weekend and he heard him talking to other people as well. 

10CP said that it was ""[h]e's [sic] like expression sort of"" and ""like the words that he said, like the letters"" that he recognised when he heard Shoey yelling. A particular sound that he thought sounded very much like Shoey was the word ""car"" which he'd heard him say before. 

11CP couldn't see the face of the offender who was running because he had a balaclava on. He was the size of Detective Napier. The offender who he saw running was the same height and the same thinness as Shoey. The offender was wearing a white shirt, black pants and golden Asics because he saw them the weekend before at his mum's house. The shoes that the offender was wearing looked exactly the same as the shoes Shoey was wearing at his mum's place. They were white and gold. They were gold on most of the shoe and white near the toe and the rubber on the bottom. When asked whether they looked new, CP replied, ""just normal"".

12CP had seen Shoey around the Bradfield shops only a few times. He had seen him at the shops, at his mum's house or at Shoey's house only about once or twice. When he was asked how sure the voice he heard was Shoeys, he replied, ""I exactly knew his voice when he was at my mum's, exactly, 100 per cent"". The offender yelled out, ""[h]urry up coppers are coming"" and then the guy in the car opened the door for him and he dived in and they drove off fast. CP ran back to his friend Sean's mum and told her what had happened. He thought she rang the police and then he ran back home to his Nan's place. The police took a statement from him later the same day. 

13In cross-examination CP agreed that he had seen Shoey about three or two times at the shops, once or twice at Shoey's house; and about four times at his mum's place. When he saw him at the shops, it was a quick hello, goodbye. He was at Shoey's house for just a few minutes, like half an hour.

14CP agreed that the offender was running away from him when he yelled. He knew the shoes were Asics because he ""could see the 'A' because I've seen them shoes before"". He agreed the closest the person got to him was from the corner of Barker Street on the left hand side from the back of the driveway.

15The grandmother of CP said in evidence that CP had lived with her since he was eighteen months old. She had known the applicant for about eight years as he was a good friend of her son Allan. She knew him by his nickname ""Shoey"". Allan had lived with her in the time that she had known the applicant and Allan had also lived at his sisters. Shoey had been to her house on many occasions and CP had been there. She couldn't count the number of times Shoey had been at her house when CP had been there. 

16Gary Thomas Stanton gave evidence that he had known the applicant since primary school. He had a younger brother named Daniel who is a similar build to him. The police asked him what he could remember of Australia Day 2011 and around that time. Mr Stanton said that he didn't spend time in Sussex Inlet around January 2011. He had been there once but he hadn't been there for a couple of years. He did not know anyone named Scotty. The Crown was given leave to cross-examine Mr Stanton. He was shown a notebook statement and agreed that it recorded ""I stayed for one night with a friend of mine called Scotty"" but denied he said that in his statement or that he had a friend called Scotty. He remembered saying to police that he went to Sussex Inlet once only and that was to a tattoo shop. He never stayed down at Sussex Inlet. He did not know the name of the owner of that tattoo shop. He agreed that he knew someone called Scotty who had some connection with a tattoo shop in Sussex Inlet but he had never stayed at his place. He didn't go to Sussex Inlet with the applicant in January 2011.

17Detective Senior Constable McManus interviewed the applicant on 1 March 2011 by way of ERISP. The DVD and transcript of the ERISP became exhibits G and H. Detective McManus identified the shoes that the applicant was wearing when arrested. He said that the reference in the interview to the applicant wearing gold Asic's runners at the time of the arrest was wrong, and that when the applicant said in the interview that the runners were black and silver, that was correct. These shoes became exhibit J. The applicant had agreed to give a sample of his DNA which was taken. 

18The applicant said in the ERISP interview that on Australia Day he was having a barbecue with his mates Scotty and Daniel. He didn't know their last names. Scotty lived at Sussex Inlet and he was thirty odd. Daniel lived at Campbelltown and was 20 something. Gazza, Daniel's brother arrived first. Scotty and his missus lived at the house and her name was Liz. They went down the night before. He couldn't remember who drove but he thought he went down with Daniel and Adam. Adam was more Daniel's mate. Adam owned a car and he was pretty sure that he drove. They stayed the night of the 25th. He stayed there for the whole weekend and then he went back down and stayed there for a couple of days again. On Australia Day they were just drinking and having a barbeque and then they went out on a boat. It was a boat big enough to fit 10 to 15 people and it was a boat for wake boarding. Nobody went wake boarding on that day but they went down the sand hills on a disc they pulled behind a boat. They went fishing but they didn't catch anything. He met a couple of people on the boat that day. Scott's kids were there. He did not leave Sussex Inlet at all from Tuesday to Friday. Scott gave him a lift up to Sydney on Friday.

19The applicant said that he owned a white jacket but it wasn't completely white, it was white, grey and black. He does not own any guns. He doesn't know anyone who owns a white Holden Commodore. He said that the police had taken his black and silver Asics runners. He said they didn't have gold on them but they had some yellow. He didn't know anything about the robbery.

20Detective Senior Constable Napier gave evidence that he took a statement from CP in the mid afternoon of 26 January 2011 shortly after the robbery. CP had nominated the applicant as being the person he recognised. The Forensic Section came to the scene of the robbery and looked for fingerprints and possible DNA evidence but they didn't find either. 

21Detective Napier agreed that the applicant raised an alibi defence in the ERISP and nominated Garry Stanton and Daniel Stanton as alibi witnesses. Detective Napier sought to obtain a statement from Daniel Stanton who indicated that he was not prepared to give evidence on behalf of the prosecution. The applicant also nominated a person he referred to as Scotty. After speaking with Daniel and Garry Stanton, he established that a person called Scotty owned a tattoo parlour in Sussex Inlet. Detective Napier attempted to contact that person and left messages but he made no contact and there was no reply. 

22Detective Napier received two alibi notices on the morning he gave evidence that referred to Adam John Holland, Elizabeth Mitchell and Nicole Kokaev. He spoke with Mr Holland who said he was not prepared to make a statement or give evidence on behalf of the prosecution. Ms Mitchell made a statement which he received a short time ago. He spoke to Ms Kokaev a short time before giving evidence and she indicated that she was not prepared to make a statement or give evidence on behalf of the prosecution. Detective Napier identified a handwritten statement from Gary Stanton in which Mr Stanton said, ""I stayed for one night with a friend of mine called Scotty"".

The applicant's case 

23The applicant gave evidence that what he said in his interview with police on 1 March 2011 was true and correct. He said he was about 170 centimetres tall and had for two years a number of tattoos on his arms and hands. He identified the Asics brand shoes (ex J) as being his and said that they were the only Asics shoes he has owned. 

24He knew CP through CP's uncle Allan who was the applicant's age. He did not know CP too well. He didn't often have contact with CP but would sometimes have contact with him at CP's uncle's girlfriend's place or CP's mum's place. The last time he saw him was the weekend before Australia Day. When he would speak to Allan, CP was not present. When he visited Allan, CP was not present. 

25The applicant said that he was down in Sussex Inlet on Australia Day 2011, having gone down the night before with his friends Adam and Daniel Stanton, they drank, had a barbeque, and went on a boat. Scotty, Adam, Liz and their kids were on the boat. He recalled that they went sand boarding that day. He thought he was in Sussex Inlet for a week but he didn't have an exact memory of that. He denied that he committed the robbery. 

26In cross-examination, he said that he had seen CP around for a decade or so. He had spoken to CP just to say hello and CP is someone who was around and present when he was speaking with other members of CP's family. He went to Kelly's (Allan's sister, CP's mum) house the weekend before Australia Day 2011 but he didn't stay there. He agreed that CP was there that weekend. He just said hello to him but CP would have been in a position to hear his voice at different times on the weekend. 

27Adam John Holland, a truck driver, said that he was in Sussex Inlet on 26 January 2011. He had driven down there a few days beforehand with the applicant and his cousin Scott Browley. He left to go to Sussex Inlet before his birthday which was on 24 January. He knew it was before his birthday because that's where he had his birthday and he usually has his birthday down at Sussex Inlet every year. He stayed at Scott Browley's house where the applicant, Nicole Kokaev (his ex-girlfriend) and his two step-daughters, Chloe and Tamika Kokaev also stayed.

28He recalled that on Australia Day, the applicant, himself, Nicole Kokaev, his two-step daughters, Frank (who owned the boat), Scott Browley, Elizabeth (Scott's ex girlfriend) and Frank's two children were out on the boat. They were inside the inlet and he recalled running up and down the sand dunes. He, the applicant, Scott and Jason Lord ran up and down the sand dunes. He remembered the applicant going for a walk with his two step daughters. The girls were picking up things out of the water and the applicant would run away. They would yell out ""shark"" and would run out of the water. The day would have ended towards late in the afternoon. Mr Holland said that he would have returned to Sydney maybe a day or two later and that the applicant did not come back with him. 

29In cross-examination, Mr Holland said that he hadn't known the applicant long before January 2011. The applicant was good friends with Dan and that was how he met him. He probably invited the applicant down there because there were some spare seats in the car. He agreed that it wasn't the case that he took the applicant down to Sussex Inlet on the night before Australia Day because they were already down there. They celebrated his birthday down there. The first time he was asked to cast his mind back to January 2011 was in the last few days. 

30Nicole Kokaev, Mr Holland's ex partner, gave evidence that on Australia Day 2011 she was in Sussex Inlet. She went there about 22 or 23 January because her ex-partner Adam Holland had his birthday on 24 January and they go down there every Australia Day long weekend. The group of people she was there with included Liz and Scotty whose house they were staying at, their two children, the applicant, Adam Holland, Jason Lord, Troy Holm, her stepson Kyle Hayward, her two children, and Frank who had the boat. The applicant was at Sussex Inlet when she arrived. She wasn't aware when he left, but she left first. 

31On Australia Day they all went out on the boat which was a big boat. They went out to a sand dune. The boys got on a donut that goes on the back of the boat. Her kids were playing with the applicant in the water with the fish. They went out on the boat in the early morning taking food with them. They finished up at dusk as the sun set. They came back to Scott and Liz's house and had a barbeque. She can remember every Australia Day but she remembered that one because it was the last one with Adam and the last time she went to Sussex Inlet for the Australia Day long weekend.

32In cross-examination, Ms Kokaev said that the first time she was asked to recall what she did on Australia Day 2011 was the Monday before when Troy phoned her and asked her did she remember anything from that particular Australia Day. She spoke to Adam about it on maybe the day that Troy spoke to her and he said that he got in contact with the solicitor. She went to the hospital the evening before she gave her evidence and she briefly spoke with Adam about the matter. At the time she spoke with Adam the day before she didn't know that he had given evidence in the trial. She and Adam are not together and she denied that they are still on good terms. She went to the hospital because he was still on the health fund and he had a good relationship with her children. 

33Ms Kokaev agreed that she would class the applicant as a friend. She agreed that she would want to make sure that he was not wrongly convicted and she was prepared to tell the truth in order to make that happen. She agreed that she refused to make a statement about this matter to Detective Senior Constable Napier. She told him what she knew but she didn't want to write a statement.

34Elizabeth Mitchell, a real estate agent, said in evidence that she met the applicant through a mutual friend when he was doing some gardening at her friend's house in either December 2010 or the beginning of January 2011. He later came down to her place at Sussex Inlet for Adam Holland's birthday which was approximately 24 or 25 January 2011. She could not give an exact day but the applicant left Sussex Inlet close to the end of February 2011.

35On Australia Day 2011, they left her home about 10 o'clock in the morning to go boating for the day. There were quite a few people on the boating trip including Frank, the boat owner, Adam Holland and his girlfriend Nic, Nic's two kids Chloe and Tamika, Ms Mitchell's two kids, the applicant, Jason Lord and her ex-partner Scott Browley, her daughter Kiara, and Kiara's partner Ashley. They finished at approximately 4 or 5pm. During the day, the applicant was never out of her company. They couldn't keep their eyes off the applicant as ""he was the most funniest bloke."" He was afraid of the water and they all kept yelling out ""shark"" and he would run out of the water. During the day they sunbaked, drank, and swam.

36She remembered this particular Australia Day because a week or a couple of weeks after, the applicant went with her partner to get a dog and the dog was now a year old. Her daughter's birthday was coming up on 24 March 2011 and the applicant was looking forward to her daughter's birthday and he missed it. 

37In cross-examination Ms Mitchell said that she was first asked to recall what happened on Australia Day 2011 on the Monday afternoon prior to the Wednesday of her giving evidence. It wasn't common that people came to her place at Sussex Inlet to celebrate Adam Holland's birthday but it happened two or three times. She said that the applicant lived at her house for about five or six weeks until February. She was sure that the applicant was there for Adam Holland's birthday which she was pretty sure was on 24 January. They all came down in a group for his birthday. They came down the day before or two days before the birthday. She said it was not possible that the applicant came down the night of 25 January. She said they came down during the day. There would have been five extra adults and probably an extra four children staying at her house during that time. 

38Ms Mitchell gave evidence that she didn't know the applicant at all when he turned up at her place. She had only seen him once at a friend's house. The applicant was always at her home when she arrived home from work in February. He never left the house unless he went fishing. He used to go fishing with her partner, Scott Browley. She was 100 per cent certain that from when he arrived before Australia Day until about the end of February he spent every night at her house. She said she was ""210 per cent"" certain and she ""knew for a fact"" that the applicant was with them for Australia Day. 

Ground 1: His Honour the Trial Judge erred in his direction to the Jury on alibi evidence 

39The applicant gave evidence that he was at Sussex Inlet and not in Leumeah when the robbery was committed. Mr Holland, Ms Kokaev and Ms Mitchell testified that he was in Sussex Inlet on that day. Where an alibi is raised, an accused does not bear the onus of proving the alibi. The onus rests on the Crown to remove any reasonable doubt which may have been raised by the alibi claim. As Hunt CJ at CL observed in R v Small (1994) 33 NSWLR 575 at 596:

""In other words, the Crown had to eliminate any reasonable possibility that the alibi was true.""

40Mr Smith contended that the judge's directions to the jury on alibi were inadequate. He complained that the jury were never told what they should do in the event that they neither accepted, nor rejected some or all of the alibi evidence and they should have been informed that the Crown could not discharge its onus if there was a reasonable possibility that one of the alibi witnesses was accurate in their evidence. 

41Mr Smith said that the following direction ought to have been given (T 22/4/13 T1 L40-46): 

""The Crown must establish beyond reasonable doubt the accused was at Leumeah at the relevant time. The Crown cannot do so if there is any reasonable possibility that the accused was at Sussex Inlet at the time as asserted by the alibi evidence. The Crown must therefore remove or eliminate any reasonable possibility that the accused was at Sussex Inlet at the relevant time"". 

42This direction was modelled on what this Court considered to be an appropriate alibi direction in R v Kanaan [2005] NSWCCA 385; (2005) 64 NSWLR 527 at [135]. 

43The judge did not give a direction in the terms that the applicant suggested. However, his Honour made it very clear that the Crown bore the burden of establishing beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had committed the robbery and by raising an alibi, the burden of proof did not shift, but the Crown had to disprove the alibi beyond reasonable doubt. His Honour said (SU5):

""...A person involved in alleged criminal activity where it is asserted that he or she committed an offence is entitled at all times to remain mute and say nothing and no inference against that person can be drawn from the fact that they do remain mute, because at all times it is the Crown that bears the burden of proof, and even in this case, where there has been raised alibi evidence and Mr Shoesmith has given evidence himself, he had to prove nothing. The Crown has the burden of proving that the offence occurred in the way in which it asserts and the Crown has to disprove to your satisfaction, on the requisite standard, any alibi evidence."" (italics added)

44After directing the jury about voice recognition, the judge returned to the evidence of alibi (SU8). His Honour instructed the jury that if they accepted the alibi evidence, then they were obliged to acquit. Furthermore, they were not required to believe that the applicant or his witnesses were telling the truth before he was entitled to acquittal. The members of the jury were told that even if they reached the conclusion that the alibi witnesses were unreliable or lacked credibility that of itself did not necessarily mean that the Crown could succeed in its case. It was still essential that the Crown proved beyond reasonable doubt that it was the applicant who was at Leumeah. 

45 The judge then summarised the substance of the applicant's case. His Honour turned to the issue of identification and the need to exercise special caution. Shortly before sending the jury out, his Honour said (SU11): 

""I should mention one more thing that the fact that the accused has given evidence does not alter the burden of proof. I've said that in a number of ways already but it is important that it be stressed, because the accused does not have to prove that his or her version is true. The Crown has to satisfy you that the account given by the accused and the defence witnesses should not be accepted as a version of events that could reasonably be true"". (italics added) 

46By this direction, the judge made it apparent to the jury that the Crown was obliged to satisfy them that there was no reasonable possibility that the applicant was at Sussex Inlet at the time of the robbery. 

47No objection was taken at trial by counsel appearing for the applicant to the judge's directions on alibi. No further directions were required. 

48Ground 1 is not established. 

Ground 2: The verdicts of guilty are unreasonable and cannot be supported by evidence. 

49Mr Smith submitted that in this case the identification evidence was fraught with even more danger than that which ordinarily attends such evidence as CP was 11 years old at the time and just 12 years old at the time of giving evidence. He argued that although the witness' age was not in itself a ground to reject the evidence, CP lacked sufficient life experience to make a value judgment about the possibility that his identification was wrong. It was contended that CP had simply not been present in enough situations through the course of his life to realise that mistakes can be made as to identification even with people very well known.

50Balanced against CP's evidence, Mr Smith said, was the evidence of three witnesses who were resolute in their evidence that the applicant had been at Sussex Inlet on Australia Day 2011. Although there had been some inconsistency in the testimony as to his presence at Sussex Inlet on Australia Day, this was not a recent invention as he had raised his alibi in his ERISP, many months prior to the trial and only five weeks after the offence. 

51No complaint was made by Mr Smith about the trial judge's directions on CP's evidence of voice recognition. In short, the members of the jury were instructed that they were required to approach the task of assessing the reliability of CP's evidence with special caution, they needed to consider carefully the evidence as to CP's familiarity with the applicant and to the circumstances in which CP said that he heard the applicant. They were told that unless they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that CP was both an honest and accurate witness, they could not find the applicant to be guilty. 

52Mr Smith, however, seemed to suggest in his written submissions that CP should have been directed that mistakes can be made as to identification (AWS [102]-[103]). I would reject that suggestion. It was not his Honour's task to tell CP that such mistakes can be made. In any event, the applicant's counsel at trial put it to CP that he didn't hear Shoey's voice on the day of the robbery and that he was mistaken, which CP disagreed with. 

53The Crown submitted that this Court would not conclude that the factual circumstances of the case required the applicant's acquittal. The Crown argued that it cannot be demonstrated that CP's evidence as to the identification of CP's voice, or distinctive shoes lacked the necessary probative value to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt. 

54A convenient summary of this Court's task where the ground of appeal raises a question of unreasonableness of a verdict is provided by Johnson J (with whom Macfarlan JA and Garling J agreed) in Raumakita v R [2011] NSWCCA 126; (2011) 210 A Crim R 326 at [31]-[34]:

""In determining a ground of appeal which asserts, for the purpose of s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912, that the verdict was unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, this Court is required to apply the test set down in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 493, and restated in MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606. The Court is to make an independent assessment of the evidence, both to its sufficiency and quality. This involves a question of fact. The Court is to determine whether the evidence is such that it was open to a jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant was guilty. The central question is whether this Court is satisfied that the Appellant is guilty of the offence charged in the first count: Morris v The Queen [1987] HCA 50; 163 CLR 454 at 473; SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 85 ALJR 571 at 575 [11]-[14], 576-577 [20]-[22]. 

In exercising that function, the evidence ought not be considered piecemeal: The Queen v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; 228 CLR 618 at 637-638 [46]-[48]; The Queen v Keenan [2009] HCA 1; 236 CLR 397 at 435 [128]. This Court is required to consider the totality of evidence before the jury. This involves an assessment of direct evidence of witnesses, and inferences to be drawn from a combination of events: Rasic v R [[2009] NSWCCA 202] at [29]. 

In some cases, the fact that the Court of Criminal Appeal has not seen or heard the witnesses at trial may have a bearing on the outcome of an appeal on an unreasonable verdict ground. In M v The Queen , Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson Toohey JJ said at 494-495: 
'In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. In doing so, the court is not substituting trial by a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. Although the propositions stated in the four preceding sentences have been variously expressed in judgments of members of the court in previous cases, we have put aside those differences in expression in order to provide authoritative guidance to courts of criminal appeal by stating the propositions in the form in which they are set out above.' 

The M v The Queen formulation of the task of this Court has been emphasised by the High Court in later cases: The Queen v Nguyen [2010] HCA 38; 85 ALJR 8 at 14 [33]; SKA v The Queen at 575 [13].""

55It is uncontroversial that CP's evidence was crucial to the question of the applicant's guilt. There was no other evidence that the Crown relied on to establish that he was the person who robbed the Bradfield Newsagency. CP was a 100 per cent certain that the person who yelled out ""[h]urry up coppers are coming open the door"" was the applicant. He told his friend's mother what had happened and gave a statement that afternoon to Detective Senior Constable Napier nominating the applicant as the person he recognised. CP marked on the plan (ex B) where the man was when he heard him yelling, where the getaway car was, and where he was standing when he first saw the person. In cross-examination, CP agreed that there was the distance of one house in between where he was standing and where the person was yelling. Other than this evidence and the markings on the plan, no evidence was given as to the distance between CP and the person when the words were yelled out but the Crown Prosecutor put to the members of the jury that it might have been ""some tens of metres perhaps"" and suggested that this was a leafy suburban area in the middle of the day where voices carry clearly. It is evident when the words were spoken, that the person was some distance away from CP. 

56CP was asked by the Crown Prosecutor what was it about the voice that he recognised. On this topic, the following evidence was given (T 05/03/12 T67 L21-47): 

""Q Now you recognised his voice when you heard him yelling out?
A Yes

Q What is it about his voice that you recognised?
A He's [sic] like expression sort of.

Q Can you explain to us what you mean by that?
A Like, like the words that he said, like the letters.

Q The letter sounds of words is that what you're saying?
A Yeah.

Q Any particular sounds that you thought sounded very much like him?
A Yes

Q What particular sounds?
A Like ""car"".

Q That's something you'd heard him say before is that right?
A Yes

Q And the way he said ""car"" it sounded like you'd heard before is that right?
A Yes.""

57CP identified the word ""car"" as being a word that he had heard Shoey say before. The difficulty with this evidence was that CP's testimony of what he heard the person yell out did not include the word ""car"". In his closing address to the jury the Crown Prosecutor recognised the problem but suggested that the word ""car"" must have been used for CP to make that observation. This submission should not have been put to the jury by the Crown Prosecutor as CP had been asked by the applicant's counsel (T 05/03/12 T77 L15-21):

""Q And the words you say you heard this person yell out, ""Hurry up the coppers are coming, open the door"", is that right?
A Yes.

Q Nothing else apart from those words?
A No.""

58The identification by CP of a word that was not used by the person as a basis for his recognition of the applicant's voice to my mind strikes at the reliability of his evidence. No other peculiar characteristics or matters of distinction were attributed by CP to the applicant's voice. 

59CP's evidence that he knew Shoey's voice was supported by his grandmother. However, the opportunity that he had to hear the person's voice on the day of the robbery was limited. The person had run past him and there was a distance of one house between them. The Crown Prosecutor estimated the distance to be ""some tens of metres"". What was said by the person was confined to nine words. The Crown Prosecutor told the jury that there wasn't anything particularly distinctive about the applicant's voice. 

60The Crown Prosecutor submitted to the jury that CP's identification of the applicant's voice was supported by his evidence that the height and build of the person were exactly the same as Shoeys and he recognised the shoes. CP gave evidence that the person was wearing golden Asics shoes that looked exactly the same as the shoes he saw Shoey wearing at his mum's place the weekend before. He was asked by the Crown Prosecutor (T 05/03/12 T69 L29-40):

""Q Whereabouts is the gold part of them?
A Just on some like, just like on most of the shoe.

Q And where was the white part of them?
A Just like near the toe and - and the rubber on the bottom

Q Were they new looking shoes or old looking shoes?
A They looked new a little

Q A little new?
A Yeah just like - yeah just normal.""

61In cross-examination, CP agreed that he said that the shoes were new or normal. He said that he could see the ""A"" on the shoes because he had seen them before. CP went on to say that the closest the person got to him was when he was running around the corner of Barker Street. 

62CP's evidence of the shoes that the person was wearing does not fit easily with other evidence in the trial. Mrs Kirmaier estimated that when the person ran past the vehicle in which she was seated, he was about half a metre away. She described the shoes that the person was wearing as probably being dirty white old joggers. In cross-examination, Mrs Kirmaier agreed that she told police that the person had runners on that were white in colour but were old, dirty looking. In answer to a question from the judge, Mrs Kirmaier said that the person would have been ""maybe 5 metres away from the car"" when she could see the person's shoes. She saw him running away from the back. 

63Mr Hona said that he did not recall the shoes that the person was wearing, but when asked if the shoes were bright in colour, did he think that was something that would have stood out in his mind, he replied ""[p]ossibly, yes"". 

64At the time the applicant was arrested, he was wearing black and silver Asics runners. The applicant testified that they were the only Asics shoes that he had and denied that he had worn gold Asics shoes.

65There was also before the jury the evidence of Mr Holland, Ms Kokaev and Ms Mitchell that the applicant was in Sussex Inlet at the time of the robbery. Although there were inconsistencies in the alibi evidence as to when the applicant arrived and departed from Sussex Inlet, these witnesses were adamant that the applicant was on a boat with them on Australia Day 2011. 

66The identification of a voice is notoriously liable to be mistaken. That is why juries are instructed to exercise special caution before accepting voice identification evidence. A careful consideration of CP's evidence leads me to conclude that there is a reasonable possibility that CP was mistaken in identifying the voice of the applicant. In my view, the jury, acting reasonably must have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. I would uphold Ground 2 of the appeal.

67Accordingly, I propose the following orders:

(1)Appeal upheld and the conviction is quashed.

(2)Order the entry of a verdict of acquittal. 

68DAVIES J: I agree with Price J. 

69BARR AJ: I agree with Price J.

2706682,Kizildag v R [2013] NSWCCA 125,"Judgment
1MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Adamson J.
2FULLERTON J: I agree with Adamson J.
Introduction3ADAMSON J: The appellant appeals against his conviction in respect of the following two counts following a trial by jury before Payne DCJ in the District Court at Parramatta: (1)Aggravated taking with assault and driving a motor car contrary to s 154C(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW); and(2)Armed robbery contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act.
4The notice of appeal filed on 27 September 2012 sets out nine grounds of appeal. None of these grounds was pressed. The appellant's amended final submissions filed on 1 November 2012 contain a single ground: a miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the incompetence of counsel.
5The alleged incompetence was said to arise from the failure by trial counsel to cross-examine an eyewitness to the second count about her identification of the appellant in an identification parade.
The Crown case at trial
6The Crown case was that at about 7.00 am on 4 May 2010 the appellant assaulted a woman, Rebecca Lenhard, who had parked her Commodore station wagon in the car park outside Woolworths in the suburb of Miller where she worked. She had just put a club lock on the steering wheel when the appellant approached her and threatened her with a knife which he pointed towards her stomach. In response to his demands she unlocked the club lock and handed over the keys. He then drove the car away at high speed. The appellant lived opposite the car park.
7Ms Lenhard and another employee who had seen the car departing rang the police. Ms Lenhard described the knife as silver, about 30 cms long with holes in the top half. She described the offender as white, with no distinguishing marks on his face, and wearing a sloppy joe, long pants and a baseball cap. She estimated him to be 30-35 years old. Ms Lenhard did not select the appellant from a photograph identification array.
8At about 7.20 am, when Jenny Dang arrived at the Bureddo Bakery at Canley Heights to start work, she put her handbag on the counter. The bag was red with octagonal shapes and contained her laptop, camera, wallet and keys. At about 7.55 am the appellant came into the bakery, ordered a drink and handed over a ten-dollar note. When Ms Dang gave him the change she observed that his hand was dirty.  She also saw that, on one of the three middle fingers of his left hand, there was a cut which had dirt in it. She did not, however, notice anything else about his hand. After she had given him the change, Ms Dang moved her bag to a chair behind the counter before starting to put out more bread. 
9While Ms Dang was arranging the loaves, the appellant grabbed her handbag.  Another employee, Jenny Ly, saw him and came to Ms Dang's aid. A struggle ensued between the two women and the appellant in the course of which he pulled a knife out of his pocket which caused the women to let go of the bag. Another employee, Ellen Tung, had heard Ms Dang scream. She looked in the direction of the scream and saw Ms Dang, Ms Ly and a man struggling and holding up a knife with his right hand. Ms Tung joined Ms Ly in chasing the appellant out of the shop. The appellant ran to the car and drove away. 
10CCTV footage taken from the bank across the road from the bakery showed that the car in which the appellant arrived and departed had been parked for about ten minutes before the appellant entered the bakery and that he was in the bakery for about 79 seconds before driving away.
11Ms Dang described the knife as straight, not serrated, about 20-25 cms long, with a silver blade with circular indents on it. She described the offender as having short dark brown hair with skin colour that was lighter than Mediterranean. She described him as being of medium build, about 175 cms tall and about 40 years old. She took part in a photograph identification array but did not select any photograph.
12Ms Tung estimated the man to be about 40 years old. She recalled him as Caucasian with greyish brown, longish hair which was shorter than shoulder-length and curly on top. Ms Tung did not select anyone in a photo identification array. Ms Tung recalled the knife as an ordinary kitchen knife, about 30 cms long, with a black handle. She wrote down the number plate, which identified the car as Ms Lenhard's.
13Ms Ly identified the appellant in a photo identification array. The video of the identification records the following exchange:
Police: You've indicated photograph number 3.  How confident are you?Ly: Well, confident, this part there [points to forehead].  And his eyes.  And maybe the shape of his face is a bit longer, that's why I'm confident.Police: How confident would you say?Ly: Maybe 95%, 90-95%.Police: Where have you seen this person?Ly: When he pulled out his knife.Police: This is the person that attended the bakery?Ly: Yes, yes.Police: And what did this person do?Ly: He robbed the bag.Police: Are you happy to select this person?Ly: Yes, I'm very happy...definitely him.
14At midday, Ms Lenhard's missing Commodore station wagon was involved in a car accident. It was abandoned by its driver at the scene.
15A black and silver Sunman knife, 28 cms long, was found under the front driver's seat of the car. Ms Dang's handbag was also found in the car, as was a jumper and a drinking straw both of which tested positive for the appellant's DNA.  An appointment slip with the appellant's name on it was also found.  The handle of the knife, the steering wheel and the handbag strap all tested positive for the appellant's DNA.  Ms Lenhard identified certain items in it that did not belong to her.
The appellant's case at trial
16The appellant gave evidence and was cross-examined. His case was that on 4 May 2010 he left home between about 9 am and 9.30 am and travelled by bus to Liverpool Hospital where he had an appointment. He arrived at 10.00 am, had a short consultation and was given another appointment slip. He travelled by bus to Liverpool for lunch and arrived no later than 11.30 am.
17The following day, 5 May 2010, he left home at 5 am as he had a doctor's appointment at Auburn. As he was walking to the appointment he saw a Commodore station wagon. It appeared that someone was sitting in the back seat. When he investigated he found that there was a tyre and a bumper bar in the back seat. He also noticed that the glove box was open. The driver's door was locked but the passenger's window was half-open which permitted him to open the door. When he noticed that the keys were in the ignition he got into the car and drove straight to his doctor's surgery at Auburn.
18The appellant arrived at the doctor's surgery before 7 am and waited for ten minutes until the surgery opened at 7 am.  He went in and was given the first appointment, which was not until 9 am, when the doctor was due to arrive. Having secured the first appointment, the appellant returned to the car and started investigating the contents of the glove box and the middle console. He noticed a bag on the floor and went through its contents. He did not, however, look under the driver's seat and accordingly neither saw nor touched the knife located there.
19The appellant saw the doctor, filled the prescription at a chemist across the road, returned to the car and drove away. He drove towards the city and stopped at McDonalds where he purchased food and drink.  He discarded a drinking straw in the car. He decided to leave the car at Warwick Farm station.  On the way it started to rain and he was involved in a car accident. A man, who said that his wife had also been involved in the accident, asked the appellant not to leave the scene. Another driver, who happened to be a police officer, asked him if he was all right. The appellant told him that he had to get out of there before the police arrived. The driver, who identified himself as a police officer, went to park his car. A bus pulled up and the appellant alighted. He left his jumper in the car. He lied to the bus driver when he said that he had not been involved in the accident.
20The appellant had lost a finger on his left hand when he was young.
The conduct of the trial by the appellant's counsel
21The appellant's trial counsel, in his cross-examination of Ms Ly, elicited the following:
a. She had first observed the offender only for a moment when he was at the fridge.  She then resumed her own work at a nearby oven and heard the offender ask Ms Dang about a pudding.  She thought nothing of it at that stage.
b. She was working at her oven and did not look at the offender again until Ms Dang yelled out that he had her bag, at which time she approached and tried to assist Ms Dang retrieve her bag.
c. She saw the offender produce the knife from his pocket and brandish it with his right hand.
d. The offender was not wearing gloves which made it more likely that the witnesses would notice if his left hand was missing one of the middle fingers.
e. The offender was wearing a grey zippered jacket and jeans.
f. The offender was pulling the bag with his left hand only and brandished the knife with his right hand.
g. When the knife was produced Ms Ly released the bag, the offender fled and Ms Ly and Ms Tung chased him outside and saw him get into the car which was parked immediately out the front of the bakery.
22The effect of this cross-examination was that Ms Ly accepted that she did not pay any particular attention to the offender until the struggle for the bag began. Given that the CCTV footage showed that the offender was on the bakery premises for only 79 seconds, her opportunity to observe the offender was, at best, transitory.  Her observation lasted a considerably shorter time and took place in very stressful, dynamic and potentially violent circumstances. Her view of the offender was predominantly either of the rear of his head or his profile, whereas the photo in the identification array was front-on.
23The appellant's trial counsel cross-examined Ms Dang to the effect that the man she recalled in the bakery had a small, healed cut on the tip of one of the middle fingers of his left hand. 
24In closing address the appellant's trial counsel relied on the facts that neither Ms Tung nor Ms Dang was able to identify any picture at all from the array and that Ms Lenhard identified someone other than the appellant. He sought to undermine the effect of Ms Ly's positive identification by emphasising that Ms Ly had sworn that the offender had brown eyes, whereas as a matter of objective fact, his eyes were green. He also submitted that her evidence was tainted because the police had informed her before she was shown the photographic array that they had a suspect in custody.  Trial counsel submitted that, had the man Ms Dang observed been the appellant, she would have noticed that part of a middle finger of his left hand was missing.
25The appellant's trial counsel also relied on the absence of any DNA or fingerprint evidence in the bakery that matched that of the appellant.
The parties' submissions26The appellant's primary submission was that there has been a miscarriage of justice because his trial counsel did not challenge Ms Ly's identification of the appellant in the photo array.  He submitted that this failure resulted in her identification of him being ""totally unchallenged"" and thereby deprived him of a real chance of acquittal.
27The appellant submitted that it was necessary for his counsel at trial, in order to challenge her identification of him in the photograph array to explore the following:(1)her level of confidence, which she expressed in chief as being ""90-95%"" and ""definitely"" the appellant;(2)the circumstances in which she had seen the appellant at the time of the offence, such as lighting, duration and her state of mind and the extent to which those circumstances could have undermined the reliability of her photo identification; and(3)differences between the photograph she identified and the description given by her, including features that she had described, such as grey hair, which were absent on the photograph selected.
28The appellant made no criticism of the extensive warnings given by the trial judge regarding picture identification but submitted that such warnings:"". . . were necessarily [given] in a vacuum because there was no evidence that [h]er Honour could actually refer to so as to illustrate the potential weakness of the evidence- length of time observation, lighting, the differences between the description in the photograph, state of mind at the time of the incident, or any questions as to the level of certainty that it was the same person.""
29The appellant invited this Court to proceed on the basis that the appellant had given no instructions relevant to this ground but submitted, in the alternative, that any such instructions would not have bound his trial counsel in any event. 
30The appellant's trial counsel was required to attend the hearing of this appellant in case evidence from him was required. However, the appellant did not seek to lead evidence from him on any matter pertinent to the determination of this application. 
Reasons
31This Court will intervene on the ground of incompetence of trial counsel only if such incompetence must have resulted in a miscarriage of justice. The principal issue is, accordingly, whether there has been a miscarriage of justice within s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, although a related issue also arises for determination: whether any incompetence has been shown.
32There will have been a miscarriage of justice if this Court considers that the alleged incompetence of counsel deprived the appellant of a chance of acquittal that was fairly open: TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124 (TKWJ).
33The content of the appellant's instructions at trial arises as a preliminary matter. The appellant chose at the hearing of his application not to adduce evidence as to his instructions, if any, on the question of picture identification. Accordingly, there is no basis on which this Court could conclude that the appellant had not instructed his counsel to take the course which was in fact taken. Indeed the absence of evidence leaves open the possibility that the appellant seeks to adopt a different approach to the issue of picture identification than that which he authorised at trial.
34The question whether there has been a miscarriage of justice is to be answered objectively: Nudd v The Queen [2006] HCA 9; 80 ALJR 614 at [27] per Gummow and Hayne JJ, citing TKWJ. Hayne J said in TKWJ,  in the context of an alleged failure, to call evidence: [107] . . . [W]hen it is said that a failure to call evidence which was available to the defence at trial has led to a miscarriage of justice, the question presented to an appellate court requires an objective inquiry, not an inquiry into the subjective thought processes of those who appeared for, or advised, the accused at trial. The relevant question is not: why did counsel not lead the evidence, or was counsel competent or incompetent? It is: could there be any reasonable explanation for not calling the evidence?[108] If there could not be any such explanation, there may have been a miscarriage of justice. It would then be necessary to go on to ask whether the jury would have been likely to entertain a reasonable doubt about guilt if the evidence had been led. If, however, there could be a reasonable explanation for not calling the evidence, that will be the end of the matter. It is not to the point then to inquire whether counsel did or did not think about the point, or acted competently or incompetently, even though the conclusion that there could be no reasonable explanation for the course followed at trial would seem to entail the conclusion that counsel did not act competently.
35It follows that the first question is whether there could be a reasonable explanation for trial counsel not directly cross-examining Ms Ly about the following matters:(1)her level of confidence, which she expressed in chief as being ""90-95%"" and ""definitely"" the appellant;(2)the circumstances in which she had seen the appellant at the time of the offence, such as lighting, duration and her state of mind and the extent to which those circumstances could have undermined the reliability of her photo identification; and(3)differences between the photograph she identified and the description given by her, including features that she had described, such as grey hair, which were absent on the photograph selected.
36The answer with respect to the first matter relied upon is self-evident. A cross-examiner who explored Ms Ly's level of certainty would inevitably run the risk that she would not only adhere to her evidence in chief but also that she would fortify it with further plausible reasons, which the jury might find compelling, as to why she was so sure that the photograph she selected was that of the accused.   I do not consider there to be any basis for the assumption that underpins the appellant's submission:  namely, that the evidence elicited or such a cross-examination would have been advantageous to him.  I am accordingly satisfied that there could be a reasonable and obvious explanation for trial counsel's not cross-examining directly about this topic.
37As to the second matter, I consider that trial counsel laid sufficient groundwork in his cross-examination of Ms Ly, Ms Tung and Ms Dang. The matters elicited from Ms Ly that are set out in [19] above formed the basis of the submission that Ms Ly's identification of the appellant was unreliable. I am unable to detect any incompetence in trial counsel's approach.  There could have been reasonable explanations for his approach, which was not in any way unorthodox.
38As to the third matter, it was not necessary for trial counsel to put the matter of the appellant's hair colour to Ms Ly in cross-examination. The discrepancy between the appellant's hair colour, as apparent to the jury in Court and as shown in the photograph Ms Ly selected on the one hand, and her description of its being grey on the other, would have been obvious to the jury. What the appellant's trial counsel did in closing address was to highlight the discrepancy in eye colour in the following passage:
You've seen the accused in the witness box.  What colour are his eyes?""They're green, they're green eyes, yet when Jenny Ly was asked about the description, page 39, line 5:'Q His eye colour? A Eye colour is brown eye colour.'Can't even get the eyes right.  The man's sitting across in the dock, still can't get the eyes right.""
39The art of advocacy, including jury advocacy, involves the art of selection. The force of a powerful point, such as ""she can't even get the eyes right"", can be undermined by a litany of lesser but similar instances. The fact that the grey hair was not mentioned in final address could be explained either by its being a lesser point to that of the eye colour; or, by its obviousness, which meant that trial counsel could safely leave the jury to draw its own conclusion about the weight to be given to Ms Ly's photo identification of the appellant. Either of these explanations could be a reasonable explanation for the trial counsel's conduct of the trial.
40In summary, I consider there could be reasonable explanations for each aspect the conduct of trial counsel said to amount to incompetence. In these circumstances, as Hayne J observed in the passage cited above from TKWJ at [108], that is the end of the matter.
41It follows that there is no prospect of there having been a miscarriage of justice such as would warrant this Court's intervention.

		24 May 2013",2013-05-23 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2706685,"R v BALL, Judd Ashton [2013] NSWCCA 126","Judgment
1MACFARLAN JA:  I agree with Hall J's reasons for judgment and the orders that he proposes.  In particular, I agree that a two year Intensive Correction Order was a manifestly inadequate sentence for the respondent's offence under s 86(2)(b) of the Crimes Act, bearing in mind the Form 1 offences to be taken into account and the objective seriousness of the respondent's conduct described in [93] to [100] of his Honour's judgment.
2HALL J:  The Crown appeals pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the sentence imposed upon the respondent in the District Court at Sydney on 13 June 2012.
3The respondent is aged 31 years.  He was charged on indictment with an offence contrary to s 86(2)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 that on 5 July 2009 at Northmead he took the female victim (the complainant), without her consent, with intent to obtain an advantage, namely to intimidate her and to have physical control over her and at the time of and immediately before the taking, actual bodily harm was occasioned to her.
4The maximum penalty for an offence under s 86(2) is 20 years imprisonment.  There is no standard non-parole period prescribed for such an offence.  The sentencing judge imposed a sentence of 2 years to be served by way of an intensive correction order pursuant to s 7 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to operate from 22 June 2012.
5The sentencing judge was required to also take into account on a Form 1, four matters, the first two of which, both individually and together, would require a significant increase in the sentence imposed for the principal offence.  The four matters were as follows:
(i) Assault occasioning actual bodily harm, contrary to s 59(1) of the Crimes Act (maximum penalty:  5 years imprisonment);
(ii) Use an offensive implement, namely a motor vehicle, with intent to commit an indictable offence, contrary to s 33B(1)(a) of the Crimes Act (maximum penalty:  12 years imprisonment);
(iii) Intentionally damaging property (namely a mobile phone) belonging to another person contrary to s 195(1)(a) of the Crimes Act (maximum penalty:  5 years imprisonment);
(iv) Take and drive motor vehicle without the permission of the owner, contrary to s 154A(1)(a)/117 of the Crimes Act (maximum penalty:  5 years imprisonment).
6The Crown additionally appeals pursuant to s 5DB of the Criminal Appeal Act against the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge for an offence of drive manner dangerous, contrary to s 42(2) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999.  The maximum penalty for that offence is 9 months imprisonment and/or a fine of 20 penalty units.  The offence also carries an automatic disqualification from holding a driver's licence for a period of 3 years, (and where if the court thinks fit, any shorter period of not less than 12 months:  s 180(2)(d) of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005).
7In respect of the lastmentioned offence the sentencing judge dealt with the matter pursuant to s 166-168 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.  His Honour convicted the respondent with no other penalty, pursuant to s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  The sentencing judge also reduced the automatic disqualification period of 3 years to the minimum of 12 months.
8The Notice of Appeal was signed by the Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions on 27 June 2012.  It was served upon the respondent on 3 July 2012.
9An Amended Notice of Appeal (identifying the correct statutory basis for the appeal in respect of the drive manner dangerous offence) was signed by the Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions on 15 November 2012 and it was served on the respondent's legal representatives on that date.
10The factual matters relevant to the charged offences and the Form 1 offences were set out in a document entitled ""Agreed Facts"" which formed part of Exhibit A that was tendered on sentence.
11The offence on the indictment and the offences on the Form 1 and the s 166 Certificate all occurred on 5 July 2009.
FACTS
12For the purposes of analysis the relevant facts may be considered as occurring at four stages.
Stage 1
13The complainant had been out with two friends and at about 1:30 am on 5 July 2009 attended a fast food restaurant at Church Street, Parramatta.  Following a meal the complainant endeavoured to start her car.  She was unsuccessful as the battery had gone flat.  She unsuccessfully sought help from friends and patrons at the restaurant.
14During the course of that day the complainant had received a number of text messages from the respondent with whom she had had a relationship which had recently come to an end.  She had not replied to the respondent's messages.  Not being able to raise any help from others to get her car started, she responded to his text messages by asking if he had any jumper leads.
15Prior to receiving a response the complainant accepted a lift to her home, having decided to leave her vehicle in the carpark until the following day.  On the way home the complainant received a text message from the respondent saying that he would bring jumper leads.  She responded by saying that she was being driven home by a friend.  When she got home the respondent rang her saying that he would come and pick her up.  Shortly after she reached her home a white utility arrived.  The complainant saw the respondent was in the passenger seat.  He told her to hurry up and that he had the jumper leads to go and fix the car.  The complainant got into the car and was driven back to the restaurant carpark.
16In due course, the complainant's car was started.  The respondent said that he would drive her car.  The driver of the other vehicle left.  The complainant did not want the respondent driving her car as she had formed the view that he had been drinking.  She ended up driving the car herself with the respondent in the front passenger seat.
17Whilst driving along Windsor Road the respondent began to say to her such things as, ""I bet you had a good night, where did you go?"".  Without any warning, he struck the complainant to the side of her face.  The complainant pulled the car over to the side of the road.
18At this point they were at the intersection of Windsor Road and Whitehaven Road, Northmead.  The complainant told the respondent to get out of her car.  The respondent put his hands up to her face and told her that he was really sorry.  The complainant again told him to get out but he refused.  He then struck her to the face with his right arm, pushed her face against the driver's side glass window and started pulling her hair.
19The respondent pushed the complainant against the door of the car and continued to push her face against the window.  This assault immediately resulted in bruising being occasioned to the complainant's face and forehead with an indentation to the left side of her forehead.  This conduct represented item 1 on the Form 1.  The relevant facts were set out at [10]-[11] of the Agreed Facts.
Stage 2
20The complainant managed to open her door and fell out of the car.  The respondent then climbed across into the driver's seat, closed the door and drove off.  The complainant took out her mobile phone and dialled triple-0 and began to speak to the operator.  She then saw her car being driven by the respondent rapidly in reverse towards her.
21In an attempt to avoid being struck by the reversing vehicle, the complainant jumped over a small brick fence.  The vehicle mounted the kerb, crossed the nature strip and struck the complainant on her arm.  This incident was the subject of item 2 on the Form 1 (it is referred to at [13] of the Agreed Facts.
22The respondent got out of the vehicle and approached the complainant who was screaming for help.  He began to hit her again.  He grabbed her by the hair and dragged her towards the car.  The complainant yelled, ""help, help somebody help"", and told the respondent to ""please stop please just leave me alone"".  Much of what was said at this time was recorded by the triple-0 operator.
Stage 3
23The respondent left the complainant on the ground, got back into the vehicle and moved it onto the roadway on the corner of Whitehaven Road and Windsor Road, Northmead.  He then got out of the vehicle and again approached the complainant.
24The complainant got off the ground, went around to the passenger side of the vehicle and attempted to lock herself in.  The respondent put his hand through the open window and opened the door.  He then grabbed her by the neck and hair and dragged her out of the vehicle.
25The respondent kneed the complainant in the stomach winding her and causing her to fall to the ground.  He then proceeded to kick her to the ribs and her buttocks.
26The complainant screamed, ""you're killing me"", to which the respondent replied ""oh yeah"" and kicked at her again.  
27The complainant begged him not to touch her and the respondent yelled at her: 
""... I'll fucking, I'll kill you ...I swear, I'll like kill you...I'll kill you...I don't give a fuck, you fuck it up... you think I fucking care about you...I don't fucking care.  You don't fucking love me.  You don't fucking love me.""  (Agreed Facts at [21]).
28The respondent then dragged the complainant by the hair over to the passenger side of the vehicle and forced her into the front passenger seat.  He then picked her up and attempted to force her body into the foot space of the passenger side of the vehicle.  The complainant was stuck in the corner of that space with her legs still hanging out of the vehicle.
Stage 4
29The respondent walked around to the driver's side of the vehicle, got into the driver's seat and started driving.  The taking of the complainant's vehicle is the subject of item 4 on the Form 1.  It is also referred to at [12]-[13] and [22] of the Agreed Facts.  The complainant pulled herself inside the vehicle and managed to close the door.
30By this stage, the complainant had also occasioned bruises to her side, back and buttocks, along with minor lacerations to her feet.
31A resident nearby the area where these assaults took place contacted triple-0 and reported what was happening.
32The respondent drove off in a northerly direction along Windsor Road at high speed.  The complainant said, ""please stop the car"", to which the respondent replied, ""no I'm going to crash it"".  The complainant repeatedly told the respondent to slow down or stop and that he was going to kill them both.  The respondent replied, ""good, I will kill you"", ""good I have nothing to lose"" and continued to repeat the words ""I'm gonna kill you, I'm going to crash the car, I don't care about you or anything"".
33At approximately 100 metres south of the intersection of the M2 Motorway, the vehicle driven by the respondent almost collided with the rear offside portion of a gold coloured sedan travelling in lane 1 of the motorway.  The respondent continued driving at high speed until he had reached the intersection of Cook Street.  He turned right at high speed, causing the rear of the vehicle to lose control and slide towards a telegraph pole on the western kerb of Cook Street, narrowly missing it.
34The respondent continued driving at high speed until he reached the intersection of James Street, Baulkham Hills.  He attempted to turn left but was travelling too fast and collided with a ""keep left"" sign on a median strip in the middle of James Street.  
35The respondent continued to drive to the top of James Street, where he pulled over to the right-hand side of the roadway and stopped the vehicle outside a unit complex near the intersection of Railway Street.  The respondent's manner of driving as set out in the preceding paragraphs gave rise to the offence of drive manner dangerous on the s 166 Certificate.  The Agreed Facts also deals with this aspect at [25]-[33].
36The complainant heard sirens and got out of the vehicle.  She was approached by a female.  She told the female to call the police.  The respondent drove the vehicle into the underground carpark of the unit complex where he remained for a short time, before he returned and approached the complainant and started pushing her and told her to come inside so they could talk.  The complainant noticed that the respondent was holding her mobile phone and she unsuccessfully attempted to recover it from him.  The respondent then walked back towards the unit complex.
37A male person, who happened to be known to the complainant, followed the respondent and asked him to return the complainant's phone.  The male returned with the phone and handed it to the complainant.
38The complainant again rang the triple-0 number and advised the operator of her location.  The respondent returned, started screaming at the complainant and tried to take the phone from her.  He managed to take the phone from her and threw it against a brick wall causing it to break into pieces.  He then walked over to the phone, picked up the pieces and threw them into nearby bushes.  The conduct in this respect is the subject of item 3 on the Form 1.  It is also referred to in the Agreed Facts at [39].
39The respondent approached the complainant and attempted to take her into the unit complex upon which she stated, ""there is no way I'm going inside"".
40At about 4:15 am, police arrived.  They observed the complainant to be shaking and crying.  She told police what had happened and was conveyed to Westmead Hospital for treatment of her injuries.
41The respondent was placed under arrest and taken to Castle Hill Police Station where he participated in an interview.  He denied assaulting the complainant or driving her vehicle.
THE SENTENCING PROCEEDINGS
42The sentence hearing commenced on 12 October 2010 on which date the Agreed Facts (Exhibit A) was tendered.  The proceedings were then stood over to 17 December 2010 but did not proceed on that date.
43The proceedings were adjourned to 29 April 2011, but did not proceed until 16 June 2011 on which date material, including medical reports and the report of a psychologist and other evidence was tendered.  The respondent also gave evidence on that date, as did his father.
44The proceedings were adjourned and were next listed for hearing on 19 August 2011.  The proceedings were again adjourned until 28 October 2011 and on that date the proceedings were adjourned until 15 December 2011.
45On 15 December 2011, the sentencing judge heard submissions from the parties and then adjourned until 8 June 2012.  The proceedings were next listed for hearing on 13 June 2012 and on that occasion the sentencing judge delivered his remarks on sentence.
46The sentencing judge set out in detail the relevant facts and referred to sentencing decisions in relation to offences under s 86(1)(b) of the Crimes Act.  These included Chaplin v R (2006) 160 A Crim R 85; R v Collett and Robson (Roden J, 7 June 1979, unreported); R v Newell [2004] NSWCCA 183.  His Honour stated:
""It is quite clear, on my appreciation of the cases, that non-custodial sentences will generally not be appropriate for an offence under s 86 particularly for an offence which is by way of the aggravated form such as the one here ...""  (ROS, 13 June 2012, at [17])
47His Honour noted that it was ""useful to assess the objective criminality of the offence against the following criteria""
""(i) the relationship of the offender, if any, to the victim.  
(ii) the mechanism by which the detention was achieved.
(iii) the purpose for which the victim was detained.
(iv) the harm or injury done to the victim.
(v) the circumstances in which the harm was inflicted, (a) in the course of detaining and/or (b) in the pursuance of the purpose of the detention.
(vi) the period or duration of the detention.
(vii) the holding place where the detention was affected.""
48His Honour proceeded to state that he found that the detention of the complainant had been for a matter of some minutes, that the detention was in the complainant's motor vehicle which was being driven by the respondent in a general direction towards her home and the respondent's home:  (ROS at [19]).
49His Honour then went on to deal with the personal and subjective factors concerning the respondent at ROS [20]-[22].  He noted that the respondent had been in a relationship with the complainant for seven years.  They had been apart for about a year when he came upon her in a shopping centre and the relationship recommenced.  However, it appears that the relationship then deteriorated.
50The sentencing judge referred to the report of Dr Westmore, consultant psychiatrist, who obtained a history that the respondent from the age of 19 years had commenced consuming alcohol and at that time he would consume between five and ten mixed drinks on a weekly basis.  From about 2006 his alcohol intake became excessive and at the time of the offence, and some time prior, he was drinking five to ten mixed drinks of alcohol three to four times a week.
51The sentencing judge then referred to the respondent's criminal record which included:
A charge of affray on 25 November 2006, dealt with at the Downing Centre Local Court on 7 February 2007, for which the respondent was fined the sum of $500.
On 18 February 2010 he was convicted at the Parramatta Local Court and fined in relation to a common assault.  This offence took place a few days before the offence for which he was being sentenced in the present proceedings.
On 8 February 2010 the respondent was dealt with at the Parramatta Local Court in relation to offences of entering a building with intent to commit an indictable offence for which he received 100 hours community service order, contravening an Apprehended Domestic Violence Order in respect of which he obtained a community service order of 100 hours and driving on a road whilst his licence was suspended for which he obtained a fine.
52Those offences, entering the building with intent to commit an indictable offence, the contravention of the Apprehended Violence Order and the driving offence all followed upon his arrest in relation to the offences the subject of the present proceedings.
53The sentencing judge noted that the respondent, at the time of the subject offences, had been trying to re-establish his relationship with the complainant.  She had been in a relationship with another person and it appeared that the respondent had been introduced to that other person a couple of days before the offence in question.
The Sentencing Remarks
54The sentencing judge concluded that in all of the circumstances the respondent's record was not such as to disentitle him to some leniency.  
55In his evidence, the respondent said that on the evening of the offence he had taken a drug Stilnox (one and a half tablets) which had been prescribed for him.  He had also consumed alcohol, including vodka, with a friend prior to committing the subject offences.  
56The sentencing judge observed:
""In all those circumstances, it seems first of all that the offender was not planning to see [the complainant] on the night.  Secondly, that when he went to see [the complainant] to assist her, he had no intention at that stage of doing anything other than either drive her home or be driven home and it seems that his involvement in offending developed on the way home as a result of discussions that he had with [the complainant].  They had a fairly fractured relationship over a period of time and things escalated very quickly.  I take into account that he was intoxicated at the time and more importantly, he was affected by Stilnox. ...""  (ROS at [30]).
57The sentencing judge noted that the respondent had shown contrition and remorse and that he had written a letter to the complainant in which he expressed his remorse.  He had continued to show contrition in relation to his offending which the sentencing judge said had been out of character.
58The sentencing judge brought into account the respondent's ingestion of alcohol and Stilnox on the night of the offences which it was found ""... did not assist his dealing with the situation that he found himself in"":  (ROS at [32]).
59He also noted in the remarks on sentence:
""... that the offender has had substantial psychological and psychiatric difficulties and it is quite clear from the material before me that he is doing something about them ..."" (ROS at [37]).
60Reference was also made to the reports of Dr Westmore and Dr Bernardi's report and the pre-sentence report dated 28 April 2011 following which the sentencing judge made a finding in these terms:
""In my view the offender's mental health at the time did contribute to the commission of the offence ...""  (ROS at [40]).
61His Honour then turned the question of sentence and concluded that it was appropriate that the sentence to be imposed be served by way of an Intensive Correction Order.  His Honour set out the reasons for doing so which included at [44]:
(i) The sentencing cases referred to in the remarks on sentence in relation to the range of offending for offences under s 86(2) of the Crimes Act ... ""and the facts as I have found them"".
(ii) Acceptance that the respondent had taken steps towards his rehabilitation beyond which a court usually sees.  In this respect reference was made to the reports of Dr Bernardi and Mr San Giovanni, psychologist, and the rehabilitation course undertaken by the respondent.
(iii) The respondent's genuine remorse and his insight and steps that he had taken to deal ""... with what was obviously a personal problem producing serious criminal behaviour ..."".  
62The sentencing judge then proceeded to impose a sentence of 2 years to be served by the intensive correction order pursuant to s 7 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
GROUNDS OF APPEAL
63The Crown relied upon seven grounds of appeal as follows:
""GROUND 1: His Honour failed to impose a sentence that reflected the objective seriousness of the offence.
GROUND 2: His Honour erred in ordering that the sentence be served by way of an intensive correction order.
GROUND 3: His Honour failed to impose a sentence that properly reflected the taking into account of the four matters on the Form 1 document.
GROUND 4: The weight his Honour afforded the respondent's subjective case impermissibly ameliorated the appropriate sentence.
GROUND 5: His Honour erred in the manner in which he took into account the mental illness of the applicant.
GROUND 6: His Honour erred in disposing of the offence of drive manner dangerous by convicting the respondent without imposing any other penalty pursuant to s 10A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999.
GROUND 7: His Honour erred in imposing sentences that are manifestly inadequate.""
64I will deal with the grounds below:
Ground 1:  His Honour failed to impose a sentence that reflected the objective seriousness of the offence.
Ground 2: His Honour erred in ordering that the sentence be served by way of an intensive correction order.
Ground 3:  His Honour failed to impose a sentence that properly reflected the taking into account of the four matters on the Form 1 document.
Submissions
65These grounds are related and they were dealt with together in submissions.
Crown Submissions
66The Crown's submission was that the offence under s 86(2), the aggravated form of the kidnapping offence, was objectively serious but that the sentence imposed failed to reflect that fact.  This position was said to be compounded by the failure by the sentencing judge to properly take into account the Form 1 offences.
67As to the nature of the offence, the Crown submitted that the statutory scheme recognises that a kidnapping offence where the victim sustains actual bodily harm in the context of the offence is more serious and that the threshold for ""actual bodily harm"" is relatively low and may typically involve bruising and scratching being examples of actual bodily harm.  In the present case, it was observed that the actual bodily harm was inflicted both immediately before or at the time the kidnapping offence occurred and following the respondent's actions in having driven the motor vehicle in reverse towards the complainant.
68His actions in grabbing the complainant by the neck and hair and dragging her out of the vehicle, kneeing her in the stomach, causing her to fall to the ground and then kicking her to her ribs and buttocks were said to have constituted actual bodily harm.
69The fact that the respondent took control of the vehicle and drove off whilst the complainant's legs were still hanging out of the vehicle and then drove at high speed despite numerous protestations by the complainant to slow down, and the continued driving at dangerously high speeds whilst telling the complainant that he was going to kill her and crash the car, were all said to indicate or confirm the seriousness of the offence.  The effects upon the complainant were said to include:  bruising to her side, back and buttocks and minor lacerations to her feet, and the terrifying experience to which the complainant was subjected.
70The Crown contended that the respondent's conduct was brutal, cowardly and inexcusable and that the experience could only be described as fearful and terrifying so far as the complainant was concerned.  Those factors, it was contended, were not ameliorated by the fact that the length of the detaining was ""a matter of some minutes"" or something in the region of 2 kms as found by the sentencing judge.
71The Crown referred to the decision of this Court in R v Hamid (2006) 165 A Crim R 179; [2006] NSWCCA 302 at [65]-[88].  In that case, Johnson J made a number of general observations concerning sentencing for domestic violence offences, which emphasise the exercise of power and control over the victim in domestic violence situations.  In that context, both specific and general deterrence are important factors in sentencing, as is the need for denunciation of such conduct and the need to recognise the harm done to the victim and the community consequent upon crimes of domestic violence.
72The Crown referred to the observations of Spigelman CJ in Attorney General's Application under ss 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No 1) [2002] NSWCCA 518; (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 which emphasises the need in taking into account matters on a Form 1 to impose a longer sentence than would have been imposed if the primary offence had stood alone.  Additionally, as the Chief Justice there observed, it is wrong to suggest that the additional penalty should be small, sometimes it will be substantial.
73The Crown accepted that not all offences on a Form 1 should ordinarily result in discernable increases in the sentence.  However, the respondent's conduct in driving the motor vehicle rapidly in reverse at the complainant, causing her to jump over a small brick wall to avoid being struck, the fact that the vehicle mounted the kerb, crossed the nature strip and struck the complainant's arm, were factors which operate to increase the objective seriousness of the principal offence.
74It was submitted that both individually and collectively the matters on the Form 1 should have resulted in a discernable and significant increase in the sentence imposed for the principal offence.
Submissions on Behalf of the Respondent
75In her written submissions on behalf of the respondent, Ms Manuell SC emphasised the following matters:
(i) Duration of the Detention
The period over which the offence took place was said to be relevantly short and the distance was only 2-3 kms.
(ii) The Extent of Fear or Terror Occasioned
It was accepted that the victim was terrified by the respondent's driving and that her terror was exacerbated by the respondent's demeanour and words spoken at the time.
(iii) The Purpose of the Detention
It was submitted that it would appear that there was no rational purpose for the detention other than for the respondent to take the victim back to the home they had shared.
(iv) The Extent (if any) to which Third Parties were Subjected to Ordeal or Anguish by Reason of Fear for the Welfare of the Victim
There was said to be no evidence of any third parties being subjected to such matters.
(v) Premeditation
It was submitted that the offence was not pre-planned.  The respondent had not been expecting to see the victim on the night of the offences and only did so when she phoned him late at night because of the problem with the car battery.
After he attended and the battery was recharged, and whilst the victim was driving the respondent home, the respondent asked her questions about where she had been that night.
Unlike many aggravated kidnapping offences, the s 86(2) offence in this case was said to be spontaneous.
(vi) Nature of the Injuries Sustained
Whilst the statements by the victim in the Victim Impact Statement were acknowledged, there was no medical evidence or photographs of the victim's injuries tendered in the sentencing proceedings.
76It was accepted, however, that the victim would have been greatly traumatised by the offence.
(vii) Domestic Relationship
Whilst it was acknowledged that the offence was committed in the course of a domestic relationship which is a matter capable of being an aggravating circumstance, it was submitted that this should not aggravate the seriousness of the s 86(2) offence in this case.  A number of stressors affecting the respondent had existed before the offence as detailed in the submissions.  These included a serious car accident in which both the respondent and victim had been involved, the victim's miscarriage and the separation of the respondent's parents and the death of the complainant's father.
The various problems that existed, it was submitted, placed the offences in the context of a disintegrating relationship where issues of jealousy, anger and mixed messages had not surprisingly arisen.
(viii) Seriousness of the Offence
It was submitted that although the s 86(2) offence was a serious offence because of the dangerousness of the respondent's driving and the terror the victim experienced, its objective gravity was said to be limited by its spontaneity, its short duration, the respondent voluntarily ceasing the offence, the destination (being a place the victim knew and from which she could obtain assistance), the relatively minor physical injuries inflicted on the victim and the earlier difficulties in the relationship.
77In relation to Ground 3 it was submitted for the respondent that the s 86(2) offence and the Form 1 offences were all part of the same incident and the principle of totality applied.
78Whilst the offences under ss 59(1) and 33B(1)(a) (being offences 1 and 2 on the Form 1) no doubt contributed to the victim's terror on the night, it was observed that the offences took place over minutes and not longer.
79In relation to the offence under s 154A(1)(a), the submission for the respondent was that it was integral to the s 86(2) offence on the basis that it concerned the respondent driving the complainant's car.  It was also submitted that the offence under s 195(1)(a) was a significantly lesser offence in which a fine would ordinarily be an appropriate penalty imposed in the Local Court.
80It was submitted that the sentencing judge had given careful consideration to all of the circumstances, both objective and subjective, of the entirety of the respondent's offending behaviour.  The sentence imposed in respect of the s 86(2) offence was said to be one which properly punished the whole of his behaviour whilst affording him the opportunity for rehabilitation.
CONSIDERATION
81The offence of kidnapping is the subject of Division 14 of Part 3 - Offences against a person.  Section 86 is concerned with three categories of kidnapping offences.  The first deals with the ""basic offence"" of kidnapping by a person who takes or detains a person, without the person's consent:
""(a) with the intention of holding the person to ransom, or 
(ai) with the intention of committing a serious indictable offence, or
(b) with the intention of obtaining any other advantage.""
82An offence under s 86(1) attracts a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment.
83The second category is the aggravated form of the offence:  s 86(2).  Under that provision a person is guilty of an offence if:
(a) the person commits an offence under sub-section (1) in the company of another person or persons, or
(b) the person commits an offence under sub-section (1) and at the time of, or immediately before or after, the commission of the offence, actual bodily harm is occasioned to the alleged victim.
84The maximum penalty for the aggravated form of the offence is imprisonment for 20 years.  
85The third form of the offence is the specially aggravated offence.  Under s 86(3) a person is guilty of an offence if the person commits an offence under sub-section (1) in the company of another person or persons and where at the time of, or immediately before or after, the commission of the offence, actual bodily harm is occasioned to the alleged victim.
86The maximum penalty for such an offence is a term of imprisonment for 25 years.
87The facts as set out above, establish that the offender committed a series of assaults upon the complainant immediately before and during the detention, certain of which occasioned actual bodily harm.  In addition, the complainant was severely traumatised by the experience to which she was subjected.
88The factors which bear upon the assessment of the seriousness of an offence under s 86 include:
""... the circumstances of the detention ...""  R v Speechley [2012] NSWCCA 130 at [55] per Johnson J with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Hammerschlagg J agreed.
89The act of unlawfully detaining a person in a motor vehicle whilst it is driven at high speed and otherwise in a reckless manner, needless to say, adds a very serious dimension to the gravity of the offence.  
90Whilst the sentencing judge set out a series of ""criteria"" by which the 'objective criminality' of the offence was to be assessed, only three factors were specifically discussed in relation to the objective circumstances.  The first was the duration of the detention which his Honour observed to have been ""for a matter of some minutes"".  The second was the fact that the detention occurred in the complainant's vehicle (at [19]).  The third was the fact that the respondent had not been planning to see the complainant on the night in question and did not have any intention of doing anything when he went to see her other than to drive her home.
91The offending conduct, his Honour noted, developed ""on the way home as a result of discussions that he had with [the complainant] ..."" (at [30]).
92The Agreed Facts, however, simply records that the respondent began to speak to the complainant saying such things as ""I bet you had a good night, where did you go?"":  see para [17] above.
93There was no discussion or evident consideration by the sentencing judge of the following circumstances each of which is relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence under s 86(2).  
(i) The unlawful detention began with the respondent dragging the complainant by the hair over the passenger side of the vehicle and then attempting to force her into the foot space of the passenger seat, followed by him taking control of the vehicle and driving off with the complainant's legs outside of the vehicle.
(ii) The use of the vehicle as a means of effecting the unlawful detention and exposing the complainant to an objectively high risk of serious physical injury.
(iii) The combination of assaults upon the complainant by the respondent, after he stopped the vehicle.
(iv) Notwithstanding that the offence lasted for ""a matter of minutes"", the complainant's unlawful detention whilst the vehicle was driven by the respondent at high speed and in reckless manner, with the respondent making statements to the effect that he would kill her, subjected the complainant to a terrifying experience.  
94In Regina v Collett and Robson (Court of Criminal Appeal, 7 June 1979, unreported) Roden J stated:
""... a second consideration will be the extent to which fear or terror may be occasioned in the detainee, how he or she is treated and what may be required of him or her by the captors ...""
95Although Roden J was addressing the statutory offence of aggravating kidnapping in company contrary to s 86(2)(a) of the Crimes Act, the above observation equally applies to this case.
96The complainant's Victim Impact Statement was before the sentencing judge.  It was tendered without objection although, as noted in the written submissions for the respondent, it was in inadmissible form.  However, be that as it may, it recorded the psychological trauma experienced during and subsequent to the offences committed by the respondent.  Although the sentencing judge must have been aware of the Statement's contents, no specific reference was made to the impact of the unlawful detention had upon the complainant as detailed in her Statement.  In particular, his Honour did not record any assessment by him of the significance of the physical and psychological effects of the offences upon the complainant.
97The objective seriousness of the detention was increased by the fact that after forcibly dragging and placing the complainant within the passenger side of the vehicle she was effectively entrapped in a vehicle then driven at high speed.  Those circumstances added significantly to the trauma of the detention.  
98The respondent, once having placed the complainant in a vulnerable position, then set about abusing the power and control that he held over her by subjecting her to the danger to which I have referred.  The abuse of power and control in offences involving domestic violence has been recognised as an aggravating factor:  R v Hamid [2006] NSWCCA 302 at [67]-[78] per Johnson J.  In R v Glen (Court of Criminal Appeal, 10 December 1994, unreported) Simpson J also stressed the importance of general deterrence in cases of domestic violence.  By reason of the prior relationship that had existed between the respondent and the complainant in the present case, the violence of the respondent, occurring as it did in a domestic-type setting, was a factor relevant to the objective seriousness of the offending conduct.
99I have earlier set out the Crown's submission in which it was contended that the respondent's conduct immediately before and during the detention amounted to a serious aggravation of the offence and that it could be properly characterised as ""brutal, cowardly and inexcusable"".  I, with respect, accept that description as entirely apposite and as conveying the gravity of the respondent's conduct.
100In summary, the matters that were relevant in the assessment of the gravity of the offence included the following:
(i) The assaults upon the complainant by the respondent immediately before the commission of the offence;
(ii) The respondent's actions in detaining the complainant in the motor vehicle and then driving it at high speed.
(iii) The respondent's statements directed at the complainant whilst driving at high speed referred to in paragraph [32] above (""good, I will kill you""...""I'm gonna kill you, I'm going to crash the car, I don't care about you or anything"").
(iv) The fact that the complainant was subjected to a serious risk of injury whilst the respondent was driving the vehicle in a reckless manner including losing control of it and allowing it to slide, narrowly missing a telegraph pole.
101The presence or absence of a particular type of advantage within s 86(1) does not mean that the presence or absence of the same is decisive in a determination of the seriousness of the particular offence before the Court:  R v Newell [2004] NSWCCA 183 per Howie J at [32], Bell and Hislop JJ agreeing.
102The respondent's plea, of course, indicates an acceptance that he did act with the intention of obtaining an advantage.  As in Newell, supra, it is clear in this case that he detained the complainant intending to obtain an advantage for himself, whatever that advantage might have been:  at [33].
103The offence committed under s 86(2), in my opinion, required appropriate denunciation and punishment consistent with the provisions of s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  
104In relation to the matters on the Form 1, as earlier indicated, the first and second items on the Form 1 were significant.  Whilst the sentencing judge noted that the Form 1 matters should impinge upon the sentence for the principal offence, as the Crown observed, it is unclear from his Honour's remarks on sentence, what impact he intended that the matters on the Form 1 should have on the ultimate sentence to be imposed.
105In Attorney General's Application Under S 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No 1) [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146, Spigelman CJ formulated a number of propositions as to the process for taking into account matters on a Form 1.  They included:
(i) That the entire point of the process is to impose a longer sentence (or to alter the nature of the sentence) than would have been imposed if the primary offence had stood alone.
(ii) It is wrong to suggest that the additional penalty should be small.  Sometimes it will be substantial.
(iii) The relevant authorities focus on the sentence that is appropriate for the charge on the indictment, with a view to increasing it by reason of the Form 1 offences for which guilt has been admitted:  at [18]-[19].
106In addition, the Chief Justice observed:
""... although a court is sentencing for a particular offence, it takes into account the matters for which guilt has been admitted, with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence.  The court does so by giving greater weight to two elements which are always material in the sentencing process.  The first is the need for personal deterrence, which the commission of the other offences will frequently indicate, ought to be given greater weight by reason of the course of conduct in which the accused has engaged.  The second is the community's entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences when there are other offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed.  These elements are entitled to greater weight than they may otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence.  There are matters which limit the extent to which this is so.  The express provision in s 33(3) referring to the maximum penalty of the primary offence is one.  The principle of totality is another.""  (At [42]).
107The first matter on the Form 1, as set out above, was ""assault occasioning actual bodily harm, contrary to s 59(1) of the Crimes Act (maximum penalty:  5 years imprisonment"".
108The facts concerning the respondent's assaults upon the complainant have been set out earlier.  Striking the complainant to the face with his right arm, pulling her hair, pushing her against the door of the vehicle and her face against the window, resulting in bruising to the complainant's face and forehead, indicates that the assaults cannot be regarded as trivial or of no consequence.  Although not at the high end of the range, they were nonetheless significant and ought to have been reflected in the sentence imposed.
109In relation to item 2 on the Form 1 involving the respondent rapidly reversing the vehicle towards the complainant causing her to jump over the small brick fence and striking her on the arm, that involved a serious offence, involving a motor vehicle and ought to have been reflected in the sentence imposed.
110The latter offence under s 33B(1)(a) of the Crimes Act attracted, as noted above, a maximum penalty of 12 years imprisonment.
111I accept the Crown's submission that the actual sentence imposed bespeaks error.  Although his Honour adverted to the need to take into account the matters on the Form 1, the sentence imposed, in my opinion, does not reflect a sentence that properly took into account items 1 and 2 on the Form 1.  Accordingly, Ground 3 has been established.
112Ground 1, failure to impose a sentence that reflected the objective seriousness of the offence, in my opinion has been made out.
113I have also concluded that the sentencing judge erred, in terms of Ground 2, in ordering that the sentence be served by way of an Intensive Correction Order.  I do not consider that the service of the term of imprisonment by Intensive Correction Order imposed by the sentencing judge was commensurate with the offence.
114The general principles in relation to Intensive Correction Orders were the subject of consideration in R v Tannous; R v Fahda; R v Dibb [2012] NSWCCA 243 by Basten JA at [11] to [25].  See also R v Pogson; R v Lapham; R v Martin [2012] NSWCCA 225 at [96]-[100].
115In Tannous Basten JA observed that the service of a sentence by way of Intensive Correction in the community is a more lenient penalty than full-time imprisonment, a fact that was acknowledged by the parties in that case, although there have been differing views expressed as to the degree of leniency involved:  see in this respect R v Boughen; R v Cameron [2012] NSWCCA 17 at [111] and Whelan v R [2012] NSWCCA 147 at [120].
116Intensive Correction Orders are, of course, a form of imprisonment and have been treated as having a significant punitive effect.  However, it is necessary to consider the nature of the offence in question in each case and the relevant circumstances concerning the objective seriousness of the offence in determining whether such an order is appropriate.
117The aggravated form of the kidnapping offence under s 86(2) Crimes Act carries, as earlier indicated, a maximum penalty of imprisonment of 20 years.  In a case such as the present where the aggravating factor is actual bodily harm caused by acts immediately prior to and/or during the detention, and in which the victim is subject to psychological trauma in a motor vehicle driven at high speed and in a reckless manner it is apparent that the gravity of such an offence is significant.  Taking into account all of the objective factors to which I have earlier referred concerning the offending in the present case, I have concluded, as earlier indicated, that the imposition of an Intensive Correction Order is not an appropriate form of punishment.  In particular, it does not sufficiently address the issue of general deterrence in a case of this kind.  
Ground 4:  The weight his Honour afforded the respondent's subjective case impermissibly ameliorated the appropriate sentence
Ground 5:  His Honour erred in the manner in which he took into account the mental illness of the applicant
118These two grounds were argued together.
119The Crown accepted that the respondent was able to demonstrate persuasive subjective circumstances, particularly in terms of his rehabilitation, but it was submitted that the sentencing judge's attention to the subjective considerations resulted in inadequate weight being given to the objective circumstances of the case.  
120It is well established that there ought to be a reasonable proportionality between a sentence and the circumstances of the crime:  R v Geddes (1936) 36 SR (NSW) 554 at 556 per Jordan CJ and R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354 per Gleeson CJ, Lee CJ at CL and Hunt J.
121In the latter case, the court observed that it is always important in seeking to determine the sentence appropriate to a particular crime to have regard to the gravity of the offence viewed objectively, for without such an assessment the other factors requiring consideration in order to arrive at a proper sentence to be imposed cannot be given their place.
122The issue raised by Grounds 4 and 5, raise for consideration the question as to whether or not the sentence imposed reflects inadequate weight having been attached to the objective circumstances of the offending.  The Crown referred to the fact that the sentencing judge found that the respondent's mental health at the time ""contributed"" to the commission of the offence.  The Crown, however, also observed that his Honour did not appear to go so far as to find that the respondent acted without knowledge of what he was doing or the gravity of his actions.  This, the Crown noted, was understandable given that the offence the respondent pleaded guilty to is an offence of specific intent:  s 428B Crimes Act.
123Dr Westmore, forensic psychiatrist, examined the respondent on 5 April 2011 and provided a report dated 11 April 2011 (Exhibit 1).
124He obtained a family history from the respondent which included the fact that in May 2006 he and the complainant had been involved in a serious motor vehicle accident after which he believed that both he and the complainant developed a range of psychiatric symptoms.  The respondent said that, in particular, he suffered flashbacks.  The history was that he had suffered similar symptoms when he was in year 12 and had been the victim of an armed hold-up when working in a video store.
125He was treated with antidepressants and prescribed Stilnox because he was having problems sleeping after the motor vehicle accident.
126The history was that although he was working full-time in the finance industry he had become depressed in mood and in due course his relationship with the complainant deteriorated.  In September 2006, the complainant had a miscarriage, which caused further strain on the relationship.  The history was that they separated around May 2007 but initially remained in contact.  After some 13 months they met accidentally in a shopping centre and their relationship recommenced.
127By early 2009, he was drinking to excess and he had been resorting to alcohol.  The relevant history included the fact that one or two months before the offence on 5 July 2009 the respondent heard that the complainant was having a relationship with another man.
128On the night of the offence, he and a friend had shared a bottle of vodka and he had also taken two tablets of Stilnox.
129Dr Westmore opined that the respondent had suffered episodes of depression and had previously been diagnosed as having a Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.
130As at July 2009, he was depressed and abusing alcohol quite heavily.
131A report by Dr Bernardi, psychiatrist, stated that she had examined the respondent on 14 June 2011 and considered that he suffered from major depression and would benefit from an antidepressant medication as well as counselling.  She stated that the combination of alcohol abuse and Stilnox had led to pathological intoxication and contributed to the assault which occurred against a background of a dysfunctional relationship.
132A psychologist report by Mr Sirgiovanni dated 19 April 2011 was tendered at the sentence hearing (Exhibit 3).  Mr Sirgiovanni expressed the opinion that the respondent suffered from a mixed anxiety and depressive disorder.
133Finally, a report of Professor Graham A Starmer (Exhibit 4) expressed the view that the respondent's consumption of a substantial amount of alcohol and a dose of Stilnox was capable of influencing the respondent's behaviour in an emotionally charged situation. 
134On analysis it is clear that there was little by way of evidence that established that the respondent acted without knowing what he was doing at the time of the offences, or that he had no appreciation or knowledge of the gravity of his actions.  As the Crown observed, having consumed Stilnox and a large quantity of alcohol he was able to demonstrate a presence of mind to contact another friend to drive him to meet the complainant and then take them to the complainant's car.
135Upon arrest, the respondent was able to take part in an ERISP where he denied that he had assaulted the complainant or driven her vehicle.
136The evidence establishes a history of the respondent having previously combined Stilnox with excessive quantities of alcohol.  Although there was a history of depression and that his consumption of alcohol and Stilnox may have exacerbated it, I do not consider that the evidence as to the respondent's mental health substantially reduced his culpability.
137In the circumstances to which I have referred, and taking into account the subjective case presented on behalf of the respondent, I consider that the sentence imposed was disproportionate to the objective gravity of the offence.
138Accordingly, I consider that Ground 5 should be upheld.
Ground 6:  His Honour erred in disposing of the offence of drive manner dangerous by convicting the respondent without imposing any other penalty pursuant to s 10A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999
139Although the offence attracted a maximum penalty of only 9 months imprisonment and/or a fine of 20 penalty units, the circumstances of the offence did, in my opinion, require a penalty to be imposed.
140The relevant factors include the respondent driving at a high speed over a distance in a built-up residential area in a manner which led to him losing control of the vehicle, at one point narrowly missing another motor vehicle and later colliding with a traffic sign.  Clearly, the potential for danger in the circumstances was high both to the complainant and to other members of the public.
141The sentencing judge stated:
""... in all the circumstances and taking into account his driving record and taking into account the sentence that I have already imposed I deem it inappropriate to impose any penalty but I convict him and I disqualify him for a period, which is the minimum period of 6 months"" (later corrected to the statutory minimum of 12 months).
142The sentencing judge did not elaborate as to why he considered it ""inappropriate"" to impose ""any"" penalty.  The offence was clearly a serious offence of its kind.  I accept the submission made on behalf of the Crown that it warranted more than just recording of a conviction without penalty.
143The fact that the sentencing judge had imposed a sentence for the offence under s 86(2) did not provide a sufficient basis for not imposing any penalty.  His Honour, of course, was required to consider, inter alia, the objective seriousness of the offence and to impose a sentence and then proceed to determine matters of concurrency and accumulation.  This his Honour failed to do.
144I accordingly am of the opinion that Ground 6 should be upheld.
Ground 7:  His Honour erred in imposing sentences that are manifestly inadequate
145This ground has essentially been addressed in discussion of the other grounds relied upon by the Crown.
146Given the seriousness of the offence under s 86(2) of the Crimes Act I do not consider that a two year Intensive Correction Order was sufficient to punish the respondent and denounce his conduct.  The objective seriousness of the offence could not, in my assessment, be regarded as at the low end of the range for such offences.  The imposition of an Intensive Correction Order did not give sufficient effect to general or specific deterrence.
147On the hearing, evidence was given which indicated that the respondent has made significant progress towards rehabilitation and has secured ongoing employment and his personal life has stabilised.
148The Crown has submitted that this is an appropriate case for the Court to exercise its discretion under s 5D(1) and s 5DB(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act to vary the sentences imposed and to impose such other sentence or sentences as the Court considers proper.
149I have concluded, notwithstanding the strong subjective circumstances established by the respondent, that the objective seriousness of the s 86(2) offence and items 1 and 2 on the Form 1 required the imposition of a sentence involving a term of full-time custodial imprisonment.  
TOTALITY
150The respondent's offending conduct occurred over one period in the early hours of 5 July 2009.  It may be considered in terms of three categories of offending:
(i) The assaults occurring before the unlawful detention of the complainant.
(ii) The unlawful detention of the complainant during which she was assaulted.
(iii) The driving of the motor vehicle in a dangerous manner, including at high speed.
151In relation to the latter offence under s 42(2) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999, the potentiality of danger associated with driving at such a speed in a residential area is apparent.  The Crown submitted that, objectively, it was a serious example of an offence under that provision which warranted more than just the recording of a conviction without penalty.
152As I have already indicated, the sentencing judge was required, in my opinion, to determine and impose a sentence which reflected the objective seriousness for that offence.  He was then required to consider whether the sentence should have been served concurrently or cumulatively with the other sentences in order to arrive at an appropriate sentence that reflected the total criminality of the respondent:  Pearce v R (1998) 194 CLR 610.
153I am of the opinion that by taking into account, in determining the sentence for the offence under s 86(2) of the Crimes Act, the seriousness of the dangerous manner in which the respondent drove the vehicle as an aggravating factor in the determination of sentence for that offence, the sentence required to be imposed in respect of the offence under s 42(2) of the Roads Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act ought to be wholly concurrent with the sentence to be imposed for the offence under s 86(2) of the Crimes Act.
DISCRETION
154The Court has a discretion to decline to interfere, even when satisfied that the sentence is manifestly inadequate:  Criminal Appeal Act, s 5D(1); Green v R; Quinn v R [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [1] and [24].
155Ms Manuell SC on behalf of the respondent submitted that, should error be found, the Court should exercise its discretion not to intervene.  In that respect it was observed that, as at the date of the hearing of the appeal, three and a half years had past since the respondent committed the subject offences.  After he was charged, it was noted he was on bail and reporting to the police three times a week for a period of nearly three years before sentence.
156Since being charged he has:
(i) Obtained and maintained employment;
(ii) Established a new and healthier relationship;
(iii) Re-established a supportive relationship with both of his parents;
(iv) He has been required to submit to regular urinalysis since sentence and has not failed any such testing; and
(v) He has undergone psychiatric and psychological treatment for his depression.
157It was further noted on his behalf that, since being sentenced, the respondent has complied with all of the conditions of his Intensive Correction Order and become a parent for the first time.
158It was submitted that the respondent is, effectively, well on his way to full rehabilitation.  The sentences imposed on the respondent, it was submitted, had achieved, or continued to achieve, all of the purposes of sentencing set out in s 34 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
159The particular matters to which attention has been drawn as set out in paragraph [156] above are very important matters to be taken into account in determining whether the residual exercise should be exercised.  Additionally, the issue of delay itself and anxiety and distress arising from the appellate process are all matters to be considered.
160There is no doubt that the period of time taken during the sentencing process in the District Court was both substantial and unusual and is regrettable indeed.  It is to be considered in the context of the further delay that has arisen through the hearing and disposition of the Crown appeal.
161The respondent relied, in the event of re-sentencing, upon his own affidavit declared and affirmed on 19 November 2012 as well as the affidavit of Vanessa York affirmed on 13 November 2012.  That evidence supports the matters to which I have referred in paragraph [156].  
162Balanced against the matters to which I have referred is the need to consider, in the context of the present case, the purposes of sentencing as stated in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which are expressed to include:
(a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence.
(b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences.
(c) to protect the community from the offender, 
(d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender.
(e) to make the offender accountable for his or her actions,
(f) to denounce the conduct of the offender,
(g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.
163Whilst the evidence establishes that the offender has, to date, successfully achieved milestones in his progress towards rehabilitation there is a need for the matters referred to in sub-paragraphs (a), (b), (e), (f) and (g) to be considered.
164Each of the matters set out above has required careful consideration be given to whether or not this Court should intervene.  Having regard to the full circumstances of the offending and to the leniency of the sentences imposed I consider that the case is not an appropriate one in which to decline to intervene.  
165In re-sentencing the respondent, it is necessary to determine what allowance should be made for the time served ""in the community"".  On one view, as the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge was one of imprisonment, the circumstances of the imprisonment should be disregarded and the respondent should be allowed credit for the whole of the term served.
166I have determined that an appropriate starting point is 3 years 6 months imprisonment.
167The respondent pleaded guilty on the first day of his trial.  Before the sentencing judge the Crown had submitted that the maximum appropriate discount to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea should be no greater than 15%.  The sentencing judge determined that the sentencing discount for the plea should be 15%.
168On re-sentencing, allowing for a discount of 15% would result in a sentence of 2 years and 11 months.  On the basis of the respondent's age and the evidence as to his good rehabilitation prospects I consider a finding of special circumstances is appropriate in the present case and I accordingly make such a finding.  On that basis the statutory ratio of the non-parole period to the balance of term will be varied and will be reflected in the re-sentencing orders proposed.
169On the above basis I am of the opinion that the respondent should be re-sentenced in relation to the offence under s 86(2) upon the basis of a non-parole period of 1 year 6 months to commence on 22 June 2012 with a balance of term of 1 year 5 months to expire on 21 May 2015.  Time served under the Intensive Correction Order is to count as part of the sentence to be imposed under the re-sentencing orders.
170The respondent should be sentenced to a fixed period of 6 months in respect of the offence committed by him under s 42(2) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999, such sentence to be wholly concurrent with the sentence to be imposed with respect to the offence under s 86(2) of the Crimes Act 1900.
171The respondent has been convicted of the offence charged under s 42(2) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999 by the order made by the District Court on 13 June 2012.  The sentencing judge also made an order under s 188(2)(d)(ii) of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005 disqualifying the respondent from holding a driver licence for a period of 12 months.  
172This lastmentioned order, however, was not specifically identified or referred to in the Grounds of Appeal, although there was reference to it in the Crown's written submissions at [80] and in the respondent's written submissions at [52].
173The Crown's submission that the Court should vary the ""sentence"" the subject of the appeal under s 5DB of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 does not, in my opinion, with sufficient specificity, identify the s 188(2)(d)(i) order as part of the appeal brought by it under s 5DB, although the terms of that section having regard to the definition of ""sentence"" in s 2(1) of the Act, may have application to such an order.  In those circumstances I do not consider, by reason of procedural fairness and discretionary considerations, that this Court should interfere with the order shortening the ""automatic disqualification"" specified in the lastmentioned order.
174The action taken by the sentencing judge in not imposing a penalty in respect of the offence under s 42(2) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act is taken to be, for the purpose of the Criminal Appeal Act, a sentence passed by the court on the conviction of the offence:  s 10A(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
175Accordingly, the appeal under s 5DB in these proceedings concerns only the sentencing judge's action in not imposing a penalty as noted above.  That ""sentence"" in that respect should be set aside in accordance with the re-sentencing orders I propose.
RE-SENTENCING ORDER
176I propose the following orders:
(1) Appeal by the Crown upheld.
(2) The sentences imposed by Jeffreys DCJ in the District Court on 13 June 2012 be set aside.
(3) The respondent, in respect of the offence contrary to s 86(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, be re-sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 2 years and 11 months comprising a non-parole period of 1 year and 6 months to commence on 22 June 2012 and to expire on 21 December 2013 with a balance of term of 1 year and 5 months to expire on 21 May 2015.
(4) Order that the time served by the offender pursuant to that sentence imposed in the District Court is to count as part of the sentence imposed by the Court.
(5) An order that the respondent be released on parole on 21 December 2013.
(6) The respondent, in respect of the offence contrary to s 42(2) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999 be sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 6 months to commence on 22 June 2012 and to expire on 21 December 2012.
177CAMPBELL J:  This Crown appeal has two parts. The first is an appeal under s.5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (""Appeal Act"") against the sentence passed on the respondent in the District Court of New South Wales by his Honour Judge Jeffreys on 13th June 2012 for an offence contrary to the provisions of s.86(2)(b) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (""Crimes Act""). The second is an appeal brought under s.5DB Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) against the sentence passed on the same day in respect of ""a related summary offence"" specified in a certificate under s.166 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (""Procedure Act"").
178The indictment relevant to the s.5D Appeal Act appeal averred:
On 5 July 2009 at Northmead and elsewhere in the State of New South Wales, [the respondent] took [the victim] without her consent, with intent to obtain an advantage, namely to intimidate her and to have physical control over her and at the time of and immediately before the taking, actual bodily harm was occasioned to her.
179The respondent pleaded guilty to the charge on the indictment on the first day of trial, 12th October 2010. On sentence for the principal offence he requested the Court to take four additional offences into account on a Form 1. Those four additional offences, which I will detail later, arose out of the same episode of criminality as gave rise to the principal offence. I should not be taken as suggesting that this consideration is decisive of any question arising in this appeal. 
180The related summary offence was one of driving in a manner dangerous.  This offence was committed contemporaneously with the principal offence.  An additional related summary offence of common assault, a backup offence, was withdrawn after sentence on the principal offence.
181For the principal offence (taking into account the Form 1 offences), the primary judge sentenced the respondent to imprisonment for a period of two years to be served by way of intensive correction order under s.7 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""Sentencing Act""), commencing on 22nd June 2012, the day on which the sentence was passed. The intensive correction order was subject to conditions imposed under the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 (NSW) ('Administration Act"") and the regulation made thereunder.
182In respect of the serious driving offence, the primary judge, exercising his powers in that regard under s.10A Sentencing Act, convicted the respondent and disposed of the proceedings without imposing any additional penalty, except for disqualifying the respondent from holding a driver's license for a period of 12 months commencing on 13th June 2012, the day on which the sentences were passed.
The grounds of appeal
183The Crown advanced seven grounds of appeal as follows:
GROUND 1: His Honour failed to impose a sentence that reflected the objective seriousness of the offence.
GROUND 2: His Honour erred in ordering that the sentence be served by way of an intensive correction order.
GROUND 3: His Honour failed to impose a sentence that properly reflected the taking into account of the four matters on the Form 1 document.
GROUND 4: The weight his Honour afforded the respondent's subjective case impermissibly ameliorated the appropriate sentence.
GROUND 5: His Honour erred in the manner in which he took into account the mental illness of the applicant.
GROUND 6: His Honour erred in disposing of the offence of drive in a manner dangerous by convicting the respondent without imposing any other penalty pursuant to s10A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999.
GROUND 7: His Honour erred in imposing sentences that are manifestly inadequate.
184In written submissions and orally, the Crown grouped grounds 1 - 3 and, then 4 - 5, together. Ground 6 was addressed separately. Ground 7 received little by way of separate attention, but with respect, it may be that, properly understood, Grounds 1 to 5 were really particulars of Ground 7, and the real complaint of the Crown is one of manifest inadequacy: Dinsdale v. The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at 325 per Gleeson CJ and Hayne J. 
185The thrust of the Crown's argument was that a consideration of all facts, matters and circumstances appropriate to be considered in sentencing for the principal offence including: the objective seriousness of the offending; the need to take into account the additional offences; the need to fix an appropriate sentence for each of the principal offence and the s.166 matter; and the weight properly due the respondent's subjective case, required nothing less than a full time custodial sentence. An important corollary of the Crown's main argument is that, in all relevant circumstances, an intensive correction order served in the community is too lenient because it did not reflect the necessary ""reasonable proportionality between a sentence and the circumstances of the crime"":  R. v. Geddes (1936) 36 SR (NSW) 554 at 556; R. v. Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim. R 349 at 354.
Crown appeals
186In my judgment proper resolution of the appeals involves calling to mind two important considerations. First the rule of restraint required to be exercised as a matter of principle in the disposition of Crown appeals. And, secondly, a proper understanding of the nature of intensive correction orders. Both these matters are settled in principle and nothing in what I write is likely to extend the reader's understanding of them. But, sometimes, the exposition of one's understanding even of matters of settled principle assists in exposing the process of reasoning which leads to the conclusion expressed.
187In Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at 500 [112] Bell J spoke of:
..[t]he distinctive nature of Crown appeals, which is that they should be brought as a rarity to establish a matter of principle including, where appropriate, to address manifest inadequacy in sentencing standards. (Emphasis added; citations omitted.)
Her Honour's dissent does not affect the accuracy of this statement. In their majority joint judgment, French CJ, Crennan, and Kiefel JJ said at 466 [2]:
In Crown appeals, circumstances may combine to produce the result that if the appeal is allowed the guidance provided to sentencing judges will be limited and the decision may occasion injustice.
And at 477 [36] their Honours explained that the focus upon general guidance of sentencing courts ""is a limiting purpose. It does not extend to the general correction of errors made by sentencing judges. It provides a framework within which to assess the significance of factors relevant to the exercise of the discretion"". These principles particularly affect the existence and exercise of the ""residual discretion"" which is ""a discretion to decline to interfere even though the sentence is erroneously lenient"": at 466 [1]. This discretion has not been extinguished by the enactment of s68A Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) excluding the element of double jeopardy as a limiting consideration in the determination of a Crown appeal: at 471-2 [26]. It will be necessary to return to these considerations later in these reasons. 
188To ascertain their true nature, and to enable due consideration of the argument in the light of the particular circumstances of the case, it may be useful to summarise the law relating to intensive correction orders now.
Intensive correction orders
189Intensive correction orders (sometimes referred to in these reasons as ICOs) are a relatively new sentencing option first introduced in New South Wales on the enactment of the Crimes (Sentencing Legislation) Amendment (Intensive Correction Orders) Act 2010 (NSW) which commenced on 1st October 2010.  
190The statutory provisions relevant to the making of intensive correction orders are ss.5, 7, 64 - 73A Sentencing Act; Part 3 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Regulation 2010 (""Sentencing Regulation""); Part 3 (ss.80 - 93) Administration Act and Chapter 3 (Clauses 174 - 178) Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Regulation 2008 (NSW) (""Administration Regulation""). Similar sentencing options are available elsewhere in Australia and New Zealand:  R. v. Tannous [2012] NSWCCA 243 at [19] - [21] per Basten JA (Hall and Beech-Jones JJ agreeing). 
191Before Tannous, the legislation had been considered by this Court a number of times, which decisions are analysed and discussed by a five - judge bench in R. v. Pogson; R. v. Lapham; R. v. Martin [2012] NSWCCA 225; 91 ACSR 420 at [79] - [93] per McClellan CJ at CL (as he then was) and Johnson J; Price (substantially), R.A. Hulme and Button JJ agreeing. As the relevant statutory provisions are set out in the joint judgment in Pogson from [38] - [67], it is unnecessary for me to reproduce them here. The expanded court was constituted in Pogson to resolve uncertainties arising from previous decisions concerning the circumstances in which an intensive correction order is available as a sentencing option. The Court as presently constituted is bound by that decision. Therefore, it is unnecessary for me to undertake the same review and analysis again. Rather, I gratefully draw upon the conclusions expressed in Pogson for the purpose of this case.
192It is not necessary for me to set out the legislative history, or draw upon the materials that may be admissible under s.34 Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW). This material has already been referred to in the joint judgment in Pogson and informs the conclusions expressed there: see also Tannous [11] - [25].
193If one first considers, as one must, the statutory scheme, it is in my view fundamental to bear in mind that an intensive correction order is intended by the Legislature, in an appropriate case, to operate as a means of serving a term of imprisonment: s.7 (1) Procedure Act. This means that a court considering an intensive correction order must first have been satisfied ""having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate"": s. 5 (1) Sentencing Act. Sight should not be lost of the consideration, implicit in the section, that imprisonment is the most severe penalty available to a sentencing court.  As it is put in the joint judgment in Pogson (drawing upon Wehlan v. R. [2012] NSWCCA 147 at [120] per Schmidt J, Allsop P (as he then was) and Davies J agreeing):
It should be kept in mind that an ICO is a substantial punishment to be utilised in an appropriate case: Wehlan at [120].  However, as with all sentencing options which do not involve immediate incarceration, it may also reflect a significant degree of leniency:  Wehlan at [120].  
Their Honours also pointed out ""the severity of an ICO has been underscored in several Victorian decisions"". At [111] McClellan CJ at CL and Johnson J observed:
However, ... the stringent conditions attached to an ICO ensure that an offender subject to such an order is not living a carefree existence amongst the community. An ICO deprives an offender of his or her liberty in a real and not merely fictional sense.
194At [72] their Honours described the mandatory conditions imposed by dint of s.81 Administration Act, and contained in Clause 175 Administration Regulation, as ""prescriptive and intrusive"".
195The sanction for any breach of an intensive correction order is in the hands of the executive branch of government under the Administration Act. The options available to the Commissioner of Corrective Services, and the Parole Authority, respectively, escalate in severity. In appropriate circumstances, the Parole Authority is authorised by s.163 Administration Act, after complying with statutory conditions, to make an order revoking the intensive correction order. The effect of the revocation order is that the offender is taken into custody: s.164 Administration Act.  Under s.165 Administration Act, the Parole Authority ""may make an order re-instating the offender's intensive correction order in respect of the remaining balance of the offender's sentence"" but only after the offender has served at least one month of the sentence by way of full time detention.
196As it was put in the joint judgment at [100]:
It is apparent that the mandatory conditions may operate to impose significant restrictions on an offender's freedom. And, of course, a breach of the conditions may result in his or her sentencing regime being altered, including being required to serve the balance of the sentence in full-time custody.
197It is an important aspect of the ratio of Pogson that the only categories of offence ""or offenders"" excluded from the potential availability of an intensive correction order are prescribed sexual offences (and offenders), the subject of s.66 Sentencing Act. 
198The availability of an intensive correction order is not restricted to offenders who have a particular need to be rehabilitated, that is to say those who need to be corrected from criminal engagement and thereby prevented from re-offending by the supervised observance of the mandatory conditions to which they will be subject.  For in the sense discussed by King CJ in Vartzokas v Zanker (1989) 51 SASR 277 at 279, ""every offender is in need of rehabilitation"":  Pogson at [17] - [125].
Statutory procedures
199In Tannous, at [12] - [14], Basten JA described the specific procedures to be followed for the making of an intensive correction order in the following terms:
[12] Part 5, by contrast, is specific to procedures for intensive correction orders: s 64-73A. An intensive correction order is not available in respect of certain sexual offences: s 66. Further, it may not be made unless the court is satisfied with respect to the conditions of eligibility in s 67. These include satisfaction that the offender is ""a suitable person"" to serve the sentence by way of intensive correction in the community: s 67(1)(b).
[13] Section 69 states that before imposing a sentence of imprisonment ""the court may refer the offender for assessment as to the suitability of the offender for intensive correction in the community"": s 69(1). Whilst that provision confers a power, it appears that the obtaining of such a report is a necessary pre-condition to making such an order because there is a requirement for the court, in taking that step, to have regard to the contents of the assessment report on the offender: s 67(2)(a). Further, the power to make such an order is conditioned upon an affirmative assessment that the offender is a suitable person to serve the sentence in the community: s 67(4). A finding of suitability does not, however, mandate such an order: s 67(3).
[14] The exercise of the power to make an intensive correction order is not solely contained within the Sentencing Procedure Act. There is a further requirement that the sentencing court impose conditions, prescribed as mandatory conditions by the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Regulation 2008 (NSW), the obligation being imposed by s 81(2) of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 (""the Administration Act"").
200The steps necessary to be followed in compliance with all of the provisions of the Sentencing Act before a sentencing judge may make an intensive correction order are as follows:
(1)Satisfaction of the requirements of s.5(1): ""no other penalty than imprisonment is appropriate"";
(2)Imprisonment for how long?  As a matter of principle ""the term of the sentence cannot be influenced by what order might be made after the sentence has been imposed"":  R. v. Douar [2005] NSWCCA 455; 159 A Crim R 154 at [72]. But at this stage, the question of the appropriateness of an intensive correction order must have been raised, or suggested itself, because of s.69. As Basten JA has pointed out, referral of the offender for assessment as to his or her suitability for an intensive correction order is mandatory before any final decision is made. Moreover, s.69 (2) Sentencing Act provides:
A court is not to refer an offender for such an assessment unless satisfied, having considered all the alternatives, that no sentence other than imprisonment is appropriate and that the sentence is likely to be for a period of no more than 2 years.
It is impermissible for a court to either shorten or extend the period proposed to justify the making of the order:  R. v. Stephen [2003] NSWCCA 377 at [23] R. v. Ngo [2005] NSWCCA 107 at [33] (both decisions were concerned with periodic detention). Also, because s.7 (2) of the Sentencing Act prohibits the setting of a non-parole period, the usual order of things is varied. Section 44(1) requires a Court to ""first ... set a non-parole period for the sentence"". Normally, because the non-parole period is the minimum time that an offender must serve, its length is the ""primary perspective"" of the sentencing process: Power v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 623 at 627 - 629; R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 at 716[55] - 717 [57]. Accordingly the sentencing court must have formed a provisional view ""that the sentence is likely to be for a period of no more than 2 years"". This is a reference to the total term, not a non-parole period, even if fixed terms are usually equated with non-parole periods;
(3) The court then must refer the offender for assessment as to the suitability of the offender for intensive correction in the community.  The assessment is carried out on behalf of the Commissioner of Corrective Services: s.70 Sentencing Act; Clause 14 Sentencing Regulation.  Obviously, this will involve an adjournment of the proceedings on sentence.  
(4) When the sentencing proceedings resume, the court, ""for any sufficient reason"", may decline to make an intensive correction order ""despite the contents of the assessment report"" s.67(3). But it may only make an intensive correction order if it is satisfied of the matters contained in paragraphs (a) - (d) inclusive of s.67(1). Of these, the Court may only be satisfied that the offender is a suitable person ""if the assessment report states, that in the opinion of the person making the assessment, the offender is a suitable person to serve the sentence by way of intensive correction in the community"": s.67(4). And an order may be made only if the Court is satisfied ""that it is appropriate in all of the circumstances"": s.67(1)(c). Naturally, such satisfaction will depend upon the consideration of all the facts, matters and circumstances appropriate to the sentencing task generally including the principles that underpin sentencing law. Section 68 imposes limits on the imposition of an intensive correction order concurrently, or consecutively, with other terms of imprisonment;
(5) By dint of s.81(2) of the Administration Act, the Court must make an order imposing the conditions specified in Clause 175 of the Regulation made under that Act. Other conditions may be imposed as a matter of discretion.
201From step (3) onwards it is clear that the focus of the process is on the suitability of the offender to serve his sentence by way of intensive correction. This will require a particular emphasis on the ""subjective features"" of the case. Of course, a decision that the circumstances of the offence and the offender are inconsistent with the degree of leniency implicit in an intensive correction order will be ""sufficient reason"" for declining to make the order notwithstanding an assessment favouring the offender. 
202In my judgment it is relevant to bear in mind these statutory requirements, and the way they impact upon sentencing practice, when considering, and assessing, the sentencing judge's reasons for sentence.  
Proceedings in the District Court
203The offence was committed on 5th July 2009 and the respondent was arrested on the same day, but released on conditional bail. Additional conditions were imposed when he came before the Local Court on 10th July 2009.  
204When arraigned in the District Court on 12th October 2010, the respondent pleaded guilty. A pre-sentence report was ordered and for that purpose the bail conditions were amended requiring the respondent to attend the Burwood Office of the Probation and Parole Service by a specified time and thereafter as directed. The proceedings were adjourned to 17th December 2010. The respondent kept his appointment, but the pre-sentence report initially produced was very short because the author became ill. When the matter was again before the District Court on 17th December, a further pre-sentence report was ordered and the matter was again adjourned, this time to 29th April 2011. The second report was provided on 28th April 2011, but the matter was ""not reached"" on 29th and stood-over to 16th June 2011 when it came before the sentencing judge. Substantial evidence was taken on that day including the testimony of the respondent.
205The evidence tendered on behalf of the respondent included a report of Dr. Elsa Bernardi, psychiatrist, of 15th June 2011 (Exhibit 2).  She recorded a history of the consumption of the sleeping medication Stilnox, in combination with the consumption of alcohol earlier in the evening, before the commission of the offence. Dr. Bernardi expressed the view that ""this combination led to pathological intoxication and contributed to the assault"".  
206During the course of argument, the sentencing judge quizzed counsel about this phenomenon. His Honour said he would be ""very interested"" to receive further evidence about this matter, which prompted an application for an adjournment on behalf of the respondent, consented to by the Crown (16/06/11 extract of transcript 5.15-45; 32.5-20T). The matter was adjourned until Friday 12th August 2011.
207Following the adjournment, a pharmacological report was requested with all due promptitude by the Legal Aid Commission from Associate Professor Starmer. But it was not prepared until 19th August 2011, and not received until 25th August. This necessitated further adjournment from the 12th August 2011.
208The matter was mentioned before the sentencing judge on 19th August 2011 at which time counsel were unaware that the report would be signed that day. The matter was adjourned again to 28th October 2011.  Unfortunately the matter had to be adjourned again because counsel who had previously appeared was unavailable. The matter was stood-over to 15th December 2011 with a direction that counsel provide written submissions in relation to the evidence which had by then been received about the effects of Stilnox.  
209On 15th December 2011, Prof. Starmer's report was tendered without objection. Evidence about the respondent's continuing employment was also tendered; further argument ensued leaving insufficient time that day for his Honour to deal with the matter finally. His Honour's intention had been to deal with the matter after a jury had been allowed home early for the weekend, or at least so I infer. Sentencing was adjourned to 2nd March 2012 at 2 p.m.
210The matter was not dealt with on the 2nd March for reasons that are not obvious from the material before this Court. It was mentioned on the 9th March and stood over to 5th April 2012 for sentence. On that day having confirmed ""that all submissions are completed"", his Honour said:
Well I've been giving anxious consideration to this matter and it seems to me that it's likely that a custodial sentence that would be imposed would be in the region of two years. Consequently I propose ordering an assessment in relation to an intensive correction order, unless either of you have got something to say about that. (05.04.12: 1.30T).
His Honour made it clear that referral for assessment was not an indication that he had finally decided to make such an order. His Honour made an order under s.69 Sentencing Act, and adjourned the proceedings to 8th June 2012.
211After hearing further argument on 8th June, his Honour adjourned the matter to Wednesday, 13th June 2012 for sentence and indicated ""I will be imposing a sentence of two years imprisonment by way of an intensive correctional order"". It is relevant to note that by then the respondent had been on conditional bail just 3 weeks short of 3 years.
Objective circumstances of the indictable offence
212Section 86 of the Crimes Act, so far as is relevant, is in the following terms:
86   Kidnapping
(1) Basic offenceA person who takes or detains a person, without the person's consent: (a) with the intention of holding the person to ransom, or(a1)  with the intention of committing a serious indictable offence, or(b) with the intention of obtaining any other advantage,
is liable to imprisonment for 14 years.
(2) Aggravated offenceA person is guilty of an offence under this subsection if: (a)  the person commits an offence under subsection (1) in the company of another person or persons, or(b) the person commits an offence under subsection (1) and at the time of, or immediately before or after, the commission of the offence, actual bodily harm is occasioned to the alleged victim.
A person convicted of an offence under this subsection is liable to imprisonment for 20 years.
In the present case, paragraph (b) of subsection 2 is the source of the relevant aggravation. In particular, the offence to which the respondent pleaded guilty included the element of occasioning actual bodily harm to the victim immediately before the commission of the basic offence.
213As I stated at the outset, the additional offences on the Form 1 arose out of the same events, as did the related summary charge on the s.166 certificate. The sentencing judge recorded his findings in respect of each matter compendiously at [5] - [13] of his reasons on sentence, which I set out as follows:
5. The facts are that the offender and Ms. Sprowle had been in a relationship prior to 5 July 2009.  On that day at about 1:30 am, Ms. Sprowle drove her motor vehicle to the Parramatta McDonald's restaurant in Parramatta.  She was with two friends, she had left her vehicle there, she came back and she tried to start her vehicle and she was unable to start it as the battery had gone flat.  During that day Ms. Sprowle had been receiving text messages from the offender. After not being able to raise help from anyone else, she responded to the text messages that she had been receiving by text asking the offender if he had any jumper leads. Prior to receiving any response from the offender, Ms. Sprowle decided to accept a lift home and that is where she went. When she was being driven home she received a text message from the offender saying that he could bring jumper leads down to where she was and she responded by saying that she was being driven to her home by a friend.  A little bit later she received a phone call that the offender would pick her up.
6. The offender then went to her home and when she was there she, Ms. Sprowle, saw a white utility pull up and she saw the offender in the passenger seat.  The offender called out to her ""hurry up, I've got the jumper leads, we'll go and fix the car"".  Ms. Sprowle got into the utility and it was driven to the McDonald's car park.  When the offender and Ms. Sprowle and the other person got to the car, Ms. Sprowle's car started and the offender said that he would drive Ms. Sprowle's car and the other person left. Ms. Sprowle did not want the offender to drive her car as she had formed the view that he had been drinking. She ended up driving her car with the offender in the passenger seat.
7. As she was driving along Windsor Road, the offender said to her, ""I bet you had a good night, where did you go?  Without warning Ms. Sprowle felt a blow to the side of her face, she pulled the car to the side of the road and said to the offender, ""Get out of the car"".  The offender put his hands up to his face and said, ""I'm really sorry."" She again told him to get out of the car and he refused.  At this stage the car was at the intersection of Windsor Road and Whitehaven Road, Northmead. The offender struck Ms. Sprowle to the face with his right arm and pushed her face against the driver's side glass window and started pulling her hair. He pushed her against the door and continued to push her against the window.  Ultimately Ms. Sprowle was occasioned bruising to her face and forehead with an indentation to the left side of the forehead as a result of the assault.
8. After some time Ms. Sprowle managed to open her door and she fell out of the car. As she lay on the ground she could see that the driver side door was still open.  She saw the offender climb across into the driver's seat, close the door and drive off a short distance.  She then saw her car being driven rapidly in reverse towards her.  She jumped over a small brick fence to avoid being struck by the vehicle. The vehicle mounted the kerb and crossed the nature strip and the rear of the vehicle struck Ms. Sprowle's arm. The vehicle came to a stop and the offender got out and came up to Ms. Sprowle, she was screaming for help. He began to hit her again.  He grabbed her by the hair and dragged her towards the car.  During the course of this assault and previously Ms. Sprowle was on the telephone ringing triple-0. Ms. Sprowle yelled, ""Help, help somebody help"" and said to the offender, ""Please stop, please just leave me alone"".
9. The offender began to drag Ms. Sprowle towards the vehicle for a short distance before leaving her on the ground. He got back into the vehicle and moved it onto the roadway on the corner of Whitehaven Road and Windsor Road, Northmead. He got out and again approached Ms. Sprowle. She got off the ground and went to the passenger side of the vehicle and attempted to lock herself in the vehicle.  The offender put his hand through the open passenger side window and opened the door. He grabbed her by the neck and hair and dragged her out of the vehicle. He kneed Ms. Sprowle in the stomach, winding her and causing her to fall to the ground. The offender then kicked Ms. Sprowle to her ribs and buttocks. Ms. Sprowle screamed, ""You're killing me"".  The offender said, ""Oh yeah"". He kicked at her again. Ms. Sprowle begged the offender not to touch her. He yelled at her, I'll fucking, I'll kill you, I'll fucking kill you, I swear I'll kill you. I don't give a fuck, you fuck it up, you think I fucking care about you, I don't fucking care, you don't fucking love me, you don't fucking love me."" The offender took hold of Ms. Sprowle's hair and dragged her over to the passenger side of the vehicle where the front passenger door was still open.  The offender forced her into the front passenger seat.
10. It is clear on my view of the evidence that the offence for which the offender pleaded guilty on indictment commences at this particular time, although the assault occasioning actual bodily harm was certainly before.  The offender picked Ms. Sprowle up and attempted to force her body into the foot space of the passenger side of the vehicle.  She was stuck in the corner of the foot space with her leg still hanging out of the vehicle.  The offender pulled around to the driver's side of the vehicle and got into the driver's seat.  He started driving the vehicle and Ms. Sprowle pulled herself inside the vehicle and closed the door.  Ms. Sprowle had occasioned bruising to her side, back and buttocks and minor lacerations to her feet as a consequence of the assault.  The offender drove in a northerly direction upon Windsor Road at high speed. Ms. Sprowle  said, ""Please stop the car"".  The offender said, ""No, I'm going to crash it.""  Ms. Sprowle  said, ""Slow down, you're going to kill us"".  The offender said, ""Good, I will kill you"".  Ms. Sprowle said, ""Please slow down, please stop the car you're going to kill us both.""  The offender said, ""Good, I have nothing to lose.""  The offender continued to repeat the words, ""I'm going to kill you, I'm going to crash the car, I don't care about you or anything.""
11. As the car was about a hundred metres south of the intersection of the M2 Motorway, the vehicle nearly collided with a Holden sedan travelling lane two.  The offender continued driving at high speed until he reached the intersection of Cook Street where he turned right at high speed.  The rear of the vehicle lost control and slid towards a telegraph pole on the western kerb of Cook Street narrowly missing it.  The offender continued driving at high speed until he reached the intersection of James Street, Baulkham Hills.  The offender at that time lived in James Street.  He attempted to turn left but was travelling too fast and collided with a keep left sign on the median strip in the middle of James Street.  The offender continued driving to the top of James Street, Baulkham Hills where he pulled to the right side of the roadway, stopped the vehicle outside a unit complex near the intersection of Railway Street Baulkham Hills.  Ms. Sprowle heard sirens and got out of the vehicle.
12. The offender drove the vehicle into the underground car park of the unit complex where he stayed for a short time. The offender walked up the driveway towards Ms. Sprowle from the underground car park.  He approached Ms. Sprowle and started pushing her.  The offender said, ""Come inside, let's talk"".  At this time Ms. Sprowle noticed that the offender had her mobile phone in his hand.  She attempted to get her phone from the offender but was unable to.  The offender walked back into the unit complex.  A male person asked the offender to return Ms. Sprowle's phone.  The male returned with the phone and handed it to Ms. Sprowle.  The offender came up to Ms. Sprowle and saw that she was on the phone and he started screaming at her and tried to take the phone off her.  The offender managed to take the phone from her and threw it against a nearby brick wall causing it to break into pieces.  The offender was shortly after that arrested.
13. So far as the offence on the indictment, which is shortly known as kidnapping, it is quite clear that the offending started at the intersection of Whitehaven Road and Windsor Road and the offending was whilst Ms. Sprowle was taken into the motor car, the motor car was then driven very quickly up the street, as I have just said.  It is quite clear in my view that the length of time that Ms. Sprowle was detained was a matter of some minutes rather than longer. It is quite clear from the material before me, that it was in the course of travel from the intersection to where the vehicle stopped that the detention took place.  That, as I understand it, is something in the region of about two kilometres.
214I observe that no medical or psychiatric evidence was tendered quantifying the nature and extent of the actual bodily harm suffered by the victim. But in her Victim Impact Statement, the victim spoke of her physical injuries, including scars which were then ""still visible"", and of the emotional consequences, which must be real enough. 
215As the infliction of actual bodily harm is an ingredient of the offence, I interpolate that it is important that care be brought to bear so as not to double count this consideration contrary to s. 21A (2) Sentencing Act.  But, I will proceed on the basis that the injury and emotional harm caused by the offence to the victim were not insubstantial.
216The additional offences on the Form 1 are: first, the initial assaults occasioning actual bodily harm the subject of [7] of his Honour's reasons; secondly, reversing the car at her in [8], averred as using ""an offensive implement... with intent to commit an indictable offence""; thirdly, intentional damaging her the mobile phone by throwing it against the wall; and fourthly, taking and driving the victim's car without her permission.
217The manner of the applicant's driving during the period the victim was detained may well have been without regard for public safety, but as this is the related summary offence, again care must be taken to avoid double punishment. This factor cannot both increase the objective seriousness of the principal offending, and at the same time attract significant independent punishment. 
218Given the previous domestic relationship, it may be said that the respondent abused his position of trust in relation to the victim. However, the relationship had previously degenerated and the victim had formed a new relationship with another person.  Accordingly, the principles discussed in R v Hamid [2006] NSWCCA 302; 164 A Crim R 179 at 195 [86] may not be strictly apposite, even though the present offence is one that meets the definition of ""serious personal violence offence"" in s.21A(6) Sentencing Act. Trust between them must have dissolved already.
219The offence was certainly not planned, but rather occurred in a spontaneous and opportunistic way.  
220An element of the offence is the intent to obtain an advantage. Here, the Crown relied upon psychological gratification as advantage. 
221The only criminal offence on the respondents record at the time of the commission of the subject offence was a conviction for affray, for which he was dealt with by the Downing Centre Local Court on 25th November 2006 with a $500 fine.  This particular offence did not trouble the sentencing judge greatly. Of more concern were convictions recorded subsequently to the 5th July 2009. These offences were related to the disintegration of his relationship with the victim, and to the formation of her new relationship (a matter to which I will return below). 
222A few days before 5th July 2009, the victim had introduced the respondent to her new partner. As is not unknown in the annals of human affairs, an altercation developed between the two young men. No complaint was made about the respondent's conduct on this occasion until after the events of 5th July 2009, when the respondent was charged with common assault. The matter was dealt with by the imposition of a fine on the 8th February 2010.
223It is necessary to record that other offences relating to the victim, to which the respondent pleaded guilty, occurred on 10th July 2009 and were dealt with in the Parramatta Local Court on the 18thFebruary 2010 by the imposition of a community service order of 100 hours duration. These were offences of contravention of an apprehended domestic violence order by approaching the residence of the victim, and breaking into the residence with the intention of committing an indictable offence. 
224At the time he was charged with the instant offence, an apprehended violence order was made in favour of the victim, including the usual condition restraining the respondent from approaching her home.
225The circumstances of the subsequent offences were that a very short time before 5th July 2009, perhaps surprisingly, given the altercation which occurred when the two young men met, the victim showed the respondent the home she shared with her new partner. He noticed some garden lamps that he and the victim had purchased during their cohabitation. He formed the intention to reclaim possession of them. Accordingly, on 10th July 2009, the respondent drove to the victim's home, broke in and took the lamps. He was soon apprehended and charged.  
226At the time he was charged with the instant offence, he was also charged with an offence of refusing to submit to a breath analysis in accordance with the directions of a police officer contrary to s15(4) Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999 (NSW). In the exercise of the power under s.205 Road Transport (General) Act 2005 (NSW), the police officer gave the applicant a notice suspending his driver's licence. Driving to the victim's home contravened the police suspension. The Parramatta Local Court dealt with this offence at the same time as the other two. For the driving offence he was fined $1,000 and disqualified for 12 months commencing on 22nd July 2009. There is no doubt that the police suspension was validly issued under the relevant legislation. Such a suspension inures until a court determines the charge in respect of which it is given, or the charge is withdrawn. In the present case, the charge was withdrawn on the 6thJune 2010, I infer from the information provided to the Court by the Crown Particulars of Trial. 
227The respondent's traffic record is very poor. He had incurred a number of traffic infringement notices for speeding matters. He had also been subject to a number of suspensions of his licence by administrative action because of his record, and due to default in paying some fines. Prior to the 18th February 2010, it had never been necessary for a court to deal with him for a traffic matter. 
228The respondent was also dealt with at North Sydney Local Court on 31st May 2011 on a charge of driving when his licence was cancelled on 28th December 2010. The circumstances of this were that when the disqualification imposed at Parramatta Local Court on 10th February 2010 expired on 22nd July 2010 (it had been backdated), the respondent neglected to reapply for his licence, being ignorant of the necessity so to do. Ignorance of the law is, of course, no excuse, as all are bound by it. The respondent apparently remedied this omission and when he was dealt with on the 31st May 2011, he received the benefit of a twelve-month good behaviour bond under s.10 Sentencing Act. These complexities in relation to the applicant's criminal and driving record were referred to and taken into account by the sentencing judge.
The respondent's subjective case
229The respondent was born on 30th December 1982. Accordingly, he was aged 26 years and 8 months at the date of the offence, and 29 years and 7 months when he was sentenced.  
230The respondent grew up in Sydney and enjoyed a happy and uneventful childhood and adolescence. His father is a company director, and his mother a registered nurse, now retired. His home background was stable until his parents separated when he was 23 years old.
231He was educated at a private school, where he had friends and a good relationship with his teachers. Although said to be an above average scholar, he did not attend university.
232From the time he left school he has worked in the financial industry in an administrative capacity.
233He has had a creditable employment history since leaving school, except for a period of some months around the time of the occurrence of the subject offence, when he was unemployed.
234There were a number of relevant psychological and emotional issues dealt with by Dr. Westmore in his psychiatric report of 11th April 2011 (Exhibit 1).  The trial judge accepted Dr. Westmore's views.  
235Dr. Westmore diagnosed the respondent as suffering from a number of mental disorders including a post traumatic stress disorder, an alcohol abuse disorder and a depressive illness. The respondent does not suffer a significant personality disorder, and in particular does not have an antisocial personality disorder (the serious nature of the offences notwithstanding).
236The origin of the post-traumatic stress disorder is an armed hold-up in August 2001, when the respondent was working in a part-time job whilst still at school. At the time, he had ""limited treatment"" extending only to some counselling. The post-traumatic stress disorder was reignited when he and his victim suffered injury in a motor vehicle accident in May 2006.  
237The victim miscarried their child in September 2006 and in December 2006 the respondent was very distressed by his parents' separation.
238Stilnox was prescribed as treatment following the motor vehicle accident and the respondent continued its use up until the time of the offending. 
239The respondent and the victim met in 2001 and fell in love. They formed a close relationship, and commenced living together initially in the victim's parents' house. The relationship suffered significant stress relating to the death of the victim's father, the motor vehicle accident and the tragic miscarriage. Following the miscarriage their relationship started to fall apart, and they separated in 2007 for more than a year. It seems that during the period of separation the victim met her new partner, which development was apparently unknown to the respondent until just before the offending.
240They met again by chance. At that time the respondent was employed in a bank. He had received the proceeds of his motor accident compensation claim and had purchased his own home, subject to a mortgage. He and the victim rekindled their relationship and after a period he resigned his employment so he could spend more time with her.  Although they were living in his house, at times the victim would absent herself telling the applicant, perhaps falsely, that she was going to stay with her mother.
241It later came to light that during her absences the victim was seeing her new partner.  In fact, she and her new partner purchased a house together. A love-triangle seems to have developed where both young men were vying for the affection of the victim.  After the respondent found out, the victim had promised to end the relationship with her new partner. And she may have done so for a period.
242Sometime before 5th July 2009, the victim made up her mind in favour of the new partner and recommenced cohabiting with him. This is borne out by the altercation between the respondent and the new partner, and the victim - for reasons unexplained by the evidence - showing the respondent their new home.
243The respondent was unemployed, depressed, requiring Stilnox to sleep and abusing alcohol. Although the respondent gave evidence that he and the victim were residing together, this seems clearly to be incorrect. For his evidence was that he had learnt about the new relationship two weeks before the offence. He gave evidence about meeting his rival and being shown their new home. He gave evidence of his emotional hurt and of the altercation between him and his rival. The circumstance that the victim ignored his earlier text messages is evidence that they were not then cohabiting.
244The respondent's father gave supportive evidence about the acrimonious nature of his separation from the respondent's mother, and the lack of support he had been giving his son during the time leading up to the commission of the offences. In particular he had been unaware of his son's emotional issues, and he had been critical of his son's inability to cope financially during the period of unemployment.
245On the night of the offending, the respondent had ingested the prescription drug Stilnox as part of his treatment for his post-traumatic stress disorder, to get to sleep. After taking the drug, he was called by some friends to socialise, which, unwisely to say the least, he did. In the course of this socialising he imbibed a significant amount of alcohol in the form of vodka drinks. During this period he became aware of the victim's text message seeking assistance.
246A considerable amount of evidence was led about the affect of Stilnox in combination with alcohol. Prof. Starmer, the pharmacologist, said a number of relevant things. First, Stilnox should not be prescribed for a period in excess of 4 weeks, as long term use may give rise to significant side effects including agitation, irritability, aggressiveness, rages and inappropriate behaviour. He confirmed the amnesic affect of the combination, and stated that a warning to this effect had only recently been included in the patient information provided with the drug. He also expressed the view that:
It is likely that a combination of alcohol abuse and Stilnox ... led to pathological intoxication and contributed to the assault, which occurred against the background of a dysfunctional relationship.
247I interpolate that, this evidence notwithstanding, the sentencing judge did not treat the ingestion of this combination as a mitigating factor. Rather, he treated it as providing an explanation for conduct that was out of character: reasons p17 [32]. This approach is unexceptionable being consistent with the approach taken to intoxication by illicit drugs: see for example R. v. Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 at 382 [178]; 396 [275]; 409 [331]; 413 [348] - [349].
248The respondent took full advantage of the opportunity provided to him by the delay in the legal process, which delay was not due to the conduct of the prosecution, to demonstrate reform, rehabilitation and correction. He again sought medical treatment for his mental health problems, eliminated Stilnox from his treatment, and reduced his alcohol consumption from abuse to occasional social drinking only.
249He formed a new relationship which is loving and supportive. Importantly, soon after the incident he recommenced fulltime employment. A reference from his initial supervisor spoke highly of him, praising his attitude, productivity and achievement.  She described him as ""a very positive, reliable and hard worker"". A subsequent supervisor described him as ""a very valuable team player"". She praised his reliability, punctuality, trustworthiness and diligence. His employer's quality assurance manager described him as ""conscientious, dependable, reliable and honest"".  She spoke highly of his ""interpersonal skills"".
250In a letter, his father expressed his view that the offence was completely out of character. He confirmed the changes in the respondent since the offending. A person who worked in the same industry, who knew of the offending, also expressed the view that the respondent's behaviour was completely out of character. He said that he had never seen the respondent act in a way that was unlawful or could ever be considered a danger to anyone. He said that the respondent had expressed his remorsefulness on numerous occasions.  
251The respondent gave evidence in writing and orally about his contrition and remorse. The sentencing judge set out this evidence in his reasons. He found that the respondent had ""shown deep contrition and remorse"".  (Reasons p14 [31]).
252The sentencing judge had before him three reports prepared by the Probation and Parole Service dated 17th December 2010, 29th April 2011 and 8th June 2012. The first two were pre-sentence reports and the third the intensive correction order assessment. These reports: confirmed that the respondent completed his community service order satisfactorily and without incident; confirmed his full time employment; gave a consistent history of the radical reduction in his consumption of alcohol; and confirmed the apparent genuineness of his contrition and remorsefulness.  
253The author of the report dated 29th April 2011 concluded:
[The respondent] appears to be a young man who achieved well as an adolescent but whose life came undone with a period of immaturity, poor decision-making and irresponsibility combined with some adverse circumstances.  He has used the remand period to regain purpose and direction by finding and advancing his employment, seeking the guidance of counselling and reconnection with the support of his parents and friends. He is reportedly improving his financial position also.
254The author of the intensive correction order assessment report confirmed the respondent's ongoing full time employment, his satisfactory completion of the earlier community service order, and his acknowledgment of responsibility by acknowledging the link between his offending behaviour and his alcohol abuse.  
255The author assessed the respondent as being at a low risk of re-offending.  The crinogenic needs related to alcohol consumption and emotional issues, which the respondent, in the author's opinion, seemed to be addressing.  The author stated:
[The respondent] appeared to demonstrate his ability to abstain from alcohol and illicit substances as all results from random breath tests and urine analysis conducted during the assessment period reported negative results.  Additionally, [the respondent] expressed his willingness to engage in treatment to address his alcohol issues if deemed necessary.
The author was satisfied that the respondent was in a positive relationship and had demonstrated an ability to maintain such relationships. After conducting a full review, the author was satisfied that ""there appears to be no factor that would impact negatively on the offender's ability to comply with the requirements of an intensive correction order"". The respondent was assessed as suitable and signed the required undertaking.  
Reasons for sentence
256From the outset, his Honour acknowledged that non-custodial sentences would generally not be appropriate for an offence under s.86 Crimes Act, especially for an offence in this aggravated form, correctly relying upon R. v. Anforth [2003] NSWCCA 222 as authority for this proposition. His Honour acknowledged that the domestic context did not lessen the gravity of the offence: Heine v R [2008] NSWCCA 61 at [40].
257The sentencing judge acknowledged by reference to R. v. Chaplin [2006] NSWCCA 40; 160 A Crim R 85 at [31] that the punishment must be sufficient to both punish and deter the respondent from repeating the offence.  
258In terms of assessing the objective seriousness of the offence, the sentencing judge directed himself by reference to the judgment of Roden J in R v Collett (Unreported, 07/06/1979 NSWCCA; applied in Wiliams v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 33 and R v Newell [2004] NSWCCA 183). By reference to these authorities, his Honour set out what he regarded as seven relevant criteria arising relevant to assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending. (I will not repeat them). But clearly he had the importance of this consideration at the forefront of his mind. In this regard his Honour emphasised that the period of detention was short and the place of detention was the victim's motor vehicle, which was being driven in a general direction towards the respondent's home, previously shared with the victim.
259His Honour then turned to the subjective case and set out the details I have referred to already. In so far as the respondent's record was concerned, leaving aside the traffic record, his Honour considered that his criminal history did not other than ""marginally disentitle"" the respondent to leniency. As I have said, he regarded the combination of Stilnox and alcohol not as mitigating the offence, but only as helping to explain it.
260His Honour referred to the statement of principle of McClellan CJ at CL in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v. De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 at 43 [177] summarising the principles to be applied when sentencing a person suffering from a mental illness.  For the same purpose his Honour referred to Muldrock v. The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at 137 [50] - 193 [55]. Although he found that the offender ""has had substantial psychological and psychiatric difficulties"", which in my view was open, as I read his reasons, he did not over-emphasise their significance as factors capable of pointing in the direction of leniency.
261At the very outset of his reasons, his Honour had referred to the additional offences on the Form 1, and directed himself correctly in relation to the significance of these matters by reference to Attorney General's Application [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146 at 159 [42] per Spigelman CJ. His Honour said that the additional offences may require an appropriate increase in the sentence otherwise applicable to either a significant, or marginal, extent: (Reasons [3]).
262The sentencing judge also took into account the guilty plea entered on the first day of the trial following, ""it seems"", negotiation. His Honour allowed a discount on the sentence otherwise to be imposed of 15 per cent:  (reasons p2 [4]). The learned Crown Prosecutor, who appeared on sentencing, but not on appeal, conceded the appropriateness of that measure of discount: (15/12/11 20.40 - 21.10T; 08/06/12 2.35 - 45T). The learned Crown Prosecutor who appeared on the appeal argued this was ""generous"", not as a ground of appeal but as a makeweight, apparently.  His Honour then concluded as follows (ROS 43 - 46): 
43. In this matter taking into account the circumstances of the offending, the offender's personal circumstances and his progress so far as rehabilitation is concerned, in my view this is a matter, which must necessarily result in a custodial sentence. I have determined that the sentence is appropriate for Mr. Ball to serve it by way of an intensive corrections order.
44. My reasons for that are first of all the cases that I have spoken of in relation to the range of offending that comes within s86 and the facts as I have found them. Secondly, I accept that Mr. Ball has taken steps towards his rehabilitation beyond which a court usually sees.  In particular I am impressed with the reports of Dr. Bernardi and Mr. San Giovanni and also the intensive correction report in this regard. It seems that Mr. Ball very shortly after his arrest commenced his rehabilitation course. In my view, it is substantial and it is quite clear that he intends to continue with it. I accept that in this case it would not be in the public interest to interfere with that rehabilitation program.  The other reason is, I am impressed with Mr. Ball's genuine remorse and his insight and the steps that he has taken to deal with what was obviously a personal problem producing serious criminal behaviour.  When he gave evidence before me he impressed me with his intentions.
45. I propose to impose a sentence of two years, to be served by an intensive correction order. Mr Ball will you please stand? Mr Ball you are sentenced to imprisonment for a period of two years to be served by an intensive correction order. You have been assessed by officers of the Department. I have a report prepared on 4 June 2012. I am satisfied the report addresses the matters required by cl 14 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  The report states that you are suitable to serve your sentence by an intensive correction order. You are convicted of the offence of taking Vanessa Sprowle without her consent with the intent to obtain an advantage, namely to intimidate her and to have physical control over her and at the time and immediately before the taking, actual bodily harm was occasioned to her.  I sentence you to a period of imprisonment of two years.
46. Pursuant to s7(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I order that the sentence is to be served by way of an intensive correction order in the community. Pursuant to s71(2) of the Act I order that the sentence is to commence on 22 June 2012.
As required by s81 of the Administration Act, his Honour imposed the mandatory conditions stipulated by Clause 175 Administration Regulation.
263His Honour made it clear that in imposing the sentence for the principal offence, he had taken into account ""the matters on the Form 1"".  
264He then moved on to deal with the related summary offence on the s.166 certificate. He did not give a separate exposition of reasons for that matter but dealt with it in the course of discussion with counsel. When the matter had been before the sentencing judge on 15th December 2011 (16.40 - 17.10 T), the learned Crown prosecutor agreed that if the driving offence had been dealt with summarily in the Local Court, a person of the respondent's age, even with his traffic record, would not ""get a gaol sentence"". 
265When the matter was dealt with on 13th June 2012, the Crown position was put to the sentencing judge this way (29.5 T):
[Crown Prosecutor]: While he is sentenced as a person who has no previous offence on a minimum period of disqualification in that situation of 12 months.  It's a 3 year automatic with 12 months minimum.
His Honour:  12 months minimum?
[Crown Prosecutor]: Yes.
His Honour:  Do you agree with that (counsel).
[Defence Counsel]: I do.
His Honour, acting under s.10A Sentencing Act, convicted the respondent of the s.166 matter, but imposed no other penalty, and reduced the period of disqualification to the statutory minimum of 12 months.
Consideration
Grounds 1, 2 and 3
266The Crown, argued these grounds together as I have earlier pointed out.  Essentially the learned Crown Prosecutor, by reference to Dodd at 351 and 354, and R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48 at [54], argued that the sentencing judge had allowed the respondent's subjective features to so far outweigh the objective gravity of the offending that there was no reasonable proportionality between the sentence and the circumstances of the crime.  It was said that only a full time sentence of imprisonment would reflect the objective seriousness of the offence, and that even a period of full-time imprisonment of two years would have been inadequate.  Permitting the respondent to serve the sentence by way of an intensive correction order, given the degree of leniency reflected by such an order, only compounded the error.  Moreover, the nature of the offending was ""brutal, cowardly and inexcusable"" and the domestic context was an aggravating factor calling for strong denunciation.  Additionally, the offences on the Form 1 should have led to a period of full time imprisonment substantially greater that otherwise would be appropriate. Reliance in this regard was placed upon the judgment of Johnson J in R. v. Speechley [2012] NSWCCA 130.  
267Ms. J.S. Manuell SC, who appeared for the respondent, argued by reference to Collett and Robson that: the duration of the detention was short; she acknowledged that during that period the victim would have been terrified which terror would have been exacerbated by the respondent's demeanour and words; there was no rational purpose for the detention other than perhaps psychological gratification in having the opportunity to take the victim to their former home to talk; no other person connected with the victim was otherwise aware of the events so no third party was subject to ordeal or anguish; there was an absence of pre-meditation or planning; allowing for acceptance of the Victim Impact Statement, there was no expert evidence supporting a conclusion that the injuries, physical or emotional, were substantial and requiring any ongoing treatment; so far as the domestic context was concerned, whilst it was questionable whether there was an ongoing relationship at the time of the offending, there was no evidence of any previous violence in the relationship, and there was no real violation of trust given the complete breakdown of trust between both of them having regard to the victim's new relationship. Learned Senior Counsel argued that the objective gravity of the offending was limited by its spontaneity, it's short duration and the relatively minor injuries.  
268Ms. Manuell dealt with Ground 2 in conjunction with Grounds 4 and 7.  However, she stressed that an intensive correction order is a sentence of imprisonment, and in accordance with the established jurisprudence, itself of some significance.  It could not be said, as a matter of law, that it was never appropriate in respect of a s.86 (2)(b) offence.
269In relation to Ground 3, Ms. Manuell argued that the principal offence and the additional offences were all part and parcel of the same episode of criminality and the principle of totality applied.  She argued, with some force, that offences 1 and 2 on the Form 1 were hard to separate from the other assault matters which formed the basis of the element of aggravation of the principal offence.  In truth, offences 3 and 4, damaging the mobile phone, and driving the vehicle without permission, were of significantly lesser importance, and would ordinarily have been dealt with in the Local Court by the imposition of a non-custodial sentence.
Resolution 
270I am satisfied that his Honour did not fall into error in any of the respects complained of by the Crown.  From the analysis of his reasons on sentence as set out above, I find that he correctly identified the importance of the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending in performance of the sentencing task.  He correctly directed himself by reference to relevant authority.  Likewise, he took into account the additional offences on the Form 1, and reminded himself that the operation of s.33(2) Sentencing Act will very commonly lead to an increase in the appropriate sentence for the principal offence.  The effect of taking the additional offences into account may result in the imposition of a substantially longer sentence, but it need not.  Sometimes ""the additional penalty"" (Attorney General's Application) at 155 [18] will be small.  It is fundamental to bear in mind that the Court is sentencing for the principal offence, and not the additional offence.  It is rarely appropriate for a sentencing judge to attempt to quantify the effect on the sentence (Attorney General's Application 159 [44]) and the matters of principle which may lead to the imposition of a more severe sentence are subject to the principle of totality.  (159 [42]).
271As McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ said in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 at 623 [40].
To the extent to which two offences of which an offender stands convicted contain common elements, it will be wrong to punish that offender twice for the commission of the elements that are common.  No doubt that general principle must yield to any contrary legislative intention, but the punishment to be exacted should reflect what an offender has done; it should not be affected by the way in which the boundaries of particular offences are drawn.  Often those boundaries would be drawn in a way that means the offences overlap.  To punish an offender twice if the conduct falls in that area of overlap would be to punish offenders according to the accidents of legislative history, rather than according to their just deserts.
272However, notwithstanding that the additional offences, on the one hand, and the principal offence, on the other, each may have been incidents in an overall episode of criminality, they represent, nonetheless, separate offences: R. v. Merrin [2007] NSWCCA 255; 174 A Crim R 100 [38] - [43]; R. v. XX [2009] NSWCCA 115; 195 A Crim. R. 38 at [52] (especially sub-par. (11)).  To that extent, there must be a tendency for the sentence to be somewhat more severe:  R. v. Harris [2007] NSWCCA 130; 171 A Crim R 267 at 274 [32].  Even so, as Ms. Manuell argued, items 3 and 4 in the Form 1 of themselves did not fall into a category of criminality likely to have attracted a custodial sentence.  Items 1 and 2 were offences against the person very similar in type to the matters which constituted the aggravating element in the principal offence. Indeed, given their temporal proximity to the occurrence of the aggravating element, they could readily have been encompassed by that element of the principal offence. Ultimately, that is a matter for prosecutorial discretion, and not for the judiciary: Jimmy v. The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 60; 77 NSWLR 540 at 230; 596 [247]; and 599 [267].  But the effect that taking these additional offences into account had on the sentence for the principal offence was within the discretionary consideration of the sentencing judge. In my judgment his Honour has not been shown to have fallen into error in this regard.
273It is one thing to say that a s 86(2) offence ought to attract a sentence of imprisonment (the sentencing judge thought so too) and quite another to say a sentence of two years is manifestly inadequate.  Like the sentencing judge, one may accept the major premise, whilst rejecting the minor. A consideration of two cases will illustrate this.  Much reliance was placed upon Speechley where the principles of law referred to by the sentencing judge below were summarised by Johnson J at [51] - [58] (McClellan CJ at CL and Hammerschlag J agreeing).  At [116] Johnson J observed ""that a non-custodial sentence, or suspended sentence, would generally not be appropriate for a s 86(2) offence"".  His Honour referred to R. v. Anforth, the authority referred to by the sentencing judge in this context.  Johnson J added ""in most exceptional circumstances involving misguided motives and the commission of a s 86(3) (sic) offence by a person with no prior convictions where cultural mores played a part, it was accepted that all of the objectives of sentencing could be met by the imposition of a suspended term of imprisonment: R v Davis [2004] NSWCCA 310 at [26]"".
274His Honour went on to find that the offence in Speechley was one of ""significant objective gravity, well above the lower end of the scale"".  Moreover, the offender who had obtained the benefit of a suspended sentence of 1 year and 11 months at first instance had been ""less than enthusiastic in complying with the terms of her bond"".  More significant to Johnson J's way of thinking was a capacity of the offender ""to provide self-serving and misleading accounts concerning [the] action she had taken"" with regard to rehabilitation.  Taking into account these considerations, his Honour thought it appropriate to lift the suspension and to convert the sentence into one of full-time custody with a non-parole period of twelve months with an additional term of eleven months, backdated to the passing of the sentence appealed from.  The offender was nineteen years of age at the time of the offence, but the offence involved a vigilante scenario, supposedly paying-back the victim for a sexual assault upon a friend.  It was premeditated by three offenders, involved handcuffs to restrain the victim, and the use of a firearm and a knife. Verbal threats to inflict really serious personal injury were made.  The victim escaped through his own sharpness of wit.  
275The second case is Williams v. Regina; Saunders v. Regina [2006] NSWCCA 33. One of two offenders, Saunders, was sentenced after a jury verdict of guilty, the other, Williams, after a plea on the day of verdict, for a s.86(2)(a) offence.  The sentencing judge imposed a sentence consisting of a non-parole period of two years and an additional term of two years on both, a total effective sentence for each of four years.  The victim was a juvenile aged fourteen years who had attempted to steal drugs from Saunders.  Williams, in company with Saunders took the victim to a remote place and forced him to dig a hole.  Saunders made threats that the hole would be his bed for the night.  It was not intended to inflict injury on the victim, rather the co-offenders hoped to scare him into providing information about whether anyone else was behind the attempted theft.  The period of detention was two hours.  Williams was not the instigator of the offence and the unlawful detention was already underway when he became involved.
276Hall J reviewed the authorities concerning the objective seriousness of s.86 (2) offences.  His Honour observed at [42]:  
It is fortunate that offences of kidnapping are comparatively rare.  That fact, of course, means that there is therefore no range or ""tariff"" available to guide the sentencing discretion.
277Williams was 30 years of age at the time of the offence, having been raised in a good home.  He received his school certificate and had been in regular full-time employment.  He was separated from his wife with whom he had had two children.  His criminal record contained only minor offences which, Hall J said, ""The sentencing judge correctly disregarded for the purposes of sentencing him and he, as already noted, was properly regarded as a man of good character"".  Hall J referred to the unplanned nature of the offence (at least from Williams point of view) and that it's commission was contrary to the character of Williams. There was no intent to injure, injury was not inflicted and Williams was unlikely to re-offend.  In these circumstances, personal deterrence was not of particular importance.  In Williams' case the sentence was excessive and was quashed. Williams was re-sentenced to a non-parole period of eighteen months with an additional term of twelve months. Basten JA and Howie J agreed.
278What these, albeit isolated, examples demonstrate, in contradiction of the argument advanced on behalf of the Crown, is that there is no principle to the effect that a term of imprisonment of about two years is manifestly inadequate for a s.86(2) offence. And  it is of the essence of a conclusion of manifest inadequacy that the appellate court decides ""that there must have been some misapplication of principle even though where and how is not apparent from the statement of reasons""  (Wong v. The Queen  [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at 605 [58]. (Emphasis added).
279This, with respect, highlights a logical fallacy in the structure of the argument advanced on behalf of the Crown, which it is convenient to identify now.  As I have pointed out, both in writing and orally, the argument separated grounds addressing the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence from those dealing with considerations relevant to questions of leniency.  In my view this invited a wrong approach for the reason explained by the plurality in Wong at 611 [75]:  
[This approach] departs from principle because it does not take account of the fact that there are many conflicting and contradictory elements which bear upon sentencing an offender.  Attributing particular weight to some factors, while leaving the significance of all other factors substantially unaltered, may be quite wrong.  We say ""may be"" quite wrong because the task of the sentencer is to take account of all of the relevant factors and to arrive at a single result which takes due account of all of them.  This is what is meant by saying that the task is to arrive at an ""instinctive synthesis"". This expression is used, not as might be supposed, to cloak the task of the sentencer in some mystery, but to make plain that the sentencer is called upon to reach a single sentence which, in the case of an offence like the one now under discussion, balances many different and conflicting features.  
280Moreover, as I said at the outset, and I mean no disrespect, the casting of the grounds of appeal failed to identify appellable error for this area of discourse with precision.  Rather, and at best, they represented particulars of a single ground of manifest inadequacy.  Care needs to be taken in all sentence appeals to draw the grounds bearing in mind the settled principles which govern the identification of appellable error, as explained in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499. This is necessary for the purpose of better identifying why the appellant, or applicant, says the Court should form the opinion that some other sentence is warranted (s.6(3) Appeal Act), which, after all, is the necessary precondition to the successful prosecution of a sentence appeal, whether by the Crown, or an offender.
281What I have said, at [189]-[198] above, about the recent decisions of this Court concerning intensive correction orders, disposes of Ground 2.  Except as the statute itself provides, there is no principle restraining the use of intensive correction orders.  Moreover, the Crown's argument emphasises the aspect of leniency, but entirely overlooks the significance of the punishment imposed.  The statute, itself, treats the intensive correction order as a means of service of a sentence of imprisonment.  Imprisonment is the most severe form of punishment available.  It may only be imposed when all other options have been considered and discarded.  I repeat, it is not possible to assess, from the point of view of an appellate court, the appropriateness of the order made by the sentencing judge without considering all facts, matters and circumstances relevant to arriving at the appropriate sentence.  The separation of the objective from the subjective in this area invites a court to fall into error.
282Moreover, the argument overlooks what McClellan CJ at CL and Johnson J referred to in R v Pogson at 111 as ""the stringent conditions attached to an ICO"". I will repeat that their Honours said that those conditions ensure that the offender ""is not living a carefree existence amongst the community.  An ICO deprives an offender of his or her liberty in a real and not merely fictional sense"".  As only one example of this, the present respondent, who has full time employment, and the usual family commitments, has an obligation to undertake 32 hours of community service each and every month of the 24 months during which he is serving his sentence.  
283As I have remarked before, in assessing the sentencing judge's reasons for sentence, it is important to bear in mind that the legislation necessarily requires the adoption of a somewhat staged approach to the consideration of whether an intensive correction order is an appropriate means of service of a sentence of imprisonment.  This must have an effect on the form of a sentencing judge's reasons.  Having heard all the evidence, and considered at least in his or her own mind the various alternatives, an intensive correction must have arisen as a matter for serious consideration.  That can only occur if the sentencing judge has in mind that no other option than imprisonment will do for the offence and the offender.  Once the s. 70 assessment is received, it seems to me completely natural, and in accordance with the legislative scheme, that a certain emphasis should be laid upon what one may normally refer to as the subjective aspects of the matter in finally deciding whether a term of imprisonment to be served in the community by way of intensive correction is the single sentence appropriate to the particular circumstances of the case.  One should not infer from the reasons of the sentencing judge in the present case, for that reason, that he gave undue weight to the subjective elements to the disadvantage of the objective seriousness of the offence.  
Grounds 4 and 5 
284I acknowledge that it can probably be said that I have made my views about these matters fairly obvious from what I have written so far.  None the less, it is important to record, however, that the learned Crown Prosecutor did not dispute that the respondent ""was able to demonstrate persuasive subjective circumstances, particularly in terms of his rehabilitation"".  The real argument, as I have said more than once, was that the sentencing judge allowed these considerations to swamp the fundamental consideration of ""the gravity of the offence viewed objectively"":  Dodd at 354.  The Crown emphasised, as the whole Court said in Dodd, that ""without this assessment the other factors requiring consideration in order to arrive at a proper sentence to be imposed cannot properly be given their place"".
285The Crown acknowledged that the issue of mental health was a relevant consideration capable of reducing moral culpability and general deterrence as relevant factors to be enured in the sentence.  I did not understand the Crown to complain about the correctness of the principles applied by the sentencing judge, but rather to argue by reference to Wright at [51] that it is an error to proceed as though the impact of these considerations must always lead to a lesser sentence.  
286Moreover, it was argued that the sentencing judge overlooked the element of choice, or voluntariness, in the respondent combining too much alcohol with Stilnox.  It was argued that the respondent's choice to combine these drugs, to the extent to which the side effects contributed to his criminal conduct, reduced the relevance of his mental illness as a mitigating factor:  Cicekdag v. R [2007] NSWCCA 218 at [42] per James J (Giles JA and Hislop J agreeing).
287Ms. Manuell submitted that there was persuasive evidence that the respondent's mental illness contributed to the commission of the crime, which his Honour was entitled to accept.  There was no evidence that he had committed any previous serious crime, let alone a previous crime whilst affected by the combination of Stilnox and alcohol.  She, properly in my view, emphasised the strength of the subjective case.  She argued that in approaching the sentencing task by application of the instinctive synthesis approach, his Honour was required to take into account all the relevant facts, matters and circumstances including the seriousness of the offending behaviour, which was ameliorated by spontaneity and shortness of duration.  She argued:
[T]he respondent acknowledged his guilt, expressed genuine remorse and provided an explanation as to how he came to offend.  Additionally, the respondent had by the time of the sentence, made fundamental changes to his life.  
By the time he was sentenced he had been of good behaviour on bail for nearly three years, and reporting to the police three times per week. He was not responsible for the delay (neither was the Crown), but he had made good use of his time to address the causes of his offending behaviour and to re-establish himself as an ordinary, worthwhile member of the community.  The sentencing judge accepted that he was deeply remorseful for his offending.  
Resolution 
288As I have already said, I do not consider that the sentencing judge treated the combination of Stilnox and alcohol as a mitigating factor.  Conventionally, he treated this voluntary conduct as providing part of the explanation for why the offences were committed.  Whilst the Crown is undoubtedly correct to argue that the effect of mental illness is not always to reduce the severity of the sentence which might otherwise be imposed:  Veen (No. 2) v. The Queen [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465 and 477; Engert v R (1995) 84 A Crim R 67; obviously it may, and often will.  His Honour made no error of principle, nor did he misapprehend the facts in any relevant way.
289I accept the submission on behalf of the respondent, that the subjective case was a strong one, as the Crown properly conceded.  In particular, I accept that the efforts he had made in the time allowed him before sentence were impressive, and were entitled to full consideration in the sentencing process.  As I have already pointed out, his Honour found that the steps taken by the respondent towards his rehabilitation went ""beyond [that] which a court usually sees"".  In my view, his Honour found, on the basis of evidence not challenged, that the efforts at rehabilitation were substantial and that the respondent intended to continue ""with it"".  His Honour relied upon his advantage in seeing and hearing the respondent to form these conclusions.  The sentencing judge was also impressed with the genuineness of the respondent's remorse and his insight into what caused the offending.
290These considerations, it seems to me, clearly brought into play a legitimate question for the sentencing judge about whether an intensive correction order was an appropriate means of serving a sentence of imprisonment in this case. 
291As I have already stated, in R. v  Pogson (at [117]), McClellan CJ at CL and Johnson J referred to the judgment of King CJ in Vartzokas at 279. I set out the full passage:
The passage which I have quoted from the remarks of the learned sentencing magistrate discloses, in my opinion, an error of principle. It implies that rehabilitation or reform, as an object of sentencing, is confined to those who are in need of rehabilitation by reason of factors such as illness or being ""predisposed to such behaviour by his environment or his experiences of life"", that is to say, to persons subject to some personal or social disadvantage. That involves a misconception of the meaning of rehabilitation and its place in the sentencing process.
Rehabilitation as an object of sentencing is aimed at the renunciation by the offender of his wrongdoing and his establishment or re-establishment as an honourable law-abiding citizen. It is not confined to those who fall into wrongdoing by reason of physical or mental infirmity or a disadvantaged background. It applies equally to those who, while not suffering such disadvantages, nevertheless lapse into wrongdoing. The object of the courts is to fashion sentencing measures designed to reclaim such individuals wherever such measures are consistent with the primary object of the criminal law which is the protection of the community. Very often a person who is not disadvantaged and whose character has been formed by a good upbringing, but who has lapsed into criminal behaviour, will be a good subject for rehabilitative measures precisely because he possesses the physical and mental qualities and, by reason of his upbringing, the potential moral fibre to provide a sound basis for rehabilitation. It would be a great mistake to put considerations of rehabilitation aside in fashioning a sentence for such a person.
In my judgment, this statement of principle is directly applicable to the circumstances of the present case:  s.3A (d).  These considerations, in my view, once the sentencing judge decided that a term of imprisonment was the only appropriate alternative, brought s.7 directly into consideration in the particular circumstances of this case.
292I am not satisfied an error has been demonstrated in this regard.
Ground 7 - Manifest Inadequacy
293The arguments of counsel have been addressed previously and I have already set out the substance of my views.  The Crown's complaint goes both to the length of the sentence and the means by which it is to be served.  
294I accept the Crown's submission that the offending involved elements of brutality and cowardice, and that these matters call for denunciation.  ""Inexcusable"" is an unhelpful word in this context.  The primary function of punishment, as King CJ said, is the protection of society.  And when punishment is imposed, the law does not excuse, but condemns. The sentencing judge did not excuse the respondent's offending, he imposed a punishment for it.  The sentencing judge, as I have already set out, was well aware of the importance of the protection of the community as an object of punishment, and of the significance of rehabilitation to achieve that object.
295The aspect of violence in the domestic context also called for denunciation.  However, for the reasons I have expressed in dealing with the facts relating to the relationship between the respondent and the victim, this consideration in the particular circumstances of the present case may be somewhat attenuated.  It seems to me they were not in a current relationship and that there was an element of mutual distrust between them.  There was certainly no evidence, as I have said, that the respondent was a recidivist in this regard:  see s. 21A(2)(d) Sentencing Act.  
296In any event, by concluding that a term of imprisonment was necessary the sentencing judge was giving effect to the need for denunciation.  By making that decision he was imposing a punishment.  The choice of the mode of service by way of an intensive correctional order for the reasons already set out at too much length, whilst somewhat more lenient than a term of full-time custody, represents significant punishment.  I would reject this ground of appeal.
Ground 6 - The disposal of the charge of driving in a manner dangerous
297The learned Crown Prosecutor argued that the dangerous driving offence was a serious example of offending of that type which warranted a significant penalty in it's own right.  It was argued that the respondent's traffic record did not justify leniency.  These considerations were not adequately reflected by dealing with the matter under s.10A Sentencing Act, even with the period of disqualification.  
298Ms. Manuell argued as follows:
(a)By definition, the driving matter, whilst serious arose in ""substantially the same circumstances"" as those of the principal offence.  Accordingly there was a need to avoid double punishment especially as the detention of the victim in this case was constituted by the driving.  In addition to the passage from Pearce referred to above, Senior Counsel referred to R v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; 147 CLR 383;
(b)To the extent to which the conduct put the public at risk, this occurred over a short period and short distance.  The temporal and spatial risk was slight, and did not materialise;
(c)The 12 month disqualification was a significant penalty given his full time employment and the obligations he had undertaken under the intensive correction order.
(d)The totality principle needed to be borne in mind.  
Resolution
299In my judgment, it is not open to the Crown to complain about this aspect of the sentence, given the concessions that were made at first instance, which I have fully recounted above at [264]-[265]: Everett v The Queen [1994] HCA 49; 181 CLR 295 at 300 and 302-3 per Brennan, Deane, Dawson, and Gaudron JJ. I accept also Ms. Manuell's argument that there is a particular need in dealing separately with this particular offence to avoid double punishment in the manner discussed in Pearce.
300I fully accept the force of the Crown's submissions that the respondent's traffic record did not entitle him to leniency.  However, he had only been dealt with by a court once in respect of any traffic offence and that matter had the unusual feature that the charge which empowered the police officer to suspend the respondent's licence, which was the foundation of the driving whilst disqualified charge, was never proceeded with, and was in fact withdrawn. As I have already said, I am not suggesting that the police suspension was unlawful, or that the respondent was not bound by it.  I am simply pointing out the circumstances relating to the prior court ordered disqualification.  In the circumstances, its significance as evidence of habitual, or serious, disregard of the requirements of the traffic code was reduced.
301In all the circumstances the concessions made by the prosecution at first instance left it open to the judge to deal with this driving offence in the way he did.  I would reject this ground of appeal.  
Decision
302I am not of the opinion that any other sentence was warranted in law and accordingly I would dismiss the s.5D appeal; in the s.5DB appeal I would confirm the sentence below.  
303Lest my opinion is wrong and the appeal ought to be allowed, I would exercise the Court's discretion to decline to interfere with the sentences below even if they are erroneously lenient:  Green v. The Queen at [1] - [2]; [36]; and [112]. At 479-480 [43] the Justices constituting the majority said:
Other circumstances may combine to produce injustice if a Crown appeal is allowed. They include delay in the hearing and determination of the appeal, the imminent or past occurrence of the respondent's release on parole or unconditionally, and the effect of re-sentencing on progress towards the respondent's rehabilitation. They are relevant to the exercise of the residual discretion. The guidance afforded to the sentencing judges by allowing the appeal should not come at too high a cost in terms of justice to the individual. (Emphasis added.)
304As Johnson J pointed out in Speechley at [146]:
From time to time, this Court has declined to re-sentence an offender on a Crown appeal, despite error having been established, because of solid and substantial evidence of rehabilitative steps taken by the offender between the time of sentence and the hearing of the appeal (citations omitted)
305In accordance with the usual practice, the Court received additional evidence in the event that it was necessary to re-sentence the respondent.  An affidavit from his current supervisor confirmed that he continues to be employed in a responsible position in the finance sector and that he is highly regarded by his superiors.  His supervisor describes him as a ""model employee"" and otherwise speaks very highly of his personal qualities and character.  In his own affidavit, the respondent confirms that he has in all respects complied with the conditions of the intensive correction order, and his undertaking.  In addition to his full time employment, he performs his community service each Saturday, performing what I would infer is menial physical work in a group cleaning up Sydney's foreshores.  Sometimes the work is performed on a Sunday by prior agreement with the Probation and Parole Service.  An officer of the service visits his home regularly.  He is subject to regular drug and alcohol checks, which he affirms he has never failed.  He has remained substantially abstinent and has successfully undertaken a course of study relevant to his work and intends further study to advance himself.
306He has formed a new stable relationship and he and his partner have recently celebrated the birth of their first child.
307I would infer from this evidence that the process of correction remarked upon by the learned sentencing judge at the time of sentencing has continued and that the intensive correction order is serving its statutory purpose.  I would also infer, to adapt the language of King CJ, that subsequent events have demonstrated that the respondent has proved himself to be a good subject for rehabilitative measures because ""he possesses the physical and mental qualities, and by reason of his upbringing... the moral fibre to provide a sound basis for rehabilitation"".  
308Three years and eight months have now elapsed since the commission of the offence.  This delay, though not the fault of either party, is relevant to the question under consideration.  Almost, but not quite, from the time of the commission of his offences, the respondent has by his deeds demonstrated that the principal offence (and the related additional offences) was in truth an aberration in one who is otherwise of good character.  In my view, it would be a great mistake to risk derailing the good that the intensive correction order has served by requiring the respondent to serve, even a short, term of full-time imprisonment.
309I would, were it necessary, exercise the residual discretion to decline to interfere with the sentence actually imposed in this case.
The orders I propose are:
(i)In relation to the appeal brought under s.5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912, appeal dismissed.
(ii)In relation to the appeal brought under s.5DB of the said Act, sentence confirmed.

2706687,R v Ahola (No 7) [2013] NSWSC 704,"EX TEMPORE Judgment

1The Crown Prosecutor has indicated that in his final address to the jury he proposes to rely on one alleged lie of the accused as demonstrating consciousness of guilt on his part. At my invitation, and in accordance with the authorities, he has identified it with precision. 

Review of Evidence

2At the scene on the evening of 18 October 2011, the accused informed a number of police officers that he had attempted to contact Senior Sergeant Wanklin in Queensland by telephone. He referred to having rung but not getting through. 

3References in the trial transcript are as follows. In the evidence of Senior Constable McLean at T522.37 the following appears. Recounting what the accused had said in answer to a question from Senior Constable Schmidt at Yugura Street, Senior Constable McLean gave evidence that the accused said at the scene on the evening of 18 October 2011: 

""Yeah I was talking to her about dinner then I went out and sat out the back and had a smoke. I walked back inside the kitchen and saw blood on the floor. I then started yelling out for her and found her in the bathroom floor. I moved the stick away and checked her pulse and heartbeat. There was nothing I could do. I rang Ron, he's a cop in Queensland. After that I went out the back and sat down and had a drink and a smoke."" 

4In the evidence of Senior Constable Schmidt at T655 the following appears, at T654.50 and following:

""'Yeah, I was talking to her about dinner and then I went and sat out the back and had a drink and a smoke. I walked back in the kitchen and saw blood near the front door. I started yelling out for her and found her on the bathroom floor covered in blood. I moved the stick away and checked her pulse and heartbeat, there was nothing I could do. I rang Ron, he's a cop from Queensland. After that I went out the back and I sat down and I had a drink and a smoke...'""

5Although that evidence of the conversation is not word for word identical with the passage from the evidence of Senior Constable McLean to which I referred a moment ago, I approach it as evidence of the same exchange in conversation.

6Later on at T655.26, the following appears in the evidence of Senior Constable Schmidt:

""Senior Constable McLean said, 'When did you ring him up?' He said, 'When I found her lying there dead. She always told me if anything happened to her for me to ring Ron. I rang him but I' [I interpolate that should be 'he'] 'wasn't available so I went back out the back and had another drink.'"" 

7From the preceding paragraph of the transcript commencing at T655.16, it is clear that the person under discussion in that portion that I have extracted is the Detective ""Ron"" from Queensland.

8In the evidence of Senior Constable Quick at T540.41, the following statement of the accused at the scene appears:

""'then I walked in the front door and saw that stuff on the floor (blood) and thought she spilt red wine. I then walked into the bathroom and saw her there. I'm first aid trained. I felt her neck and wrist and stuff it she's been murdered. I moved the stick or something away from her, I then rang that copper in Queensland but I couldn't get through to him. I then walked out the back, had another glass of wine and then called you guys'.""

9In an ERISP conducted in the early hours of the morning of 19 October 2011 the accused said:

""Q197. All right. So after you, can you tell me what you did after you gave Ms Thomson the CPR pressure?

A. I felt for, I felt for a pulse again.

Q198. All right.

A. There wasn't any.

Q199. All right.

A. And I just had to leave the scene then"".

10A little later the following appears:

""Q203. O.K. So then you said, can you tell me what you did after you left the bathroom?

A. I went back out the back of the house where the cask of wine was and proceeded to have a few drinks out of that and made several phone calls"".


11A little later at question 208 the following appears:

""Q208. All right. Now, you've also told me that you've made some phone calls.

A. Yes, I did.

Q209. Can you tell me who you called?

A. Well, Sandra had told me if she ever got into any sort of trouble, to call some Detective Sergeant Don, I can't recollect the surname now, but over, what's the name, Brisbane there, a Fortitude Valley detective in Brisbane. I attempted to get in touch with him"".

12Despite the submission of defence counsel, I consider that in the ERISP the accused was saying that he had rung the police officer in Queensland but was unable to be put through to him. That interpretation of what the accused was saying in the ERISP in the portions that I have extracted is wholly consistent with exhibit Y, which is the disk of the call, and MFI 42, which is the transcript of the call that has been provided to the jury for their convenience.

13By way of contrast, in his evidence the accused said that he had rung earlier in the day after having seen a suspicious vehicle. At T1044.44, when being asked by his counsel about that call, the following appears:

""Q. And about what time was it that you made this call?

A. I didn't make any note of the time or anything, it was late in the afternoon"".

14A preceding question and answer made it clear that the accused was saying that at the time of the call to Queensland the deceased was undoubtedly alive. That appears at 1044.37 as follows:

""Q. And did she say anything to you at that time as to why it was she wanted you to contact this policeman up in Queensland?

A. No she didn't. She just wanted me to ring up for her"".

15Later, the accused made it clear in his evidence that the call in question occurred before he spoke to his mother by telephone that evening. At T1047.28 and following this appears: 

""Q. So you spoke - you phoned your mother, had a conversation then a short time later she phoned you back?

A. Yes.

Q. You are saying it was after that, that you spoke to the Queensland Police switchboard operator?

A. It was before that.

Q. It was before that?

A. Yes, these phone calls from my mother were after the phone call to the switchboard operator.

Q. So how long before you spoke to your mother did you speak to the switchboard operator?

A. Well I was in the process of cheering Sandy up when the telephone calls with my mother occurred.""

16Again, that last exchange demonstrates that the accused was certainly saying in his evidence that at the time of the call to Queensland the deceased was alive.

17Finally, in my review of the evidence, although the phone records do not identify clearly when the accused had the phone conversations with his mother, that lady gave undisputed evidence that she spoke to the accused after 7pm, and I derive that assertion from T917.46 of the transcript of the evidence in the trial.

Determination

18It is noteworthy that the Crown is not saying that it is a lie of the accused that has the potential of demonstrating consciousness of guilt that the call did not take place at 9.13pm on 18 October 2011. That proposition - namely that the telephone records are wrong, to the extent that they suggest that the call did indeed take place at 9.13pm that evening - is after all part of the defence case that is going to the jury. It would be bootstrapping of the kind discussed by Brennan CJ in Edwards v The Queen [1993] HCA 63; (1993) 178 CLR 193, and therefore inappropriate. Reference should also be made to the discussion in the more recent decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Lane [2011] NSWCCA 157. 

19I respectfully agree with the decision of the Crown Prosecutor not to seek to rely on the assertion of the accused that the call did not take place at 9.13pm as a lie potentially evidencing consciousness of guilt.

20However, whether the deceased was alive or dead at the time of the call to Queensland, although related, is to my mind a separate issue. I respectfully reject the submission of defence counsel that the two issues are so inextricably linked that it would be impossible for the jury to separate them out in consideration of this proposed submission of the learned Crown Prosecutor.

21I consider that such a statement - namely that the deceased was dead at the time of the call to Queensland - has the potential to pass the tests delineated in Edwards v The Queen and paraphrased at [56] in R v Lane in the judgment of Simpson J. They are:

(1)That the statement was made by the accused.

(2)That the statement was untrue.

(3)That the statement was deliberately untrue and not the result of mistake, confusion, shock, a crossed wire and so forth.

(4)That the statement related to a material issue in this murder trial. 

It will be recalled that the central issue in the trial is whether the accused either murdered the deceased or innocently found her, she having been murdered by another or others.

(5)That the lie was told due to an awareness that the truth would reveal the guilt of the accused. 

It will be recalled that it is an important part of the case for the accused, and it was his position on 18 and 19 October 2011, that he never saw the deceased alive after he left for the IGA at Malua Bay the second time, some time before 8pm on 18 October 2011.

(6)Finally, a statement said to be a lie must clearly be shown to be a lie by admission or evidence. 

Careful listening to exhibit Y reveals a female voice in the background to whom the accused is referring when seeking to track down Senior Sergeant Wanklin. And in any event, as I have shown, the evidence of the accused, and the defence case, is that the deceased was indeed alive at the time of the call under consideration.

22I do not consider that, properly presented to the jury, the lie proposed to be relied upon by the Crown Prosecutor falls foul of the logical and legal prohibition against bootstrapping.

23Nor do I consider that there is any basis for limiting the use of the evidence in my discretion pursuant to s 136 of the Evidence Act 1995.

24In short, in the circumstances, I consider that the Crown Prosecutor should be permitted to address the jury in the way foreshadowed about the lie that has been precisely identified. Of course, careful directions about that topic will be required of me, including perhaps a written direction. All of that is a separate question, and can be the subject of separate discussion with counsel at the appropriate time.

		03 June 2013",2013-05-26 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2706688,BJS v R [2013] NSWCCA 123,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL:
Background
The Appellant appeals from a judgment of Finnane DCJ in respect of an indictment containing eleven counts involving four complainants. Those complainants were:
PR
K-AC
MG
LH

2Set out hereunder are short particulars of the terms of the indictment:

Count 1: Between 1 February 1976 - 31 December 1977 did indecently assault PR, contrary to s76 Crimes Act 1900 (she being under the age of 16, namely 11 or 12).

Count 2: Between 1 February 1976 - 31 December 1977 did indecently assault PR, contrary to s76 Crimes Act 1900 (she being under the age of 16, namely 11 or 12).

Count 3: Between 1 January 1979 - 31 December 1979 did indecently assault K-AC, contrary to s76 Crimes Act 1900 (she being under the age of 16, namely 12 or 13).

Count 4: Between 1 January 1979 - 31 December 1979 did indecently assault K-AC, contrary to s76 Crimes Act 1900 (she being under the age of 16, namely 12 or 13).

Count 5: Between 1 January 1980 - 30 June 1980 did indecently assault MG, contrary to s76 Crimes Act 1900 (she being under the age of 16, namely 7 or 8).

Count 6: Between 1 January 1980 - 30 June 1980 did indecently assault MG, contrary to s76 Crimes Act 1900 (she being under the age of 16, namely 7 or 8).

Count 7: Between 1 January 1981 - 30 June 1981 did indecently assault MG, contrary to s76 Crimes Act 1900 (she being under the age of 16, namely 8 or 9).

Count 8: Between 1 January 1981 - 30 June 1981 did indecently assault MG, contrary to s76 Crimes Act 1900 (she being under the age of 16, namely 8 or 9).

Count 9: Between 1 January 1981 - 30 June 1981 did indecently assault MG, contrary to s76 Crimes Act 1900 (she being under the age of 16, namely 8 or 9).

Count 10: Between 1 January 1981 - 12 July 1981 did indecently assault MG, contrary to s76 Crimes Act 1900 (she being under the age of 16, namely 9).

Count 11: On or about 20 May 1981 did indecently assault LH, contrary to s76 Crimes Act 1900 (she being under the age of 16 years).

3A number of pre-trial applications were heard by the trial judge between 27 September and 29 October 2010. They included an application for separate trials in respect of each of the complainants referred to in the indictment, and that all purported tendency and coincidence evidence be excluded.

4Statements were tendered and evidence was called on the voir dire. The Crown called the four complainants, three proposed tendency witnesses, two psychologists who had treated one complainant and one tendency witness. The defence called a psychiatrist, Dr Roberts, to give evidence regarding the treatments of the complainant and the witness. The Crown called Dr Ellis, psychiatrist, in response.

5Judgments were delivered on 27 October and 29 October 2010 (reasons delivered subsequently). The trial judge determined that the evidence of the complainants and the tendency witnesses should be admitted in relation to each complainant. The coincidence evidence was excluded. His Honour refused the application for separate trials. His Honour also refused to allow evidence to be led by the defence concerning psychological treatments upon the complainant and the tendency witness.

6The trial commenced on 2 November 2010. During the course of the trial, two jurors were discharged. His Honour summed up to the jury on 23 and 24 November 2010. The jury retired to consider its verdict on 24 November 2010.

7On 29 November 2010 the jury returned guilty verdicts on counts 5 and 6 (two of the six counts concerning MG) and count 11 (the sole count on the indictment concerning LH). The jury were given a ""Black direction"" regarding the remaining counts.

8On 30 November 2010 the jury returned verdicts of guilty on counts 1 and 2 (the two counts on the indictment concerning PR) and counts 7 - 10 (being the remaining four counts on the indictment concerning MG). The jury were unable to decide on counts 3 and 4, being the two counts on the indictment concerning K-AC.

9The Appellant was sentenced on 19 April 2012. His Honour imposed an aggregate sentence of 9 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years, to date from 30 November 2010. 

10A Notice of Appeal was filed on 27 July 2012. The Appellant relies upon nine Grounds of Appeal in support of the appeal against conviction and one Ground of Appeal in support of the application for leave to appeal against sentence.

11The Grounds of Appeal are:

1. That the trial miscarried as a result of the trial judge ordering that all of the counts of each complainant be tried together.

2. That the trial miscarried as a result of the trial judge permitting the Crown to rely upon tendency evidence.

3. That the trial miscarried as a result of the trial judge finding that evidence of the complainant MG and witness CP having undergone modalities of treatment such as hypnosis was irrelevant to the issue of those witnesses' reliability and thus his Honour's refusal to exclude the evidence of such witnesses upon the joint trial of each of the counts.

4. That the trial miscarried as a result of the trial judge upholding objection pursuant to the provision of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (Sexual Assault Communications Privilege) so as to prevent the defendant being permitted to cross-examine CP and MG about the content of the counselling sessions upon the trial of the Appellant.

5. That the trial miscarried as a result of the trial judge excluding evidence in the defence case sought to be called from Dr John Albert Roberts and in particular such evidence bearing upon the reliability of witnesses MG and CP.

6. That the trial miscarried as a result of his Honour refusing to discharge the jury in circumstances where the Crown was permitted to adduce evidence of the psychiatric history of witness ""Y"" despite his Honour earlier ruling that such evidence was not relevant to the issues to be tried.

7. That the trial miscarried as a result of the trial judge's ruling that the Crown Prosecutor be permitted to cross-examine the Appellant.

8. That the trial miscarried as a result of the trial judge's refusal to discharge the jury consequent upon permitting the Crown Prosecutor to cross-examine the Appellant as to tendency.

9. That the trial miscarried as a result of the trial judge directing the jury after they commenced their deliberations that they
could ""reluctantly agree"" as to their verdict.

10. That the sentence imposed upon the Appellant was too severe.

Factual Background

12The Crown presented the following case. The Appellant was a Catholic priest. On a number of occasions he had taken advantage of his position as a priest to sexually assault young girls.

13In relation to counts 1 and 2, PR was aged 11 and was living in a northwestern country town. She was the daughter of a devout Catholic woman. The Appellant knew two brothers of PR because they attended a boarding school with which he was from time to time associated. He stayed in the home of PR on four occasions in a spare bedroom. He was welcomed by the mother, who did not on any occasion specifically invite him to come. 

14The first incident occurred when only PR and a sister aged five were in the home. The Appellant and PR were in the kitchen when he asked her to come and sit on his lap and give him a cuddle. She did this, sitting sideways on his legs. He then forcefully put his fingers between her legs and her clothes and pushed them into her vagina. PR who was wearing shorts felt very frightened and jumped off his knees and moved away from him.

15PR had her back to him and was facing the sink. She then felt his hand around her throat and was pushed towards the stove. He then began pushing into her bottom from behind and she felt something hard pressing against her. He then took one hand off her throat and proceeded to pull down her pants and her underpants, until they were nearly all the way down below her buttocks. She felt too frightened to call out. The Appellant said ""Just stay there"". She heard the front door slam shut. He then pulled up her pants and moved away. Her sister saw part of what happened. She did not tell her mother what happened. Some years later she told one of her brothers.

16In relation to counts 5 - 10, it was the Crown case that the offences committed against MG started when she was aged 8. MG lived with her parents and her sister in a house in a suburb of Sydney. The Appellant was a priest in the local parish church. Her parents were devout Catholics and welcomed his visits to the home. He would often stay for dinner and would sometimes entertain the family by playing a clarinet. 

17The Appellant gained access to the bedroom of MG and her sister by telling their parents that he would say night prayers with them. At first that is what he did, but after a while, when he had finished the prayers, he would molest MG. Count 5 involved him hugging her hard and then kissing her hard on the mouth. This happened six to eight weeks after she first met him.

18Count 6 concerned an incident a few weeks after the first one. The Appellant again came into the bedroom, ostensibly to say prayers, but then kissed MG hard on the mouth forcing his tongue inside her mouth, causing her breathing difficulties and scratching her face with his. This then happened many times in 1980 and 1981 and she learned to kiss him back to make it easier to breathe.

19Count 7 concerned an incident in 1981 when the Appellant came to the house during the day. While her mother was on the telephone in the kitchen, the Appellant grabbed MG in the lounge-room, picked her up and forced his tongue into her mouth. This caused her considerable anxiety because she thought her mother would come in and she would be in trouble.

20Counts 8 and 9 involved the Appellant coming into her room and lying on top of her. At the time she was aged nine. The Appellant used to press his groin onto hers, place her hand on his penis, which was hard, and then roll around on top of her and rub his penis onto her hand and her legs.

21Count 10 involved the Appellant getting into bed with MG, kissing her and putting pressure on her vaginal area, moving his body around on her. She was aged 9 at the time. MG later found out from her older sister, MM, that he was doing the same sort of thing to her. 

22LH was aged 15 when she met the Appellant. She was attending a western suburbs Catholic school at the time. He used to attend the school to say mass and as school chaplain. In 1981, one of her close friends was killed in a car accident. A number of friends came to her house to console her over the loss. The Appellant arrived uninvited before midday and said mass for all those present. He then asked to see LH privately and persuaded her to get in a car with him. This car was so placed that it was not visible from her house. He then started talking to her about the different sorts of love that existed, mentioning sexual love and the love Jesus had for them. 

23The Appellant then started touching her on the hands and forearms and her knee and leg while holding her hands. She tried to pull away, but he kept persisting and eventually put his hand under her dress and grabbed her in the crotch, around the vaginal area. She broke away from him. She saw him a few times after this but largely tried to avoid him. He sent her a letter and when she said she did not have it, he sent her more letters. She destroyed all of them except one which became an exhibit in the trial.

24Evidence as to tendency was given by MM, an older sister of MG. Their mother used to regularly invite the Appellant to the family home on a weekly basis. The Appellant would bring scotch for the father and sugar coated peanuts for MM and MG. The Appellant used to say prayers with the sisters at bedtime. 

25After bedtime prayers, the Appellant would routinely enter the bedroom of MM with the light off and close the door until it was ajar. On the first few occasions, the Appellant sat on the bed, said prayers and then placed his hand on her head and gave a blessing before leaving. The routine started to change subtly over time. The Appellant told MM that he loved her, and started hugging her and kissing her on the lips. He was putting his tongue into her mouth and kissing her very violently while holding her in an overpowering hug. The Appellant used to lie on MM, suffocating her while kissing her violently. MM remembered feeling scared, helpless and repulsed. This went on for about a year and stopped when the family went overseas in 1981. 

26The Crown called evidence from SS, as tendency evidence. Her family used to attend a Catholic Church in Victoria. SS met the Appellant, who was a priest at this church, in 1981 when she was 9 - 10 years old. He attended the family home on four or five occasions.

27At the end of 1981, after attending a family New Year's Eve function, the Appellant went back to the house of SS at the family's request. While her parents were in the kitchen, the Appellant, who was sitting on a beanbag in the lounge-room, asked SS to sit beside him. When she did, he pulled her into the beanbag and put his arms around her, holding her close. She felt as if she could not get away. He then kissed SS on the lips. He placed his lips on her lips and left them there for several seconds and then took them off before once again kissing her on the lips. She observed that the Appellant's eyes were closed during this kissing. SS said that she felt scared and uneasy. The kissing stopped just before her parents returned from the kitchen.

28The Crown called CP to give tendency evidence. In 1983 CP was 16 - 17 years old, attended a school in Queensland and was a member of the local parish. The Appellant started visiting the family home. During these visits, the Appellant started getting closer to CP and he would put his arm ""around her and things like that"". The Appellant started placing his hand down the back of the shorts of CP on the skin around the buttock area, or if they were sitting at a table, on the inside of her upper thigh. CP was too afraid to react when this touching occurred. She was confused that a priest was doing this. 

29On another occasion, the Appellant was driving CP to school when he pulled up before the school grounds. When CP said goodbye, the Appellant leaned over and gave her a passionate kiss, sticking his tongue in her mouth. 

30On another occasion, when the Appellant was sleeping at the family home of CP, he entered her bedroom while she was asleep. She awoke to find the Appellant in bed with her. The Appellant was on top of her with all of his weight pinning her down, pumping his groin area against her groin area. The Appellant had a dressing gown on with nothing under it. CP failed in her attempts to push him off. The Appellant rolled off her only after the pumping became quite ""frenzied"" and ended with a ""great big grunt"". The Appellant said ""You better go clean yourself up"". In the toilet she found that she was ""rather wet and sticky in the pubic groin area"". He told CP after the event that he had told her mother what had happened. The Appellant also gave CP a gold chain and cross. A month later, CP spoke about the event to her mother because she had not had a period yet and was concerned that she may have been pregnant as a result of what had happened in the bed with the Appellant.

Ground 1: That the trial miscarried as a result of the trial judge ordering that all of the counts of each complainant be tried together.

Ground 2: That the trial miscarried as a result of the trial judge permitting the Crown to rely upon tendency evidence.

31The tendency sought to be proved was the Appellant's tendency to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind, namely:

(a) Having a sexual interest in seven to seventeen year old girls.

(b) To engage in sexual activities with seven to seventeen year old girls.

(c) To use his past relationships with families to gain access to seven to seventeen year old girls so that he could engage in sexual activities with them.

(d) To use his social relationships with the families to obtain access to seven to seventeen year old girls so that he could engage in sexual activities with them.

(e) To use his position of authority to obtain access to seven to seventeen year old girls so that he could engage in sexual activities with them.

32The particular activities which the Appellant was alleged to have engaged in which demonstrated the tendencies were kissing on the mouth, placing his tongue inside the mouth, lying on top of the complainants and witnesses, rubbing against the complainants and witnesses and touching the complainants and witnesses in the vaginal area. The common link was the use by the Appellant of his social and pastoral relationship with the families to obtain access to the young girls so that he could engage in sexual activities with them.

33There was no issue that the Crown had served notice of the intention to lead tendency evidence, pursuant to s97 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). The position of the defence was that there should be four separate trials with no tendency/coincidence evidence to be called in any trial.

34The defence at trial submitted that the proposed tendency evidence did not have the requisite significant probative value because there was:

(i) A lack of similarity between the alleged conduct on the various occasions.

(ii) A lack of similarity of the circumstances in which the alleged conduct took place.

(iii) A risk of concoction and contamination of the proposed tendency evidence.

(iv) A complainant, MG, and a tendency witness, CP, who had undergone psychological treatment which could have distorted their memory and thus affected the probative value of their evidence.

35Section 97 of the Evidence Act relevantly provides:

""97 The tendency rule

(1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person's character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind unless:

(a) the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party's intention to adduce the evidence, and

(b) the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.

...""

36Section 101 of the Evidence Act relevantly provides:

""101 Further restrictions on tendency evidence and coincidence evidence adduced by prosecution

(1) This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sections 97 and 98.

(2) Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the [defendant/accused] unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the [defendant/accused].

...""

37No issue arose as to the power of the prosecution to have the various counts heard together on the basis that they formed part of a ""series of offences of the same or a similar character"" within the terms of s29(1)(c) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). Rather, the Appellant relied upon the power of the Court to order separate trials, pursuant to s21 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 which relevantly provides:

""21 Orders for amendment of indictment, separate trial and postponement of trial

...

(2) If of the opinion:

(a) that an accused person may be prejudiced or embarrassed in his or her defence by reason of being charged with more than one offence in the same indictment, or

(b) that for any other reason it is desirable to direct that an accused person be tried separately for any one or more offences charged in an indictment,

the court may order a separate trial of any count or counts of the indictment.

...""

38Gibbs CJ in De Jesus v R [1986] HCA 65; 61 ALJR 1 referred to an established line of authority in cases involving sexual offences that ""The charges should not be tried together if the evidence on one count is not admissible on another count"": citing Sutton v R [1984] HCA 5; 152 CLR 528 at 531. In De Jesus, Brennan J (at [7]) and Dawson J (at [10]) accepted that approach without adopting categorical language. Dawson J noted that the concept of a ""series"" of offences appeared to impose an additional characteristic beyond the fact that the offences must be of the same or a similar character, while noting that similarity was itself a feature capable of enabling the offences to be described as a series, quoting Lord Pearson in Ludlow v Metropolitan Police Commissioner [1971] AC 29 at 39.

39The general principle that there should be separate trials, unless the evidence to be called in respect of one count is admissible in respect of another, was accepted without demur by the parties. Accordingly, the motion for separate trials was effectively to be determined by the ruling on the admissibility of the tendency evidence.

40There was no challenge to the requirement that the various counts involved a series of offences of the same or a similar character, for the purposes of s29(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act. Rather, issue was joined over the proper application of s21(2), i.e., the Court's power to order separate trials. It was accepted that the power was engaged wherever evidence admissible in respect of one count was inadmissible in respect of another. Once engaged, it was further accepted that the power should properly be exercised.

41In this way, the issues were narrowed to the operation of the rules of evidence with respect to tendency and coincidence evidence. The prosecution proposed to rely upon evidence which was admissible with respect to one count in relation to each of the other counts, either as demonstrating a tendency on the part of the Appellant to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind or to demonstrate the improbability that particular events occurred ""coincidentally"". 

42His Honour ruled against the coincidence evidence, but allowed the evidence as to tendency with the exception of the evidence of two persons (FH and AB). Accordingly, the success of Ground of Appeal 1 depends upon whether his Honour properly admitted the evidence as to tendency.

43Propensity/tendency evidence was explained in Pfennig v R [1995] HCA 7; 182 CLR 461 at 488 by Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ:

""72 Propensity evidence (including evidence of bad disposition and prior criminality) has always been treated as evidence which has or is likely to have a prejudicial effect in the sense explained. That is because the ordinary person naturally (a) thinks that a person who has an established propensity whenever opportunity arises has therefore yielded to the propensity in the circumstances of the particular case and (b) may ignore the possibility that persons of like propensity may have done the act complained of. Hence, the necessity to find something in the evidence or in its connection with the events giving rise to the offences charged which endows it with a high level or degree of cogency.""

44That test no longer applies under the Evidence Act. The general law principles have been varied. The exclusion, subject to exceptions, is set out in s97 and is subject to the further restriction imposed by s101.

45The language of s97(1)(b) refers to the evidence having ""significant"" probative value. This is not consistent with the requirement under the general law that there be no rational explanation for the evidence, apart from its cogency in respect of the charge. Further, the balancing test required by s101(2) is inconsistent with a general requirement as to probative value in terms of the Pfennig test. As explained by Spigelman CJ (with whom Sully, O'Keefe, Hidden JJ agreed) in R v Ellis [2003] NSWCCA 319; 58 NSWLR 700 at [95]:

""The ""no rational explanation"" test focuses on one only of the two matters to be balanced - by requiring a high test of probative value - thereby averting any balancing process. I am unable to construe section 101(2) to that effect.""

Section 101(2) ""requires the Court to make a judgment, rather than to exercise a discretion"": (Ellis at [95]). That approach was confirmed by a further five judge court in DAO v R [2011] NSWCCA 63 at [40] (Spigelman CJ); [98] cf at [171] - [173] (Simpson J).

46In an evaluative judgment, the criterion is identified by the applicable statute or the general law. 

47""Probative value"" is defined in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act:

""Probative value"" of evidence means the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue.""

No guidance is given as to the meaning of the adjective ""significant"". It does not mean ""substantial"". It has been held to mean something more than mere relevance, but something less than a ""substantial"" degree of relevance. It has also been held that the evidence must be ""important"" or ""of consequence"", recognising that: 

""The significance of the probative value of the tendency evidence must depend upon the nature of the fact in issue to which it is relevant and the significance (or importance) which that evidence may have in establishing that fact."" (R v Lock (1997) 91 A Crim R 356 at 361 per Hunt CJ at CL;)

48In AW v Regina [2009] NSWCCA 1 Latham J (Bell JA and Fullerton J agreeing) said at [47]:

""47 ... The evidence must have significant probative value, that is, it must be evidence that is meaningful in the context of the issues at trial. The provision is concerned with the qualitative aspects of the evidence, not quantitative ones. ... It must be more than merely relevant, but may be less than substantially so ... The question for the trial judge was whether the evidence was important in establishing the facts in issue ..."" 

49The issue which divided the Court in R v Anna Zhang [2005] NSWCCA 437; 158 A Crim R 504 does not arise in this case because on either test the evidence was admissible. There Simpson J placed emphasis upon the word ""could"" in the definition of ""probative value"" and said:

""139 ... evidence is therefore essentially an evaluative and predictive one. The judge is required, firstly, to determine whether the evidence is capable of rationally affecting the probability of the existence of a fact in issue; secondly (if that determination is affirmative) to evaluate, in the light of any evidence already adduced, and evidence that is anticipated, the likelihood that the jury would assign the evidence significant (in the sense explained by Hunt CJ at CL in Lockyer (1996) 89 A Crim R 457) probative value. If the evaluation results in a conclusion that the jury would be likely to assign the evidence significant probative value, the evidence is admissible.""

50In that case Basten JA (in dissent) identified the question under s97(1)(b) as whether the degree of impact that the tribunal of fact could rationally regard the tendency evidence as having on the probability of the existence of a fact in issue, is ""significant"". At [46] in Zhang Basten JA said:

""[46] ... It is true that the concept of prejudicial effect requires an assessment of the misuse of the evidence which might be made by a jury, comprising people without legal training. On the other hand, I do not think that the assessment of ""probative value"" requires such an exercise. That conclusion follows from the definition of ""probative value"" in the Dictionary to the Act, namely ""the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability"" of a fact. Evidence has significant probative value if it could have such an effect, to a significant extent. The trial judge is not required to second-guess the jury: the judge must make his or her own assessment of probative value for the purposes of s 98.""

51R v Ford [2009] NSWCCA 306; 273 ALR 286 provided guidance as to the meaning of ""prejudicial effect"" as follows:

""56 The unfair prejudice referred to in section 137 is not that the evidence is harmful to the interests of the accused because it tends to establish the Crown case. If that were so, then the more powerful the evidence was in showing the guilt of the accused, the greater would be the difficulty of the Crown in putting the evidence before the jury. Rather, the unfair prejudice referred to in section 137 is harm to the interests of the accused that is unfair because there is a real risk that the evidence will be misused by the jury in some unfair way: R v BD (1997) 94 A Crim R 131 at 139 per Hunt CJ at CL; Papakosmas v The Queen [1999] HCA 37; (1999) 196 CLR 297 at 325 [91] per McHugh J. In R v Suteski [2002] NSWCCA 509; (2002) 56 NSWLR 182 at 199 [116], Wood CJ at CL (with whom Sully and Howie JJ agreed) said that the prejudice referred to in section 137 meant ""damage to the defence case in some unacceptable way, for example by provoking some irrational, emotional or illogical response, or by giving the evidence more weight than it truly deserves"". 

...

58 The same concept, of evidence being prejudicial if it involves a risk of an unfair trial, has been adopted in relation to section 101(2). In R v RN [2005] NSWCCA 413, this Court (Sully J, with whom Grove and Howie JJ agreed) adopted, as expressing the essence of the task called for by section 101(2), the statement by McHugh J in Pfennig v The Queen (1995) 182 CLR 461 at 528-9:

""If there is a real risk that the admission of such evidence may prejudice the fair trial of the criminal charge before the court, the interests of justice require the trial judge to make a value judgment, not a mathematical calculation. The judge must compare the probative strength of the evidence with the degree of risk of an unfair trial if the evidence is admitted. Admitting the evidence will serve the interests of justice only if the judge concludes that the probative force of the evidence compared to the degree of risk of an unfair trial is such that fair minded people would think that the public interest in adducing all relevant evidence of guilt must have priority over the risk of an unfair trial.""""


52The following statements of principle concerning tendency evidence are helpful.

53In R v Alexander Cittadini [2008] NSWCCA 256; 189 A Crim R 492 Simpson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL agreed) said at [22] - [23]:

""22 Proof of a tendency to act in a particular way of itself goes nowhere. Evidence that a person had a particular tendency is adduced in order to render more probable the proposition that, on a particular occasion relevant to the proceedings, that person acted in a particular way (or had a particular state of mind); that is, to provide the foundation for an inference to that effect.

23 Put another way, tendency evidence is tendered to prove (by inference) that, because, on a particular occasion, a person acted in a particular way (or had a particular state of mind), that person, on an occasion relevant to the proceeding, acted in a particular way (or had a particular state of mind).""

54In Regina v Li [2003] NSWCCA 407 Dunford J (Spigelman CJ agreeing) said, at [11]:

""Section 97 is not directed only at evidence showing a tendency to commit a particular crime but showing a tendency ""to act in a particular way"". In this case it was directed to showing that the appellant had a tendency to use violence to the complainant and to seek to control her in stressful marriage situations, and was relevant to whether he did by his actions on the night in question effectively ""detain"" her; but it was necessary for this purpose to show that he had detained her on any other occasion.""

55In R v Fletcher [2005] NSWCCA 338; 156 A Crim R 308 Simpson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL agreed) said at [67]:

""67 In my opinion, the present appellant's argument focused too narrowly upon a tendency to have sexual intercourse in a particular fashion. The DPP's explanation, provided to the appellant's legal advisors, shows that the ""tendency"" which it sought to establish was wider, and more detailed. The DPP sought to establish a pattern of behaviour, or even a modus operandi, in the appellant's behaviour. This included the use of his position as parish priest in meeting Catholic families and involving himself in their lives, developing a special relationship with the families, the children of the families, and in particular with a child the focus of his attention; and the introduction of the child to sexually explicit material and, eventually, inappropriate sexual behaviour.""

56In Ford Campbell JA (Howie and Rothman JJ agreeing) at [38], identified as an error, the judge's apparent view that tendency evidence must itself show a tendency to commit acts that are closely similar to those constituting the particular crime with which the accused is charged. In that case, the accused was charged with sexual intercourse without consent against an 18 year old woman who was a guest in the accused's home. The evidence of two other women he had indecently assaulted while they were guests in his home was held to have significant probative value. The respondent in that case argued that there was nothing unusual about the allegations by the women of sexual interference after a social event involving the consumption of a considerable amount of alcohol. That argument was rejected (Ford at [126]). The lack of a striking pattern or similarity between the charged incident and the other two incidents was held not to be determinative. Campbell JA observed, at [38]:

""38 The second flaw is the judge's apparent view that the tendency evidence must itself show a tendency to commit acts that are closely similar to those that constitute the crime with which a particular accused is charged. That is not so. All that a tendency need be, to fall within the chapeau to section 97(1), is ""a tendency to act in a particular way"". ""

57In relation to tendency in this case, the trial judge said:

""The Crown case against the accused is that he was a Catholic priest who used his position to insinuate himself into the families of girls whom he sexually abused. In each case it is said that he was working in a parish and the girls who were abused were members of families who regarded themselves as Catholic and who regarded visits by him as a priest as welcome visits. In each case it is said that he befriended the parents and as a result would often attend the house, sometimes even staying overnight or for some time.

He then took advantage of his position as a priest to intrude into the private lives of the girls. On some occasions he went into bedrooms and kissed, fondled or touched the girls. With one of the complainants, he invited her to sit on his knee in a confessional and indecently assaulted her while she was there. With another complainant, he lured her into a car and stroked her leg in an indecent way. It is also alleged that on occasions he pressed his penis against the body or leg of a girl and that he went so far as to pull down the pants of a girl on one occasion. What is striking about all of the proposed evidence of the complainants and of CP is his use of his position as a priest to gain access to the girl and then his conduct in molesting them in various ways.

There are differences in each case. For example, it is alleged that he grabbed PR by the throat and was using force to pull down her pants. It is not alleged that he did this to any other complainant. What he is alleged to have done to CP is strikingly similar to what it is alleged he did to MG. LH was much older than the other girls, who were each aged between eight and eleven.

It is also clear (see PWD par [79]) that for the evidence to be admissible under s97, there does not have to be striking similarities or even closely similar behaviour.

Of course, once I have determined as I do that the evidence to be adduced in the case of each complainant is properly tendency evidence in relation to the case of each other complainant and that CP's evidence is properly tendency evidence in relation to each of the complainants, I then have to consider whether the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it might have on the accused (see s101(2)). Probative value is defined in the dictionary to the Evidence Act and clearly what I'm directed to consider is whether the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue. I am required to carry out a balancing task and to identify the type or types of prejudicial effect the evidence may give rise to and why I have reached the view that its probative value substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect.

This is not a case where the Crown seeks to establish an identical behaviour pattern, but rather to establish that by use of his position the accused was able to get access to girls for the purpose of sexually abusing them and that he did so.

In my opinion, the evidence of the complainants and of CP as was said in PWD (par [88]): ""Is capable of rationally affecting the assessment of the probability of the [accused] having engaged in the conduct alleged and having had a sexual interest in doing so.""

I would be giving the jury directions that they could take the tendency evidence into account only if they were satisfied it had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

In my opinion the calling of this evidence would not be likely to deflect the jury from the essential task of considering the evidence against the accused on each count of the indictment. Accordingly, I am unable to find that the introduction of this evidence would be likely to cause any unfair prejudice to the accused and I find that the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it might have on the accused.""

58The Appellant submitted that in respect of each of the complainants and CP, there were substantial differences in the behaviour alleged. The Appellant identified those differences, e.g., in one case the actions involved mainly kissing but in the other, some violence was used. In particular, the Appellant submitted that the conduct alleged against him with respect to PR, was quite different to that alleged with respect to the other complainants.

59The Appellant submitted that in carrying out the balancing exercise, his Honour had failed to properly assess the real prejudice which was likely to arise in a joint trial in which evidence of a variety of sexual forms of offending were alleged to have been committed upon girls of different ages and in a variety of circumstances. Such a procedure was, the Appellant submitted, fundamentally unfair.

60The Appellant submitted that there was a real risk of contamination of the evidence of MG and MM, since they were sisters who, as children, were aware of the allegations in a general sense involving him. They had had an opportunity to discuss such allegations and had exchanged their police witness statements. A similar problem arose with PR, in that her brothers had also made accusations against the Appellant. There was a sibling relationship with some of the tendency witnesses, who provided statements or gave evidence on the voir dire.

61The Appellant relied upon the observation of Hodgson JA (with whom Price and Fullerton JJ agreed) in BP v R; R v BP [2010] NSWCCA 303:

""110 One matter that powerfully affects both the probative value of tendency evidence and the possibility of prejudicial effect is the risk of concoction or contamination of evidence. If the evidence of tendency from different witnesses is reasonably capable of explanation on the basis of concoction, then it will not have the necessary probative value ... However, this will be so only if there is a real chance rather than a merely speculative chance of concoction... The onus is on the Crown to negate the ""real chance"" of concoction ...""

62In relation to his treatment of the tendency evidence, his Honour relied heavily upon what was said in Regina v PWD [2010] NSWCCA 209; 205 A Crim R 75 (Beazley JA, with whom Buddin J and Barr AJ agreed). 

63The statements of principle by his Honour in his judgment were, with respect, correct and relevant. His Honour's summary of the tendency evidence from the complainants and the tendency witnesses was accurate. His Honour acknowledged that there were ""differences in each case"". Despite those differences, his Honour noted that there were significant similarities, particularly as to ""tendency"". His Honour focused upon the consistency of the relevant tendency, not on the factual differences which had existed (which would have been of significance if the evidence was being admitted for coincidence purposes, but which had much less force in the context of evidence to be admitted for tendency purposes).

64The Appellant submitted that the variety and types of offending, and the offending upon different aged girls, constituted the real prejudice that should have led to the evidence being excluded. Such an approach is contrary to authority, i.e. that the evidence does not need to be strikingly or closely similar to be admissible as tendency evidence. If it is not necessary for evidence to be strikingly or closely similar for admissibility under s97, it would be incongruous if the fact that the evidence was not strikingly or closely similar, led to its exclusion under s101. That part of the Appellant's submission has not been made out. 

65The Appellant's reliance upon the observation of Hodgson JA in BP (see [61] hereof) is problematic. In BJS v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 239 at [27] Basten J identified the difficulties with that statement of principle and concluded that it was ""inconsistent with Ellis and should not be applied as a general rule"".

66The Appellant's submissions on the issue of contamination go very close to requiring the trial judge to usurp the function of the jury by making a ruling as to admissibility which went considerably beyond the evaluative process required by ss97 and 101 of the Evidence Act. Moreover, his Honour was well aware of the risk of contamination and he excluded some of the proposed tendency evidence on that basis.

67The evidence of MG and her sister MM, both by way of statement and on the voir dire, taken at its highest from the Appellant's point of view, did no more than establish a merely speculative chance of concoction, rather than a ""real chance"". The evidence of PR when taken with that of her siblings CT, MT and LT, was to the effect that any discussion was limited in its content. Each witness had seen some media reporting of the Appellant being charged before they made their police statements. Such a level of publicity was considered by this Court in BJS v R where Hall J (with whom Basten JA and RS Hulme J agreed) said at [213]:


""213 I do not consider that publicity as to the Appellant's arrest and charging with other sexual offences, of itself, can be taken as having given rise to a risk of contamination. The publicity was limited in its terms. It lacked specificity as to precisely what it was that the Appellant had allegedly done. The fact that the charges related to alleged sexual assault does not in itself suggest there was a real possibility of contamination. ...""

In BJS at [203] the nature of the publicity was analysed in detail and it was this to which reference was made by Hall J at [213].

68The submissions as to contamination and concoction by the Appellant have not been made out.

69Although not specifically referred to in the Grounds of Appeal, submissions were directed to s137 of the Evidence Act in relation to the evidence of the complaints and tendency witnesses. In Regina v Ngatikaura [2006] NSWCCA 161 Simpson J said:

""71 Because of the view I take of the nature of the evidence in question, ss135 and 137 are immaterial. S97 and s101(2) provide the tests for the admission of tendency evidence; in my opinion, they leave no room for the application also of either s135 or s137.""

This statement of principle was implicitly approved in Christian v R [2013] NSWCCA 98 at [59].

70The above considerations are sufficient to deal with Grounds of Appeal 1 and 2. Subject to the resolution of one outstanding matter, I would reject Grounds of Appeal 1 and 2.

71The issue which I have reserved in relation to Grounds of Appeal 1 and 2 is whether the psychological treatment afforded to MG and CP was of such a kind as to attract the exclusionary provisions of ss97 and 101. I have considered that issue in Grounds of Appeal 3 and 5. The outcome of those Grounds of Appeal will determine the outcome of this issue, insofar as it relates to Grounds of Appeal 1 and 2 and other Grounds of Appeal.

Ground of Appeal 3: That the trial miscarried as a result of the trial judge finding that evidence of the complainant MG and witness CP having undergone modalities of treatment such as hypnosis was irrelevant to the issue of those witnesses' reliability and thus his Honour's refusal to exclude the evidence of such witnesses upon the joint trial of each of the counts.

Ground of Appeal 5: That the trial miscarried as a result of the trial judge excluding evidence in the defence case sought to be called from Dr John Albert Roberts and in particular such evidence bearing upon the reliability of witnesses MG and CP.

72It is convenient to deal with these two grounds of appeal together since they essentially raise the same issue.

73The relevant evidence was that of MG, CP, Mr Lyleson, a psychologist; Ms Schaan, a psychologist; Dr Roberts, a psychiatrist and Dr Ellis, a psychiatrist.

74MG prepared three statements concerning the Appellant: 21 October 2008; 1 May 2009 and 6 February 2010. She gave evidence on the voir dire. She attended Mr Lyleson on five occasions in 1999. The reason she saw Mr Lyleson was because of what had happened to her as a result of the conduct of the Appellant. She said that on the first occasion she saw Mr Lyleson, she explained to him what the Appellant had done to her. She also mentioned it on one other occasion.

75When she went to Mr Lyleson to talk about the abuse by the Appellant, she noticed that he did hypnotherapy. As she was trying to give up smoking at the time, she thought that it might help her. She also wanted to build up her confidence. One of the exercises that Mr Lyleson gave her was to place her hands in front and imagine that she was holding her life in her hands. She clearly remembered that occasion but could not remember what else they spoke about at other times. She knew that she underwent some hypnotherapy with him, but this was to do with her confidence. 

76She said that during those sessions when hypnotherapy was applied, there was definitely no discussion about the abuse that she had suffered at the hands of the Appellant.

77Under cross-examination, MG denied that any hypnotherapy had been used when she first attended Mr Lyleson. She agreed that she had undergone hypnotherapy during a later attendance, but that this was to assist her in regaining her confidence. She did not think that she had gone into any detail about the sexual abuse when she spoke to Mr Lyleson. She thought that she had only told him that she had been sexually abused by a priest and then continued to relate that into her life. She said that the type of therapy that she had described with her hands held out parallel, focusing on the energy between her hands, happened only once. When asked how many times she had been hypnotised during the course of her treatment with Mr Lyleson, she answered ""I only remember one, maybe two, times"". She thought that the other session of hypnosis might have related to her smoking.

78She did not remember ever undergoing a mode of therapy where she was asked to relax, to delve into her subconscious mind and to consider things from the past that needed help and to consider abuse that was holding her back. She remembered doing a session where she was asked to do something with moving fingers. She could not say what Mr Lyleson did when she undertook that therapy. She just remembered being surprised that her finger moved.

79Mr Lyleson gave evidence on the voir dire. He did not remember the sessions with MG, apart from his notes. His notes recorded five attendances: 23 April, 3 May, 14 May, 21 May and 26 May 1999. He did remember MG telling him about being touched or molested by a priest. He remembered that in a general sense as a topic.

80After MG mentioned that she had been molested, he thought that she might be somebody who could end up in a court setting. He said that he conducted two sessions of hypnosis with MG. He could not remember for sure, but believed that he might have told MG that the hypnosis session might impact on her presentation as a witness in court. He had a vague recollection of MG saying that she had no interest in taking anything to court.

81There was no note of hypnotism being carried out during the first session on 23 April 1999. During that first session, MG did not say a lot about being sexually abused by a priest. She did not want to go into detail about that. When asked whether the fact of her sexual abuse was an issue that needed to be dealt with in therapy, he said:

""I didn't make up my mind about that one way or the other, and she seemed to be pretty well functioning. Her goals were more about having a better life rather than pulling herself out of a depression or something, so I'd put it certainly as a consideration that it might need attention but she was saying it didn't and I took her word for it.""

He remembered MG saying that it was not something that she needed to go into.

82His memory was that their discussions were not focused at all on MG's sexual abuse as a major part of the therapy. MG said that she was not interested in talking about it and he respected her wishes. He explained that the technique whereby people were asked to close their eyes and hold their hands out parallel in front of their body and to imagine their energy between their hands was known as ""Rossi Hands"". He could not explain the reference to ""Rossi Hands"" at the end of his notes relating to the first consultation. He had no note of what he said or what she said if he had used that technique on that occasion.

83He said that during the second session he put MG into a trance but that it was a light trance. He could not recall, nor did he have any notes of what MG said when she was in that trance. There was no mention of sexual abuse in his notes. He said that he was very careful when it came to sexual abuse to make no suggestions of any kind during therapy.

84On the third session he made a note ""molested by a priest 9"". He did not remember what it was that MG had said about being molested by a priest when aged 9. There was a note that he had given ""homework"" to MG at the end of that session. This could have been journal work or diary work. He did not think that he had asked MG to write down her dreams because that was something which he rarely did. He said that he was very careful with hypnosis not to make any suggestions that could create memories or enhance memories or distort memories. He saw that as a real danger and it was not therapeutic.

85He explained the reference in his notes of 21 May to ""trance to future self"". It meant for MG to do an age progression into a time in the future when a problem was already solved and then generally ""what I do is have the person look back from the future and remember the steps they took to get there"". He said that it included visualising what would seem like past events that were actually future events. He agreed that a person did not always know that they were being hypnotised and that some induction techniques were quite subtle. In his case, however, he always obtained permission from the patient before administering such a technique. He did not know for how long MG was in a trance on 21 May.

86On the last attendance on 26 May Mr Lyleson made a note that read ""Finger signals. Finger middle, yes. Pointer, no"". He explained that this signified another hypnotic technique - ideomotor finger signals. ""It's a process of asking if you have signals from the subconscious mind, the part that can help the client with whatever problem they're having. It requires no talking, so they can just lift a finger, can lift it spontaneously. That would be considered a signal from the subconscious mind"".

87Under that note Mr Lyleson had written ""Things from the past need help. Abuse holding her back. There are resources not being used"". He did not remember if those were notes about what happened during the course of the ideomotor finger signal process but he imagined that they were. He did not believe if finger signals were being used, that anything was said at all by MG. He thought that the words in the notes were his opinions.

88CP gave a statement to the police on 24 October 2008. She did not know any other person who had made a complaint about the Appellant. She underwent counselling with Ms Schaan in 2006. During that counselling, the topic of the Appellant came up. The topic came up in general conversation about other matters. She went to Ms Schaan on a totally unrelated matter and during the course of the discussions, mention of the Appellant occurred. Her reason for seeing Ms Schaan was that she had lost her job of 22 years. Part of her redundancy included counselling for a number of sessions. At the time, she had a physical disability being a problem relating to her shoulder.

89She attended approximately 10 sessions with Ms Schaan. On probably five occasions, the events involved with the Appellant were discussed. She did not receive any form of treatment or have any techniques applied to her in relation to that topic. She was not referred to any written material in relation to that topic.

90Under cross-examination she could not recall whether Ms Schaan taught her breathing techniques and relaxation techniques. She could not recall whether Ms Schaan taught her how to process in her mind issues about anxiety and other emotional difficulties. She could not recall Ms Schaan teaching her a technique which involved her tapping pressure points on her head and saying affirmative things about herself. She said this would have been difficult because her shoulder problem prevented her from lifting her arms to her head. She agreed that her memory of these sessions was not particularly good.

91When asked what she was able to remember about the techniques and methods which Ms Schaan used with her, she said that she recalled techniques relating to pain management. These involved breathing exercises and relaxation exercises, such as taking herself to a nice place like a waterfall while doing those exercises.

92CP did not recall whether Ms Schaan had asked her to write out an account of what happened when she was sexually abused. She did recall an occasion when Ms Schaan suggested that she write a letter to her deceased grandmother. When she wrote that letter, she did not write things about the Appellant in it.

93It was suggested to CP that Ms Schaan had asked her to write an account of the incidents with the Appellant amongst other things and that she did write one out, that she read it to her partner and that her partner became angry and that she told Ms Schaan that that was what had happened. CP agreed that this probably did happen because she recalled writing a letter to her grandmother. She probably did write about the Appellant, but could not recall what she wrote.

94CP agreed that during the course of her sessions with Ms Schaan, there was discussion about how she felt about the topic of the Appellant and what happened to her. She explained to Ms Schaan that she was angry about it and that she felt shame about it. She had difficulty talking about it, even with Ms Schaan. She said that when Ms Schaan gave her homework, she did not always do it. CP was asked whether she remembered any technique that involved moving her eyes. She thought that that happened in Ms Schaan's office, probably on one occasion only. She could not say that this was in the context of dealing with her emotions concerning sexual assault.

95Ms Schaan made statements dated 18 March 2009 and 27 September 2010. She gave evidence on the voir dire and her treatment notes were an exhibit. She had been a registered psychologist since 1994. She came in contact with CP as a result of CP being made redundant by her employer. She saw CP on twelve occasions during 2006. She made notes on the occasions that she saw CP.

96The first consultation on 3 July 2006 was an initial needs assessment as to how she could best assist CP. She did not recall the sessions and had to rely quite a lot on her notes, in order to say what transpired. In the first session, CP talked about constant shoulder pain. Apart from speaking with CP, she did not engage in any psychological techniques or modalities on that occasion.

97The next consultation was 13 July 2006. Her notes for that session referred to ""prefer kinaesthetic relaxation to visual"". She explained this reference:

""One example of kinaesthetic relaxation would be one by one to tense various parts of the body and then relax. A visual relaxation method is when a person is guided through visual images of nature to have the mind focus on pleasant experiences and environments.""

98The next consultation was 27 July 2006. Her notes from that session referred to ""mindfulness technique"". She described this as ""A wide range of different techniques really and it involves helping a person become aware of feelings, to manage them effectively, to diffuse them and to accept them for what they are"". She said that she did not perform any mindfulness techniques during that consultation.

99The next consultation was 10 August. Her notes referred to ""Explained EFT technique for processing emotion"". Ms Schaan explained that EFT is short for Emotional Freedom Technique. It involves tapping meridian points, mainly on the head and face. It is a kinaesthetic emotional diffusion technique"". She believed that she only explained the technique to CP. If she had demonstrated it or practised it, she would have recorded that in her notes. 

100The next consultation was 24 August. Once again, she referred to teaching ""EFT technique"". The next consultation was 31 August. Her notes from that session included:

""Client had difficulty discussing issue. Expressed numbness experiences. Explored what it is like to feel uncomfortable. Discuss sexual interference by brothers' friends, priest."" 

101Ms Schaan said that she understood that the priest was a separate person from the brothers' friend or friends.

102The next consultation was 7 September 2006. Her note of this was:

""Client had written down story of what happened around being molested. She had read it to partner, who was angry. Watched show on TV where perpetrator's side was shown. Explored fears around abuse then/now. Discussed her various siblings to whom this did not happen. Explored the why around parents not protecting. Explored guilt, shame, in relation to parents. Eight year old and fifteen year old child exercise. Empty chair interactive and writing exercise, homework. Explained what to expect in coming weeks: feelings, reactions. Partner's reaction management.""

103The next two consultations occurred on 14 September and 21 September 2006. The notes from the latter consultation included ""Client felt comfortable reading story of two incidents of sexual molestation today. Processed feelings around each ... addressed shame with EFT technique release"". Ms Schaan said that in that session the story that CP had written was read to her but she did not have an independent recollection of what was said.

104Consultations took place on 28 September 2006 and 19 October, with the last consultation on 2 November 2006. Her notes from that last session included: ""Explored feelings about molestation"" and ""Discussed ways of looking at past to integrate experience into identity"". Ms Schaan said that she had never used memory recovery techniques in any of her therapy.

105Under cross-examination Ms Schaan explained the difference between kinaesthetic relaxation and kinergetics. Ms Schaan said that she had never practised kinergetics in relation to any paying patient, including CP. She said that kinaesthetic relaxation was physical relaxation. It did not include trying to create new realities.

106Ms Schaan was asked to explain ""mindfulness techniques"". She did so by saying a mindfulness technique helped people learn how to stop resisting emotion and actually process it and feel it and experience it and accept it as it is. She said that the intention of mindfulness was to remove the story about the feeling and just feel the feeling. She said that there were many mindfulness techniques, and she could not recall the one which she used with CP. She did not agree that a mindfulness technique required a person to focus on the event or the feeling and to understand it and name it to themselves. 

107When talking about the emotional freedom technique, using continuing tapping upon parts of the body, she did not agree that it was undertaken while a specific traumatic memory was focused upon. She agreed that in a typical emotional freedom technique, the person decides what they want to clear from their system, what particular emotion is a trouble to them. She agreed that they are told to focus on that particular emotion. She agreed that the technique involved the use of affirming statements. These statements were normally positive self statements. She agreed that the person was asked to repeat that statement and tap the meridian points on their head. She did not agree that they were asked to stay focused on the issue as they did it. She agreed that people were asked to move their eyes up, down, clockwise and counter-clockwise but had never heard of the technique being used in ways that involved people being asked to hum a song while they moved their eyes in those ways. She said that the self-affirming phase happened at the end of the process where tapping and eye movement were involved. It was not simultaneous. 

108It was suggested to Ms Schaan that the emotional freedom technique used the same fundamental components as systematic desensitisation and distraction techniques. She said that she did not understand what the relationship or comparison was. 

109Ms Schaan said that she was not familiar with EMDR (rapid eye movement desensitisation and reprogramming). She had read a definition of the technique for the purpose of preparing her statement, but she did not know anything at all about it until then. She taught emotional freedom techniques to CP so that CP could use them at home. She gave a hand out about emotional freedom techniques to CP. 

110On 31 August CP had difficulty telling Ms Schaan about the sexual interference. Ms Schaan explored with CP what it was like to feel uncomfortable. Such exploration of what it was like to feel uncomfortable would come under ""mindfulness"". When CP said something to her about sexual interference at the hands of a priest, she made no notes of what was said to have happened. She suggested that CP write down the story of what happened to her. 

111On 7 September, CP came back and there was a discussion about what CP had written. Ms Schaan explained her notes: ""Eight years old and fifteen years old child exercise"". Ms Schaan said ""It's a hypothetical exercise to get a person to think about the cognitive and emotional capacities of a person at a particular age and to ... build understanding about what a person's perspective of the world might be at that age"". Ms Schaan could not recall whether CP told her at what age she was sexually assaulted.

112Ms Schaan said that she would have done the exercise in order to assist CP with her understanding concerning the sexual assault, more than to assist CP with her emotions. Ms Schaan would not call the technique a visualisation technique. Ms Schaan did not agree that the emotional freedom technique used much the same psychological tools as hypnosis. She did not use hypnosis on her clients and she had not been trained in hypnotic technique. She was not able to comment on the proposition that EMDR therapy uses much the same psychological tools as hypnotherapy.

113Ms Schaan was taken to her statement of 27 September 2010 in which she said that cognitive behaviour therapy, mindfulness technique and emotional freedom techniques were all modalities that were scientifically validated psychological treatment methods and that they were endorsed by the Australian Psychological Society. She did not accept the proposition that the Australian Psychological Society did not endorse any techniques. She rejected the proposition that emotional freedom techniques had never been peer reviewed or experimentally assessed.

Letter from Greg Walsh & Co to Dr Roberts, dated 6 October 2010;
Letter from Greg Walsh & Co to Dr Roberts, dated 7 October 2010;

115Dr Roberts was in private practice. He maintained both a clinical and a forensic practice. He had been a psychiatrist since 1974. He had been using hypnosis in a clinical setting since 1974/5. He was a member of the Australian Society for Hypnosis.

116He had used hypnosis primarily in attempts to treat general anxiety disorders, to treat phobic states, to attempt to control excessive weight and as an adjunct to a general program designed to assist people in giving up smoking. He had been asked to do other things, such as hypnosis using age regression for forensic purposes, but he found that unreliable. He said that such exercises were prone to give rise to memories of events that might not have occurred, to distort recollections and to make evidence that a person might give in a forensic sense, potentially unreliable.

117He had given evidence in criminal trials about the impact of hypnosis on a person's state of consciousness and memory on a number of occasions. He had studied academic articles about hypnosis. He had studied textbooks on hypnosis and also looked at articles on the Internet and from journals.

118He described EMDR therapy. He said that it was a treatment that was deemed to be analogous to hypnosis. He said that EMDR had had its vogue and that memories and recollections recovered as a result of EMDR might not be reliable.

119Dr Roberts said that the ""emotional freedom technique"", described by Ms Schaan was without any scientific basis whatsoever. He said that any repetitive stimulus, be it visual, auditory or tactile can be used to induce a hypnotic state. The technique of re-aligning meridians involved a technique that was therefore similar to what could be regarded as hypnosis.

120Dr Roberts was asked what the ""Rossi Hands"" technique was. He said that it was a technique for the induction of hypnosis. It was, however, not a direct technique. He agreed with the description of ""Rossi Hands"" given by Mr Lyleson. 

121Dr Roberts said the point of using ""Rossi Hands"" ought to have been to utilise some aspect of the perception of MG of her inner-self, or subconscious - if one accepts that that exists - to modify behaviour. In relation to hypnosis generally, Dr Roberts said:

""I think that as a general principle if one is doing something beyond just simply getting a person to relax and to minimise anxiety, you would be looking at a level of hypnosis that is somewhat deeper, rather than lighter, but not hypnosis of great depth.""

122He said ""as a general principle, the deeper the level of hypnosis, the greater the level of suggestibility"".

123Dr Roberts was asked to assume that within minutes of being hypnotised in this way, MG had told Mr Lyleson that the reason why she had come to see him was that she had been sexually abused. Dr Roberts responded that this might potentially give rise to memory problems, in particular the creation of new memory. Dr Roberts said that hypnosis might create memories of events that have not occurred, that it might result in a circumstance where suspicions were concreted into certainties and potentially affect the forensic reliability of a person to give evidence in regard to matters of fact. (This factual assumption was never adopted by MG or by Mr Lyleson.)

124Dr Roberts was of the opinion that any hypnosis, regardless of the subject matter, ran the risk of having an impact upon a patient's recollection.

125Dr Roberts said:

""If the patient identified the problem [sexual assault by a priest] as the major source of concern, or a significant source of concern, in my opinion it would be very difficult to envisage that that would not have been impacted upon by the treatment given."" [i.e. hypnosis]

126Dr Roberts agreed that it would depend on how the treatment was given, what was said, how it was said, what her state of consciousness was and ""a whole lot of other things"". He did not know those things because he was not there.

127Dr Roberts said that it could not be said that hypnosis did not alter the recollection of MG because there was no evidence as to what her memory was before the hypnosis session. Although Dr Roberts agreed that there was no evidence as to what was said between MG and Mr Lyleson, he considered that the normal approach would be to use hypnosis to deal with the main reason why the patient was attending, i.e. the sexual assaults.

128Dr Roberts said that the process of age progression or regression involved necessarily suggestions being put by the therapist. He said that ""Ideomotor finger signalling"", which was a finger signalling technique, could be used in the hypnotic state. Because it was disruptive to the induction of the hypnotic state to converse with a patient, the signalling technique is used.

129In relation to Ms Schaan's treatment of CP, Dr Roberts characterised the techniques which she described as ""fringe therapies, fringe philosophies"". He had never used that form of therapy because it had no basis in fact. Dr Roberts said that the description which Ms Schaan gave of a technique involving eye movements was very similar to the technique of EMDR. Its purpose was desensitisation and reprogramming. In this case, he said it would be reprogramming of recollections and emotions associated with an event.

130In relation to Ms Schaan's use of mindfulness techniques, Dr Roberts said that this was similar to meditation and that meditation and hypnosis were virtually identical. It was very difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish between the two. Dr Roberts said that visualising oneself in or going into a beautiful place such as a waterfall, was a very standard hypnotic induction technique. Dr Roberts said that journal writing and writing accounts were utilised as a form of memory recovery technique.

131Dr Roberts said that he did not have any special expertise in relation to children and did not regard himself as a child psychiatrist. Dr Roberts disagreed that in relation to both CP and MG the Court was not dealing with recovered memory. He said that from a psychiatric point of view, he thought the reasonable position was that the psychiatrists did not know what they were dealing with. He agreed that what he was saying was that the therapy conducted by Mr Lyleson had the potential to have altered MG's memory. The risk depended on a number of unknown factors.

132By reference to the report of Dr Ellis, Dr Roberts said:

""I disagree most strongly with Dr Ellis' statement that there is no evidence that suggestion was used. The essence of hypnosis is suggestibility.""

133Dr Roberts said that it was universally agreed that hypnosis was a state of hyper-suggestibility. He said that the only purpose of doing hypnosis was to make suggestions.

134Dr Roberts was asked if he would discount the possibility that, at the end of the initial consultation with Mr Lyleson, there could have been some hypnosis directed at relaxation only. He said that he could not negate the possibility, however, the level of hypnosis undertaken showed a greater depth than one would expect for relaxation. Dr Roberts said that the other area where he disagreed with Dr Ellis was that MG reported a recollection that did not differ before and after the therapy period. He said that, to his knowledge, that had not been established.

135Dr Ellis was a psychiatrist, who gave evidence on the voir dire, and provided a report dated 13 October 2010. Dr Ellis had been provided with a summary of facts relating to MG and CP, their statements and the statements of Mr Lyleson, Ms Schaan and a number of other persons. He had also been provided with the notes taken by Mr Lyleson and Ms Schaan, the transcript of evidence of MG, CP, Mr Lyleson and Ms Schaan and the five reports of Dr Roberts.

136Dr Ellis agreed with the general proposition that hypnosis can influence the experience of memory. He thought the likelihood of distorting memories was greater if the hypnosis was performed over longer periods of time, reinforcing new memories, if suggestion and leading questions were used and if the content of the memories was congruent with the recipient of the hypnosis.

137Dr Ellis said that in this case, there was evidence from witnesses and from MG that the recollection of the allegation was never forgotten and was reported to witnesses before undergoing therapy. The therapy was brief (five sessions) of which parts of three sessions included hypnosis. There was no evidence that suggestion was used, but the contemporaneous notes were brief. The witness reports of her recollection did not differ before and after the therapy period.

138Dr Ellis concluded that there was no evidence that the hypnosis had induced an intrusive recollection, as the recollection was reported before the hypnosis. There was less certainty as to whether the recollection was distorted because the exact recollection pre and post treatment was not recorded in detail. However, there was no evidence of a change of substance in the recollection after hypnosis. Therefore, while hypnosis would have impacted on any recollected memory, the extent of that impact cannot be determined with certainty from the information, other than that a new memory was not intruded during the treatment.

139Dr Ellis noted that hypnosis was a ""diffusely defined concept"". He thought defining treatment by reference to this diffuse boundary, was an exercise in analogy.

140Dr Ellis said:

""Breathing exercises, relaxation techniques involving imagining a calm place, writing a journal or letter of thoughts, feeling and memories, role-playing the point of view of a child are all standard therapeutic techniques that are used in cognitive behavioural therapy. They may share some analogies to early preparation for hypnotic states, but they do not involve alteration in consciousness. They do not, if used correctly, involve suggestion or command. They are not techniques listed in those of concern regarding witness testimony.""

141Under cross-examination Dr Ellis agreed that he had observed hypnotherapy being done but had not performed it. He did not see any evidence that EMDR had been done at all, in either Mr Lyleson's therapy or Ms Schaan's therapy. Dr Ellis said that EMDR would not be considered a hypnotic induction technique but ""like all forms of psychotherapy, shares some similarities with hypnosis in that there is putting someone at ease, relaxing, asking them to talk about memories"".

142Dr Ellis agreed that the ""Rossi Hands"" technique is a form of hypnotic induction. He noted, however, that by the time MG went into the trance to future self, she had already twice raised the topic of being molested by a priest. Dr Ellis said that there were statements that were provided to him of people to whom MG had spoken beforehand so the available evidence suggested that there was a notion that appeared before the therapy and that notion persisted in a similar manner after the therapy, i.e. that she had been assaulted by a priest.

143Dr Ellis said that a point of difference between himself and Dr Roberts was that Dr Roberts included as hypnosis a much broader category of psychological techniques than he did. He did not include things like role-playing with a chair and writing a journal. He did not think that EFT progressed to the level where one would consider it to be hypnosis. Dr Ellis said that the therapists' notes were very scant, but that the intent of the therapies was not to cause the patients to recall recovered memory. One of the reasons that MG went for therapy related to her sexual abuse, but she did not go for the purpose of recalling the memories for the purpose of testimony.

144The trial judge dealt with this issue as follows:

""The only witnesses who gave evidence of hypnotism by psychologists were MG and CP and submissions ultimately about exclusion of evidence related to them.

In my opinion what the evidence revealed was that each complainant spoke of sexual assaults happening when each of them was between 8 and 10 years old. Each of them is now in her early forties.

MG spoke to a psychologist in 1999 and raised sexual assault as a problem to be dealt with along with other problems. She saw Mr Eric Lyleson, a registered psychologist, on a number of occasions in 1999 and on some occasions, he hypnotised her. The sessions were not entered into for any forensic purpose and notes of Mr Lyleson do not contain any details of what MG told him. He made no attempt to assist her to recover a memory. She claimed to remember what happened to her in the sexual assaults before she went to see Mr Lyleson.

There was no evidence that Mr Lyleson sought to entrench any memories. After the last session with Mr Lyleson, MG did not have any further sessions with psychologists. She made her statements to the police after she became aware of the arrest of the accused. She did not know any of the other complainants.

CP went to see Ms Schaan, because she had been retrenched from a job she had held for more than 20 years. Her former employer paid for the counselling, which was given to her to help her cope with the consequences of retrenchment. She had a shoulder problem as a consequence of a failed operation and continuing pain in that shoulder. She had smoking problems and weight problems. She also mentioned that she had been sexually assaulted by a priest. 

During the course of the twelve sessions, techniques were applied from time to time, according to Dr Roberts [see later] that were either hypnosis or something similar to hypnosis. Ms Schaan did not seek to help her to recover a memory. Ms Schaan denied that she hypnotised CP and gave evidence that she had no training in hypnosis. CP claimed to have a memory of what sexual abuse happened. According to her, that memory did not change. None of the sessions were conducted for any forensic purpose and there is no evidence that the sessions influenced the evidence she intends to give in any way. The hypnosis sessions helped her to feel better about herself.

She made her statements to the police after she became aware of the arrest of the accused. She did not know any of the other complainants. Dr Roberts provided a number of reports and gave evidence. The Crown objected to the reports and the evidence claiming that it was irrelevant, however, I allowed the reports to be tendered on the voir dire and allowed him to give evidence, because I wanted to determine if the reports or the evidence were relevant for the trial.

In essence his evidence was that there was a risk that a false memory may be created or entrenched by any hypnotism, even if it were not directed to sexual assault. It was possible, according to Dr Roberts, for a memory to be created or a false memory entrenched even if the hypnotism was not directed to any forensic purpose.

It is clear that the treatments of MG and CP were not part of a forensic exercise of ""recovering memory"". Mr Lyleson specifically denied that he attempted any such thing. Ms Schaan claimed that she did not hypnotise CP at any time, but some of her techniques may have been similar to the induction phase of hypnotism. Dr Roberts disclaimed any pretence to be someone who was a child psychiatrist.

I have carefully considered the evidence of Dr Roberts, but I do not find it convincing. What he raises in his evidence, in my opinion, is the bare possibility, for reasons which are not satisfactorily explained, that the psychologists may have in some way affected the memory of their patients about sexual abuse, even though they did not raise specific questions about this and they did not seek to entrench or create any memory at all. According to Dr Roberts the entrenching or creating of memory could occur in circumstances where the subject of sexual abuse was not being discussed but where hypnosis or hypnosis like therapy was being applied during which other matters were discussed. I found it extremely difficult to follow, just as I found it difficult to accept his evidence that a person engaging in meditation was in fact doing something very similar to hypnosis. 

What occurred in these cases was quite different from cases where police officers have specifically arranged for witnesses to be hypnotised with a view to obtaining evidence from them. Neither of the psychologists who have given evidence before me were attempting in any way to get their patients to remember anything for the purposes of some form of litigation.

I can see nothing to throw any doubts on the reliability of CP or MG and I can see no circumstances for excluding the evidence of either of them. 

Of course in determining whether I should exclude this evidence I have regard to the provisions of section 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 and to the recent decision of R v JG (Court of Criminal Appeal, unreported). This decision confirms the application of section 137 in determining the question whether evidence of a complainant who has been hypnotised should be admitted in evidence or whether such evidence should be excluded.

Unlike the case of JG, MG and CP were not the subject of hypnosis for forensic purposes. 

MG was hypnotised four times by a psychologist who was treating her for difficulties in her life. He did not seek to get any details of the sexual abuse, did not make any suggestions about it, did nothing to entrench any memories she may have had, but did on at least one occasion ask her during hypnosis to deal with her feelings. She claimed her memory before the hypnosis and after it remained the same. Dr Roberts was of the opinion that she may have been mistaken and her memory afterwards may have been different than it was before hypnosis. I can see nothing that would lead me to conclude that she should not be permitted to give evidence of that memory. CP was not hypnotised, according to Ms Schaan. CP also denied that this occurred. I can see no proper basis for excluding her evidence."" 

145The Appellant submitted that his Honour had not properly applied s137 of the Evidence Act to the evidence of MG and CP in that he had not taken into account the effect of hypnosis on the probative value of their evidence. The Appellant relied upon the general statements of principle by Dr Roberts to the effect that the administration of hypnosis as a therapy, even when not directed to towards specific memories, and when not seeking to modify memory, would inevitably have an effect on the reliability of a witness' recollection.

146The Appellant referred to the admission by Mr Lyleson that he had used hypnosis on at least two occasions when treating MG and perhaps three. The Appellant referred to the ""Rossi Hands"" technique and the ideomotor responses which suggested a deeper level of hypnosis. The Appellant submitted that in line with the opinion of Dr Roberts, the very process of hypnosis itself was capable of creating memories about events that may not have existed and distorting recollections, even though hypnosis may not have been directed to treating those memories. This was particularly so when MG saw Mr Lyleson for the specific purpose of dealing with the effect on her of sexual abuse by the Appellant.

147The Appellant submitted that when those matters were taken into account, the probative value of the evidence of MG was seriously reduced, so as to not satisfy the balancing test required by s137.

148In relation to CP, the Appellant relied upon the evidence of Ms Schaan when describing the various techniques used. He submitted that when that evidence was taken with that of Dr Roberts, it became clear that Ms Schaan was engaging in hypnotic techniques, even though she did not acknowledge that fact. That being so, the same qualifications as to the reliability of her evidence, applied as in the case of MG. Accordingly, the requirements of s137 had not been made out and her evidence should be rejected.

149The difficulty for the Appellant in those submissions is that they depend very heavily upon the evidence of Dr Roberts being accepted. With some justification, the trial judge was critical of the evidence of Dr Roberts. While that issue is more appropriately discussed in relation to Ground of Appeal 5, it needs to be kept in mind when considering Ground of Appeal 3.

150In the case of CP, Dr Roberts' evidence assumed that hypnotic techniques were used, despite the specific denials to that effect by both CP and Ms Schaan. As the trial judge appreciated, it was speculative on the part of Dr Roberts to assert that because certain techniques described by Ms Schaan ""could"" be associated with hypnosis, that this was so. There was no evidence any hypnosis was used in the treatment of CP by Ms Schaan. I have concluded that the trial judge did not err in rejecting the evidence of Dr Roberts insofar as it sought to challenge the probative value of the evidence of CP.

151Another difficulty for the Appellant in maintaining this ground of appeal is that in the case of both MG and CP, evidence as to the sexual assaults by the Appellant on them had been related by them to other persons well before they received any psychological treatment.

152It is true, as Dr Roberts stated, that they had not made statements and had not in terms set out clearly the precise nature of the allegations. It is, however, clear that the broad thrust of the allegations had been communicated to others. There was no evidence that any suggestions had been made to either CP or MG by the psychologists in relation to these issues, nor was there any attempt to enhance or recover any memory. There was no evidence that the recollection of either witness was in any way impacted by the treatment which they received.

153On this issue the comment by Brooking JA (with whom Tadgell and Buchanan JJA agreed) in The Queen v JMS [1998] VSCA 19 is of assistance:

""22 In a case in which there was no evidence whatever of what the counsellor had said to the complainant - for all the jury knew, there might have been nothing remotely resembling ""therapy"" and nothing more than the giving of one or two pieces of practical advice - it would have been quite mischievous and misleading for the jury to hear testimony from an expert which might well have suggested to a lay person that on the evidence the complainant had received therapy which had tended to alter her memory.""

154In relation to the submission that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to cross-examine MG and CP because their recollections had been influenced by the therapy undertaken, the observations by Basten JA in Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v J G [2010] NSWCCA 222 are applicable. That was a case which raised similar issues in relation to the possibility of contamination of memory by the use of hypnosis. Basten JA said: 

""129 His Honour commenced this part of his reasons, with proposition (b), at [190], that the ordinary juror is unlikely to know about the effects of hypnosis upon the human memory. He might have added, in accordance with the expert evidence before him, that psychologists and psychiatrists had the limited advantage of knowledge of ignorance. There was evidence that hypnosis ""may increase the confidence of recall of events that may be believed to have happened"" (see report of Dr Roberts, p 7) but no expert evidence suggested that there was any scientific explanation of how that occurred, or the extent to which it occurred in specific cases. Once elements of hyperbole are removed (for example, the comment by Dr Roberts as to ""the liability of hypnotic intervention ... to create forensic havoc"") it is clear that little can be said with precision as to even the possible effects of the two hypnosis sessions on the daughter's memory. As noted above, there is no evidence of any significant additional detail being elicited in the course of those sessions, beyond that contained in the lengthy interviews conducted before the hypnosis.

...

131 The possibility that the two sessions of hypnosis have increased the confidence of the daughter in the memories earlier recorded must be acknowledged. However, the evidence did not support giving that factor significant weight. ...""

155RS Hulme J in JG made similar observations:

""165 Dr Roberts and the author whom Dr Roberts quoted, did not attempt to quantify the factors mentioned but it is not difficult to conceive of circumstances where they might substantially impede the chances of a successful cross-examination. On the other hand it is not only hypnosis that can impede or reduce the chances of a successful cross-examination. The death of someone whose representations can be proved by others, say in the circumstances contemplated by section 65 of the Evidence Act, can have such an effect. So can serious mental deterioration, simply forgetting or more serious loss of memory, or even irremediable absence of a witness. 

166 Furthermore, the fact problems may arise in some circumstances provides no adequate basis for concluding they must arise, either in all cases or in a particular case where hypnosis has been used ...""

156The conventional application of s137 of the Evidence Act, as interpreted by cases such as R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112 would allow the evidence of MG and CP to be adduced, given its high probative value if it were accepted by the jury. In this case, however, his Honour not only looked at the probative value of the evidence and balanced that against its prejudicial effect, the trial judge went further and made an assessment of the reliability of the evidence, a step which on one view of s137 he should not have taken but which could only favour the Appellant.

157The approach to s137 of the Evidence Act in New South Wales was summarised by Basten JA in JG as follows:

""71 ... Further, this Court has construed s137 as requiring attention to the capability of the evidence to have a particular effect, rather than its reliability, which is a matter for the jury.

72 The approach to be adopted under s137, in assessing the probative value of the evidence is to inquire whether, if accepted by the jury, it ""could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue"": Dictionary, probative value. That assessment involves an objective test of the capability of the evidence to support an inference, rather than assessment of what the jury is likely to conclude: R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112 at [61], Spigelman CJ, Simpson and Adams JJ agreeing. As the Chief Justice stated at [64]:

""To adopt any other approach would be to usurp for a trial judge critical aspects of the traditional role of a jury. In the case of evidence of critical significance, such a ruling by a trial judge would, in substance, be equivalent to directing a verdict of acquittal on the basis that the trial judge was of the view that a verdict of guilty would be unsafe and unsatisfactory. As the High Court said in that different but not irrelevant context in Doney v The Queen [1990] HCA 51; 171 CLR 207 at 275, this is not a permissible ""basis for enlarging the powers of a trial judge at the expense of the traditional jury function"". In my opinion, the same is true if a trial judge can determine the weight of evidence when applying s137.""

73 The judgment in Doney approved the approach taken by this Court in R v R (1989) 18 NSWLR 74 in which Gleeson CJ (Maxwell and Wood JJ agreeing) rejected the proposition that, where there was some evidence, capable of supporting a conviction, a trial judge could direct an acquittal because, on his or her own assessment of the evidence, a verdict of guilty would be unsafe and unsatisfactory. Although the assessment of the evidence as a whole is undoubtedly a different function from assessing individual pieces of evidence, nevertheless, absent statutory authority, it is doubtful whether, consistently with principle, the trial judge should be entitled to assess ""safety"" in relation to the latter, but not the former. The power of the trial judge, in determining relevance, must be to assess the capability of the evidence, if accepted by the jury, of affecting the assessment of a fact in issue. If it could rationally affect that assessment, there may no doubt be circumstances where the affectation is either irrational or cannot be rationally assessed. That appears to have been the factor which weighed upon his Honour's mind in the present case. However, it is a mere matter of semantics to say that the latter concerns are not properly described as involving a ""danger of unfair prejudice"" to the respondent. If that is accepted, then the role of the trial judge is identified by the terms of s137 and any alternative approach would be inconsistent with the requirements of that provision.

74 It was acknowledged in Shamouil, in circumstances which were not identified with any precision, that questions of credibility or reliability could not be categorically excluded in all circumstances: (at [56] and [63], referring to R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52 at [53] (Simpson J)). The primary judge was conscious of that principle: The question was whether it operated in the present circumstances and, if so, in what manner.

75 It follows that, in my view, Buddin J was in error in applying the so called McFelin principles for two reasons: First, there was no authority binding his Honour, either of a single judge or an Australian appellate court, which required that he be affirmatively satisfied of the safety of admitting the evidence which was not the product of hypnosis. Secondly, that test, even if applicable under the general law, cannot stand with the requirements of the Evidence Act which provides otherwise.""

158It follows that Ground of Appeal 3 has not been made out. His Honour did not err in admitting the evidence of MG and CP.

159The Appellant submitted that the evidence of Dr Roberts should have been admitted because the jury might give the evidence of CP and MG undue weight. This was because an ordinary juror would be unlikely to know about the effects of hypnosis upon human memory. It was therefore important that the jury have before it the evidence of Dr Roberts concerning the possible risk that the recollections of JG and CP had been altered by the therapies used by the psychologists who provided treatment to them.

160I have already indicated why the evidence of Dr Roberts is irrelevant to the admissibility under s137 of the evidence of CP. Accordingly, its admissibility needs to be considered only in relation to the evidence of MG.

161The Appellant submitted that the evidence of Dr Roberts was relevant and therefore admissible because it was directed to the reliability of the evidence of MG in that she had undergone treatment by hypnosis on approximately three occasions, at the hands of Mr Lyleson and that as a result, there was a risk that her memory concerning him had become distorted. The opinion of Dr Roberts on those issues was based on his ""specialised knowledge"" as a psychiatrist and on learned articles to which he referred. The effect of the evidence of Dr Roberts has already been set out. The Appellant relied upon such cases as Farrell v R [1998] HCA 50; 194 CLR 286 to the effect that expert evidence concerning a medical condition which may affect a witness' ability to give reliable evidence is admissible, provided the expert evidence extends beyond the experience of ordinary persons.

162One of the reasons for the trial judge rejecting the evidence of Dr Roberts was that he found it unconvincing. His Honour was of the opinion that at most it raised the ""bare possibility"" that the memory of MG had been adversely affected. On that basis, his Honour was entitled to reject the evidence under s108C of the Evidence Act because his evidence could not ""substantially affect the assessment of the credibility"" of MG.

163There is another basis on which the evidence of Dr Roberts should have been rejected. As in JG, Dr Roberts was not able to explain how hypnosis might adversely affect a witness's memory where the hypnosis was not directed in any way towards that memory or a subject matter connected in some way to the memory. This is particularly the case with MG where Mr Lyleson was very careful to make no suggestions to her when providing this treatment. His Honour was entitled to be sceptical of Dr Roberts equating meditation with hypnosis, or something very similar to it.

164Large parts of the evidence of Dr Roberts, both orally and in his reports, did not set out the factual basis for the conclusions which he reached. Many of those conclusions were based on assumptions which were not supported by the evidence. In some cases, the conclusions were little more than ipse dixit statements.

165In view of the evidence of MG, CP, Mr Lyleson and Ms Schaan, which was all one way, and which was to the effect that no attempt had been made to reconstruct or modify any memory of past events, let alone the sexual assaults, the introduction of the evidence of Dr Roberts with the deficiencies to which I have referred, would have run the risk of significantly distracting the jury from its essential task of assessing the evidence. The potential for false issues to be raised by that evidence was real and significant. 

166It follows that Ground of Appeal 5 has not been made out and that his Honour did not err in rejecting the evidence of Dr Roberts.

Ground of Appeal 4: That the trial miscarried as a result of the trial judge upholding objection pursuant to the provision of the Criminal Procedure Act 1997 (sexual assault communications privilege) so as to prevent the defendant being permitted to cross-examine CP and MG about the content of the counselling sessions upon the trial of the Appellant.

167This Ground of Appeal relates to the matters covered by Grounds of Appeal 3 and 5. As indicated, the primary judge directed that the counselling notes should be produced and their content has been set out above. 

168The provisions of s298 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1987 have since been amended but at the time relevantly provided:

""298(4) The court must not give leave to adduce evidence that discloses a protected confidence or the contents of a document recording a protected confidence unless the court is satisfied that:

(a) The evidence will either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have substantial probative value, and

(b) Other evidence of the protected confidence or the contents of the document recording the protected confidence is not available, and

(c) The public interest in preserving the confidentiality of protected confidences and protecting the principal protected confider from harm is substantially outweighed by the public interest in admitting into evidence information or the contents of a document of substantial probative value.

(5) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account and the purposes of subsection (4)(c), the court must take into account the likelihood, and the nature or extent, of harm that would be caused to the principal protected confider if the evidence that discloses the protected confidence or the contents of the document recording the protected confidence is adduced.""

169There was no issue that the communications between MG and Mr Lyleson were protected confidences and that they fell within the sexual assault communication privilege provisions (ss 295 - 300 of the Act). The legislation did not apply to CP as the definition of ""sexual assault offence"" in s295 at that time did not encompass offences in other jurisdictions.

170His Honour's reasons on this issue were:

""What is clearly intended by these provisions is that confidential communications revealing instances of sexual assault should not be made the subject of evidence in the trial unless the trial judge, applying the appropriate tests comes to the conclusion that this evidence should be given. In particular, the court must have regard to the following words (his Honour then set out the provisions of ss 298(4)).

...

These words mean, in my opinion, that I must not, once I am satisfied there is a protected confidence involved, give leave to adduce evidence, unless I am satisfied of three matters:

1. The evidence will have substantial probative value and

2. Other evidence of the protected confidence or of the contents of the documents recording the protected confidence is not available, and

3. The public interest in preserving the confidentiality of protected confidences and protecting the principal protected confider from harm is substantially outweighed by the public interest in admitting into evidence information or the contents of the document because it is of substantial probative value.

In my opinion, the notes of Mr Lyleson contain confidential communications which within the meaning of these sections are protected confidences. The evidence which MG can give concerning the counselling sessions would reveal those protected confidences. 

For the purpose of determining what I should do I have already heard the evidence of each of them on the voir dire and I'm able to come to the opinion that MG would not be likely to suffer any harm of any kind as a result of the adducing of evidence about the psychological counselling sessions.

However I am unable to form any opinion that the evidence that MG and Mr Lyleson could give about these documents and these sessions would be of substantial probative value in the trial.

In my opinion all of the evidence about these counselling sessions reveals nothing more than that MG was unhappy with life many years after the alleged episodes of sexual abuse and sought psychological counselling to assist with the problem. In the course of that counselling, she revealed that she had been sexually abused at a much earlier stage of life. No detail was gone into by the psychologist and in my opinion, there is no evidence of a satisfactory nature that causes me to think that the evidence of MG was affected adversely by the psychological counselling. The mere fact that she was hypnotised and was made the subject of some techniques which are similar to hypnotism in my opinion does nothing to detract from the evidence which she is going to give. At its highest, the evidence of Dr Roberts raises a bare possibility that her memories of events may have been enhanced or entrenched but that possibility does not, in my opinion, mean that the evidence has substantial probative value. It would also be irrelevant, in my opinion, for the evidence of Dr Roberts or any other psychiatrist to be called about the psychological counselling sessions.

In my opinion the evidence would not be of substantial probative value and it should not be admitted. Furthermore, in my opinion, admitting this evidence will distract the jury from the task that is before them, namely whether the accused committed all or any of the acts alleged against him.

In the case of CP, in my opinion, there is evidence to establish that she was not hypnotised and the bare possibility that techniques were applied, which may have had some similarity to hypnosis, does not change this position. Any examination of the psychological counselling sessions would be irrelevant.

But the evidence of these complainants also has features common to that of the other complainants, i.e.

The accused gained access to their families using his position as a priest to do so.

He frequently visited the family home and at least one parent was very pleased to receive him.

He used his position as a priest to get access to the complainants who were each of them school girls.

He sexually abused each of them although some of the abuse was not at home but in a confessional or in a car.

Mr Boulten submitted that the trial would miscarry if I did not permit the examination and cross-examination of CP and MG concerning their psychological counselling sessions and if I did not permit the examination and cross-examination of Mr Lyleson and Ms Schaan as well as the calling of Dr Roberts.

He contended that the only two witnesses who were hypnotised were CP and MG and to allow their evidence to be given in the trial as tendency evidence in relation to each of the other complainants would be to create an unfair prejudice to the accused because he would not be able to cross-examine them about the fact that they had been hypnotised and would not be able to suggest to them that because of that hypnotism their memories of what occurred were affected.

I do not agree with these submissions. In my opinion there is no evidence to suggest that either of these witnesses has a false or entrenched memory as a result of hypnotism. Indeed, what each of them says occurred as I have said earlier, has similarities with what each of the other complainant has said happened to her. CP and MG both claim that their memory of what occurred did not change because of the psychological counselling sessions. I cannot accept and do not accept that the evidence that could be given by Mr Lyleson, Mr Schaan or Dr Roberts could do anything more than raise a bare possibility that their memories may have been affected in some way.

It follows that I will not permit the documents which show notes of the conferences to be tendered in evidence. I will not permit CP or MG to be examined or cross-examined about the documents or the counselling sessions and I will not permit Dr Roberts the psychologist or any other psychiatrist to be examined or cross-examined about the counselling sessions.""

171From the contents of the notes which have been summarised above, for the reasons given by his Honour and for the reasons set out for rejecting Grounds of Appeal 3 and 5, his Honour's conclusion on this issue was undoubtedly correct. The probative value of the counselling notes was of a very low order and could not be characterised as having ""substantial probative value"". On the contrary, as his Honour found, in relation to CP they were irrelevant. Accordingly, even though his Honour incorrectly found that CP was covered by the legislation, the proposed evidence and cross-examination of her was correctly rejected because they were irrelevant.

172No error in his Honour's conclusion has been established. This Ground of Appeal has not been made out.

Ground of Appeal 6: That the trial miscarried as a result of his Honour refusing to discharge the jury in circumstances where the Crown was permitted to adduce evidence of the psychiatric history of witness ""Y"" despite his Honour earlier ruling that such evidence was not relevant to the issues to be tried. (The reference in this Ground of Appeal to ""Y"" is a reference to CP.)

173This ground of appeal is based on evidence given by CP in answer to questions put by the prosecution in re-examination:

""Q. I forgot to ask you this but after [BJS] left and you stopped contact with him did you continue at school that year or what was the situation?
A. I'm not sure of the timeframe but as - 

BOULTEN: Well I object to this.

HIS HONOUR: Why?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: I press it.

HIS HONOUR: I allow it, yes go on.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. Yes you can continue.
A. Again, I'm not sure of the timeframe, but after the event I suffered a sort of breakdown and ended up with an entire term off school. And I believe as a result of this incident.

Q. Was it Xxxxxxx College where you missed the time?
A. Yes it was.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, that's all. Thank you your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Do you have any cross-examination?

BOULTEN: There's a matter of law I wish to raise with your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: All right. Just go outside for a minute members of the jury can we cut the witness off please."" (T.859)

174Senior counsel for the Appellant explained his objection as follows:

The evidence whether the witness was psychologically damaged was irrelevant, and she was not an expert.

The evidence would make relevant the witness's psychological profile at that time. This would require the admission of all of the evidence as to her psychological condition, including the consultations with Ms Schaan.

175His Honour responded to the objection as follows:

""HIS HONOUR: Well I don't agree with you. I don't think it's got anything to do with Jordan Schaan. That occurred many years later. I'm not going to go over all the reasons I gave you then for saying it's irrelevant, because it's still irrelevant. But she's given a view about how she felt after the event and how it affected her. That's all she's saying.

BOULTEN: She said that she had a psychiatric breakdown and she knows why it was.

HIS HONOUR: She thought she did.

BOULTEN: Yes. No she said she did.

HIS HONOUR: I can tell the jury that's a matter of her view, that's how she feels; it's not a matter of expertise or anything of the kind."" (T.861)

176In further exchanges with counsel, his Honour refused to allow any questions to be addressed to the attendance by CP on Ms Schaan. He did allow senior counsel for the Appellant to ask questions about CP's state of mind at the time of the assaults. CP was cross-examined about the evidence which she had given about having had a breakdown and about the stresses in her life in 1983 and 1984. Evidence was elicited about her mother's psychiatric problems and the state of her parents' marriage. In that cross-examination CP agreed that she had sought treatment over the years for ""emotional difficulties"" and that it was more than six months after the offending before she took time off from school.

177At trial, senior counsel for the Appellant sought a discharge of the jury on the basis of the wrongful admission of this evidence. That application was refused by the trial judge but a copy of his Honour's reasons is not available.

178On appeal, the Appellant submitted that the evidence should not have been admitted because it was not relevant to a fact in issue (s55(2) Evidence Act 1995) and because CP lacked the expertise to express the opinion which she did. The Appellant submitted that the jury should have been discharged because of the prejudice created by the question and answer. This was because they invited the jury to speculate that firstly, the witness had suffered a psychological breakdown and secondly, that the breakdown had occurred as a result of being sexually assaulted by the Appellant. The Appellant submitted that allowing senior counsel to cross-examine CP in relation to the evidence had only increased the prejudice.

179A proper examination of the question makes it clear that CP was not being asked for her opinion as to why she took time off from school. The question sought to establish that soon after the incident with the Appellant, she became sufficiently unwell to prevent her attending school. Accordingly, that part of the answer which expressed her belief was non responsive.

180I agree, however, that the relevance of the question, limited as it was, was problematic. That having been said, in the context of this trial the prejudice, if any, created by the answer was minimal. It did not provide a basis for the discharge of the jury. The decision to further cross-examine on the issue was a forensic one made by experienced senior counsel at trial. The evidence was so peripheral that there was no need for him to do so. Nevertheless, the cross-examination was effective in not only identifying other causes for why CP may have been away from school, but in also establishing a significant temporal gap between the assaults and when she took time away from school.

181In the event the evidence was put to good effect by the defence and formed the basis for ""worrying point 7"" and ""worrying point 8"" in the defence submissions at the conclusion of the trial. The evidence was selected to highlight two discrete points. The evidence was said to provide a basis for suggesting that the witness had problems that were unrelated to the Appellant and that over the years she had sought out psychologists or psychiatrists (T.1262).

182This ground of appeal has not been made out.

Ground of Appeal 7: That the trial miscarried as a result of the trial judge's ruling that the Crown Prosecutor be permitted to cross-examine the accused.

Ground of Appeal 8: That the trial miscarried as a result of the trial judge's refusal to discharge the jury consequent upon permitting the Crown Prosecutor to cross-examine the accused as to tendency.

183The background to these grounds of appeal were questions put by the Crown to the Appellant at T.958-959. The questions were:

""Q. The first proposition is this, I put to you squarely that from about 1976 until at least 1983 you had a sexual interest in young girls and young women, correct? [emphasis added]
A. No, not correct.

Q. Further, that you used your office as a respected Catholic priest and at times family confidante, to gain access to young girls and young women, that's correct isn't it? [emphasis added]
A. No, it's not correct.

Q. And further, this is the third proposition that I put to you, that having gained that opportunity you then acted on that sexual interest and you indecently assaulted the young girls and young women for whom you had gained such access, correct? [emphasis added]
A. No, not correct.""

184The Crown asked the following question:

""Q. Do you say that you acted in an open manner towards these people and they've come along to court and told something which didn't happen?""

Objection was taken to that question by the defence. 

185The basis for the objection was firstly, that the question called on the Appellant to explain what was in the mind of the witnesses who had come along to give evidence and secondly, it invited the Appellant to comment on the motivation of those witnesses to come forward. After discussion, the trial judge overruled the objection and allowed the questions to continue. The questions continued at T.962.

""Q. What I was just putting to you before, a moment ago, was this, am I right in understanding that you are saying that you only ever acted towards these people in an open way within the terms of your office and yet they're coming along?
A. Yes.""

The Crown then put to the Appellant the evidence of PR and members of her family to the effect that he had stayed in her home on three occasions.

186It was against this background that the following questions were asked of the Appellant at T.963:

""Q. And you say that's wrong do you?
A. Yes.

Q. And you say it's wrong because you never stayed there?
A. I never stayed in the house.

Q. You can't be mistaken about that?
A. No.

Q. You heard MT saying that you stayed in the house?
A. Yeah, I heard him say that.

Q. He's wrong is he?
A. Yes.

Q. No mistake?
A. No mistake.

Q. As far you're concerned?
A. No mistake.

Q. And WT, the mother, said you stayed on a number of occasions do you recall that evidence?
A. Yeah I remember that evidence.

Q. And she's mistaken as well?
A. Yeah.""

187Senior counsel for the Appellant made an application that the jury be discharged. The basis for the application was the series of propositions that between 1976 and 1981 he had had a sexual interest in young girls and young women, and that he had used his position as a Catholic priest to gain access to young girls and young women and that he had indecently assaulted the young girls and a young woman ""for whom you had gained such access"". Senior counsel for the Appellant submitted that the phrase ""young girls and young women"" went beyond the tendency that was advanced in support of the evidence that was admitted as tendency evidence. He submitted that the tendency relied upon by the Crown was a tendency to act in particular ways in relation to girls, aged between 7 - 17 years. ""Young women"" could include persons older than 17. Senior counsel for the Appellant submitted that the questions allowed the inference that the Appellant had indecently assaulted other young girls and young women beyond those who had given evidence in the proceedings. His Honour refused to discharge the jury on that basis.

188His Honour was correct in refusing to discharge the jury on the basis put forward on behalf of the Appellant. In relation to the questions put concerning ""young girls and young women"", it was clear from those questions that the period concerned was 1976 - 1981, which correlated with the period stipulated in the counts on the indictment and in the tendency notice. The oldest of the complainants was 17. It was, in the circumstances, entirely appropriate to categorise that complainant as ""a young woman"". It was also clear that the questions were confined to those persons called at trial and did not extend to any broader group.

189The submission by senior counsel for the Appellant has an air of unreality about it. Witnesses had given evidence who clearly came within the description of ""young girls and young women"". There was no suggestion in any of the evidence that other unspecified young girls and young women had been the objects of sexual interest by the Appellant. The context in which the questions were put made it clear that they were directed to the witnesses who had given evidence at trial.

190If there were any doubt on that issue, it was resolved by the trial judge when at T.987, following the discussion with counsel, he gave further specific directions to the jury. His Honour reminded the jury of the questions which had been put to the Appellant and directed the jury that the ""young girls and young women"", to which reference was made, were restricted to those persons specifically mentioned in the trial and not to any other group. The trial judge directed the jury not to assume that the questions related to any conduct beyond that raised in the proceedings. His Honour directed the jury not to speculate that the Appellant had roamed around doing anything else to anyone else.

191The second basis for the application to discharge the jury arose from those questions which referred, in general terms to witnesses ""coming along"" to give evidence or being mistaken in the evidence which they gave. Senior counsel for the Appellant submitted that these questions were impermissible because the Appellant was being asked questions about whether a complainant, or other witness, had a motive to lie. 

192The Appellant relied upon the observation in Palmer v R [1998] HCA 2; 193 CLR 1 (Brennan CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ) at [8]:

""8 If it were permissible generally to cross-examine an accused to show that he has no knowledge of any fact from which to infer that the complainant has a motive to lie, the cross-examination would focus the jury's attention on irrelevancies, especially when the case is ""oath against oath"". In such a case, to ask an accused the question: ""Why would the complainant lie?"" is to invite the jury to accept the complainant's evidence unless some positive answer to that question is given by the accused. As Gleeson CJ, speaking for the Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales, said in F:

""the 'central theme' of the case, according to the trial judge, could be found in the question, 'Why would the complainant lie'? That is a question, often left unspoken, which usually hovers over cases of this nature. ... Whilst that question, sometimes spoken, sometimes unspoken, is often of great practical importance, it is never 'the central theme' of a criminal trial. At a criminal trial the critical question is whether the Crown has proved the guilt of the accused person beyond reasonable doubt. Just as the law does not require the Crown to prove a motive for the criminal conduct of the accused, the law does not require the accused to prove a motive for the making of false accusations by a complainant.""""

193The submission of the Appellant is not made out. The question objected to, and which formed the basis for the application to discharge the jury (T.962.5), fell well short of asking the Appellant to explain or speculate on why witnesses had given evidence. The question at [169] hereof did not give rise to the problem identified in Palmer. In Palmer the questioning imposed an onus on the accused, which was impermissible. That was not the situation here.

194There was nothing objectionable about the subsequent questions. The Appellant was asked about the complainant, PR, her brother and mother. He was asked if each was wrong in saying that he had stayed in their home. He was asked if he could be mistaken in his evidence. He was asked whether the mother was mistaken in her evidence (T.963.50 - 964.46). What he was not asked was whether the evidence of those witnesses was false due to ""invention, malice, mistake or other cause"" (R v Leak (1969) SASR 172.

195The Appellant was not asked why a witness gave particular evidence. He was asked if particular evidence was wrong. He was asked one question about whether a witness was mistaken. It is clear from the sequence of questions that this question followed on from the questioning as to whether a witness was wrong. The question was clearly being asked to suggest error, rather than invite an opinion as to the basis for the contradictory evidence. None of the questions asked the Appellant why it was that a witness had given evidence wrong or otherwise.

196In the course of the summing up, senior counsel for the Appellant asked his Honour to specifically direct the jury on the subject of motive to lie. He provided his Honour with a document relevant to that direction. His Honour complied with that request (SU 23.11.10 - p 45-51). If there were any concern about those questions, his Honour addressed those concerns by giving directions in accordance with those sought on behalf of the Appellant.

197This ground of appeal has not been made out.

Ground of Appeal 9: That the trial miscarried as a result of the trial judge directing the jury after they commenced their deliberations that they could ""reluctantly agree"" as to their verdict.

198On 29 November 2010 (having retired to consider its verdict on 24 November) the jury provided a note as follows:

""We've only been able to reach a unanimous decision on three counts. The remaining eight we weren't unanimous and are unlikely to be.""

The jury then returned verdicts of guilty in respect of counts 5, 6 and 11. 

199The trial judge gave a ""Black direction"". During the course of that direction, his Honour said:

""Each of you has sworn or affirmed that you will give a true verdict according to the evidence - that is an important responsibility. You must fulfil it to the best of your ability. Each of you takes into the jury room your individual experience and wisdom and you are expected to judge the evidence fairly and impartially in that light. You also have a duty to listen carefully and objectively to the views of every one of your fellow jurors. Again I can only urge that you listen carefully to what each of the others say, calmly weigh up one another's opinions and test them by discussion. Calm and objective discussion of the evidence often leads to a better understanding of the difference of opinion which you may have, and it may convince you that your original opinion was wrong.

This is not to suggest that you can consistently join in a verdict if you do not honestly and genuinely think it is the correct one. Now that is a very important matter and I cannot emphasise it enough. You may go away from here saying to yourself ""Well I really didn't want to do that"" but you have got to be able to say ""I did in fact agree"", reluctant though it was. It would be quite wrong to go away and say ""I didn't agree"". As I said to you before if people do that it throws in doubt the whole system. So you think about it and you decide if you do agree.

Your decision on any of the remaining counts must be unanimous, whether it be guilty or not guilty. There is no possibility of any majority verdict. It has to be a unanimous verdict. All twelve of you - and of course it has to be decided beyond reasonable doubt. Yes, all 10 jurors, I'm sorry not 12 jurors. I'm reading of course from a direction that is given in every case and I am wrong - all 10 of you must agree on the verdict and any verdict, not only has to be unanimous, you have got to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt.

It may be that the particular paths that lead each of you to that unanimous decision are not quite the same, but your verdict of guilty or not guilty must be a verdict of you all. In other words provided you all agree that a particular verdict should be given, it does not matter that you do not agree as to why that particular verdict should be given.

Experience has often shown that juries are able to agree in the end if they are given more time to consider and discuss the evidence. For that reason, judges usually request juries to re-examine matters on which they are in disagreement and to make a further attempt to reach a verdict before they may be discharged."" (SU 29.11.10, 85-87)

200On 30 November 2010 a further note was provided to the trial judge by the jury as follows:

""Would your Honour please clarify ""reasonable doubt"" to assist our understanding? For example, does the presence of any doubt constitute doubt? Can you suggest an example to assist us in this regard? For example, is there a probability weighing or thresh-holding that might apply? Can your Honour please clarify the reluctant agreement, juror finding you referred to yesterday?""

201His Honour responded to the question concerning ""reluctant agreement"" as follows:

""Now reluctant agreement is the second thing and I hope I did not create confusion in saying it. If we take an example far from here there can be many situations in life where there is what could be called reluctant agreement. For example, you may have a son, daughter, or relative or friend who comes to you and says I need a loan, I am really in desperate trouble, please give me $1000 and you reluctantly agree. You say okay, very well, I am a bit short myself but I can see the problem you are in, I will give you $1000 and you hand over the $1000. Now you could say I reluctantly agreed to give it. You cannot say I refused to give it because in fact you did give it, but it was reluctant, you agreed it was an agreement but you found it difficult to come to that agreement. Now reluctant agreement means nothing more than that here. You might find it difficult to come to an agreement, you might rather wish that you did not have to, but you say yes I do agree nevertheless. Now that is a reluctant agreement and we can get many other examples. You can get it in the workplace - an employer might say to an employee ""I want you to go to Queensland next week, you have to go to Brisbane and go by car, then to Bundaberg and you have got to stay there a week and we are doing this work. You might say I do not want to go there, I really do not want to go there, I have got things to do here, I've got lots of things I want to do here and he might say to you ""Well, I am not going to force you, but I would like you to go, it is in the interests of the company that you go."" You weigh it up and you say - All right I would rather not but I will."" Now, it is reluctant but it is an agreement, you cannot say he forced me to, he said he would sack me if I did not because he said I will leave it to you, I could get someone else but really you are the person who is the best placed and the company will suffer if you do not go - so I agree or I do not agree. If I agree, it is reluctant I would rather not but I do. That is a reluctant agreement and here you're being asked to look and say - well even though I find it difficult, yes I do agree, that is my agreement. If I say it is to be contrasted with saying that it is not my agreement but I will give in because I want to go home and then going and telling everyone afterwards I did not agree at all, then people say that is funny, how on earth did that result happen if you did not agree.

So you can be reluctant but you can agree. Now if there is a reasonable possibility of the accused being innocent on any of the remaining charges you should find him not guilty, that is the plain fact, that is what the law says a reasonable possibility of innocence. If there is not, even though it is difficult to find any person guilty of something, then if there is not, that reasonable possibility you should find him guilty. If you are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, you should find him not guilty. If you think there may be a possibility or a probability even that he did it, but I'm not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt you should find him not guilty.

So just to reiterate, you decide what is in the circumstances, your satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt. Unless you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt you find him not guilty. There is a reasonable possibility of innocence, you find him not guilty. If you think he might have done but you cannot be entirely sure you find him not guilty, if even though reluctantly, you think I've got to agree he is guilty, you find him guilty. If the reluctance is on the other side, that people - a lot of people are saying look, we think he is innocent - you are reluctant to say that but eventually you say yes, reluctantly I agree - reluctantly you agree and you agree he is not guilty."" (SU 30.11.10 4.1 - 5.9)

202Senior counsel for the Appellant expressed reservations about the analogies used by his Honour when discussing ""reluctant agreement"". His Honour was not prepared to give further directions on the subject.

203The Appellant submitted that the difficulty with the analogy relating to the $1000 loan was that the loan was between a parent and a child, where other considerations relating to the making of the loan could arise so that the agreement to make the loan might turn out to be a completely unreasonable one. Similarly, the Appellant submitted that in many situations there might be an imbalance of power between an employer and an employee, so that the agreement to travel interstate might not represent a real agreement. The Appellant submitted that this might have distorted the reasoning process followed by the jury.

204It would have been preferable for his Honour not to have raised the concept of ""reluctant agreement"" in his summing up. When asked to explain what he meant by that term, the analogies used by his Honour were not helpful and had the potential to be misunderstood by the jury. Looked at as a whole, however, the effect of his Honour's direction was that in some cases there were agreements which were difficult to come to but that the essential ingredient was that there be genuine agreement.

205The effect of the direction was to remind the jury of the standard of proof, how to approach it and to direct that as long as the jury applied the correct test, they were required to return a unanimous verdict, even if it entailed a degree of reluctance. While it would have been better not to have raised the issue of ""reluctant agreement"", when the summing up is looked at as a whole, the Appellant was not disadvantaged and no injustice occurred.

206What is of particular significance is that following his Honour's directions, the jury still distinguished between outcomes in relation to the various counts in that they were not able to agree on verdicts of guilty for counts 3 and 4.

207The situation is not dissimilar to that referred to by RA Hulme J in FP v R [2012] NSWCCA 182 at [178], although the circumstance being considered by RA Hulme J was somewhat more extreme than that which occurred here:

""178 A usefully thorough review of the many cases concerned with this issue appears in the judgment of Simpson J in RWB v R; R v RWB [2010] NSWCCA 147; (2010) 202 A Crim R 209. In that case, the trial judge embellished the direction as to the standard of proof of his own volition. Whilst it was held that it was wrong for the judge to have done so, what was said was found not to constitute a miscarriage of justice. It did not diminish the standard of proof and was not misleading or confusing as other attempts at elaboration by trial judges had been found to be. The unnecessary addition to the response given by the judge in the present case can be similarly characterised.""

208Even if his Honour were in error, there has been no substantial miscarriage of justice (s6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912). Accordingly, this ground of appeal has not been made out.

209It follows from the above analysis that the Appellant's appeal against conviction should be dismissed.

Application for leave to appeal against sentence

Ground of Appeal 10: That the sentence imposed upon the Appellant was too severe.

210The Appellant was sentenced on 19 April 2012. The delay in sentencing occurred because the Appellant made two applications in the course of the proceedings to the Court of Criminal Appeal. Those applications were unsuccessful. 

211When assessing the objective seriousness of the offence, his Honour said:

""4. Each assault was serious, planned and callous. The offender used his position as a priest to gain access to the homes in which each of his victims lived. Because of his position as a priest and because of his standing in the community generally, he was very trusted and the parents of each of the victims readily gave him access to their daughters because of that trust and the esteem in which he was held.""

212His Honour concluded that the sentences to be imposed should particularly emphasise individual and general deterrence. In that regard, his Honour took into account that the Appellant continued to deny his guilt and showed no remorse.

213In the sentencing proceedings, five matters relating to the Appellant's subjective case were raised:

(1) He was a man of previous good character.

(2) He would serve his sentence in harsh conditions.

(3) His age and health.

(4) Extra curial punishment.

(5) Public humiliation and vilification.

214In relation to his previous good character, his Honour said:

""He has put himself forward as a man of good character and a large number of character testimonials have been tendered... I am prepared to accept that in his life as a priest and since then, apart from this type of offence, he has conducted himself in an exemplary manner. However, it also has to be said that he used his eminence in the community and his role as a priest to gain access to his victims and to carry out sexual offences on them.""

215In relation to (2), his Honour noted that there was no evidence before him that he would serve his sentence in harsh conditions. Although the Appellant had been in a remand facility where he was locked up for all but one hour per day, his Honour noted that after he was sentenced, his conditions would improve substantially. His Honour did not accept that his conditions of imprisonment would be harsh.

216In relation to (3), his Honour noted that the Appellant was 69 years of age and had a problem with his hearing. Otherwise, there was no evidence that the Appellant was suffering from any health problems. 

217In relation to (4) and (5), his Honour said:

""15 As to 4, this seems to be based on evidence of media comments and articles on the Internet including a rather irrational one that talked about murder. I do not accept that any of this amounts to some form of extra curial punishment and I decline to take it into account in any way at all.

16 As to 5, the argument submitted is that there is powerful evidence of public humiliation and vilification of the offender and this should in some way be taken into account in sentence. I do not accept that this should be taken into account in this instance. There may be cases where such consideration would be of relevance. However, there is no basis for lessening the sentence because the arrest of the offender caused a great deal of public comment.""

218Before passing sentence, his Honour summarised the relevant sentencing considerations as follows:

1. Because he was aged 69, a gaol sentence was going to fall very heavily upon him.

2. Apart from these offences, he had led a blameless life and was entitled to the benefit of that good character, however, he used his position as a priest to get access to his victims.

3. The offences were predatory and planned and apart from LH, all of his victims were very young.

4. The offences against MG in counts 8, 9 and 10 were the worst of all of the offences in that they involved very serious sexual misconduct.

5. He had no remorse or contrition which meant that there could be little hope of rehabilitation. He had not sought any counselling or assistance.

6. As the offences were old offences, regard had to be had to sentencing patterns of the past. It was not easy to reach any conclusions about this since there were very few cases involving facts like this. His Honour was unable to find anything to suggest any pattern of sentencing for offenders such as this Appellant who in breach of trust, acted in a predatory way against young children. His breach of trust was worst than most because he used his position as a priest to get access to children.

7. The case was one appropriate for the imposition of an aggregate sentence.

8. The worst offences were counts 9 and 10 and notwithstanding that they were old offences, they were very serious. Accordingly, his Honour proposed to impose the maximum sentence for those offences.

9. There must be a considerable degree of concurrence, otherwise the overall sentence would be too great. Offences 9 and 10 were committed at the same time and the proper application of sentencing principles meant that those two sentences would have to be wholly concurrent.

10. There must be cumulation of sentences and the aggregate sentence would reflect that.

11. His Honour found special circumstances arising from the Appellant's age and the fact that this was the first time he had been imprisoned.

219His Honour determined the individual sentences as follows:

Counts 5 and 6 - 3 years imprisonment.

Counts 1 and 2 - 4 years imprisonment.

Count 7 - 1 year imprisonment.

Count 8 - 5 years imprisonment.

Counts 9 and 10 - 6 years imprisonment.

Count 11 - 3 years imprisonment.

As previously indicated, the total sentence imposed was imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years with a balance of term of 3 years. The commencement of the imprisonment was backdated to 30 November 2010. The Appellant would be eligible for release on parole on 29 November 2015.

Appellant's submissions and consideration

220The Appellant submitted that his Honour erred in not finding that he had been subjected to extra curial punishment. This submission was based primarily on evidence given by the Appellant's wife in the sentence proceedings.

221Her evidence was that she and the Appellant married in September 2004. She had a child from a previous marriage, who was aged about five and a half at the time of the Appellant's arrest. Another child was born in November 2004. She said that as a result of the arrest and conviction of the Appellant, the Department of Community Services removed the children and it was only when proceedings in the Children's Court at Parramatta were dismissed that the children were allowed to return home. She said that the Appellant had not been allowed to see the children since the date of his arrest.

222His wife gave evidence of threats which were made against her and the children. There was a particular threat made online to the effect that she and the children would be sliced up into little pieces so that the world could see what happens to the families of [paedophiles]. She said that the police had done little to protect the family and that these threats and the substantial amount of adverse publicity were having a very deleterious effect on the health of the Appellant.

223There was a report from Dr Roberts to the effect that when he interviewed the Appellant in prison, he was depressed and one of the reasons for that depression was the threats which had been made against his family.

224The Appellant relied upon the observations of Kirby J in Ryan v R [2001] HCA 21; 206 CLR 267 at [123] where his Honour said:

""123 I agree with Callinan J[127] that in sentencing a prisoner such as the Appellant, account might properly be taken of the particular features to which such a prisoner is exposed, including the additional opprobrium, adverse publicity, public humiliation and personal, social and family stress which he suffered. Thus, in re-sentencing the present Appellant, it might be appropriate to fix a custodial sentence proper to his case taking into consideration, in a general way, the extent to which the Appellant is now publicly identified as a paedophile as a result of the criminal proceedings taken against him. Where this occurs, the stigma will commonly add a significant element of shame and isolation to the prisoner and the prisoner's family. This may comprise a special burden that is incidental to the punishment imposed and connected with it. If properly based on evidence, it could, in a particular case, be just to take such considerations into account in fixing the judicial punishment required.""

225Evidence was also given by the Appellant's wife to the effect that she had been told by him that he was treated in a humiliating and contemptuous way on occasions by Corrective Services staff. She gave evidence concerning the harsh conditions he had endured while on remand awaiting sentence.

226It is accepted that in certain circumstances extra curial punishment can be taken into account in the sentencing process. In Regina v Daetz; Regina v Wilson [2003] NSWCCA 216; 139 A Crim R 398 at [62] James J (with whom Tobias JA and RS Hulme J agreed) said:

""62 ... while it is the function of the courts to punish persons who have committed crimes, a sentencing court, in determining what sentence it should impose on an offender, can properly take into account that the offender has already suffered some serious loss or detriment as a result of having committed the offence. This is so, even where the detriment the offender has suffered has taken the form of extra curial punishment by private persons exacting retribution or revenge for the commission of the offence. In sentencing the offender the court takes into account what extra-curial punishment the offender has suffered, because the court is required to take into account all material facts and is required to ensure that the punishment the offender receives is what in all the circumstances is an appropriate punishment and not an excessive punishment. How much weight a sentencing judge should give any extra curial punishment will, of course, depend on all the circumstances of the case. Indeed, there may well be many cases where extra-judicial punishment attracts little or no significant weight.""

227His Honour was aware of the online threat, but declined to give it any weight because of its extreme nature. His Honour was entitled to do so. There was no evidence of anything being done by any person to implement this threat. There was no evidence of any other specific threats.

228His Honour took into account that offences of this kind when discovered and punished, usually involve public humiliation and some level of vilification. His Honour did not consider that the evidence before him justified him doing anything more than recording the submission. The approach of his Honour was in line with that of Howie J in Kenny v R [2010] NSWCCA 6 at [49] where he said:

""49 ... My initial reaction was that public humiliation that arises from the commission of the offence should not alone give rise to a mitigation of sentence without more. However having regard to what Basten JA has written about this matter, the issue appears to be unresolved in the High Court and need not be determined for the purpose of disposing of this ground of appeal. Clearly there may be an exceptional case where it reaches such proportion that it has had some physical or psychological effect on the person so that it could be taken into account as additional punishment. That was in effect the position in Allpass. It was also the position in R v King [2009] NSWCCA 117 where media coverage of the respondent's sentence resulted in threats to him and made him a virtual prisoner in his own home.""

229Following Kenny, Basten JA (with whom Blanch and Hall JJ agreed) in Duncan v R [2012] NSWCCA 78, a case where there had been fourteen months of ""vitriolic attacks verbally and on Facebook and a wealth of adverse material in print on radio and TV"", said:

""29 This was not a case in which the applicant suffered public humiliation or vilification as a person having a high profile in the community, but rather because of the enormity of her conduct and the fact that it had a wide impact within a small community. The fact of such a public response is less important for itself, rather than for its effect on the applicant. The sentencing judge took account of the psychologist's report prepared by Dr Katie Seidler, a clinical and forensic psychologist. Dr Seidler noted that she had symptoms of depressed mood, but also noted that she had been on an anti-depressant drug since mid-adolescence: paragraphs 44 and 45. She reported having attempted to take her life on four occasions, two preceding the crash and two thereafter. There were no symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder: paragraph 47. The applicant was described as ""tearful and upset in describing how she does not believe she will cope in prison and how she is scared of being the victim of assault in custody"": paragraph 49. Reference was made in the same passage to her degree of upset at being separated from her children. Although noting that the applicant was suffering from ""considerable emotional distress and psychological disturbance across almost all domains of functioning"" there was no clear identification of a psychological disorder of a moderate to severe kind, or of one which could readily be traced to the crash itself.""

230The report of Dr Roberts, other than indicating a level of depression on the part of the Appellant did not indicate a more than usual reaction to the publicity consequences of his actions. Moreover, the reasons put forward by Dr Roberts as contributing to the Appellant's depression go beyond the public humiliation associated with his arrest and conviction. They related to certain remarks said to have been made by the trial judge (which were disputed (CUR 24 v DPP [2012] NSWCA 65)).

231On the evidence before his Honour, it was open to him to reach the conclusion which he did concerning the effect on the Appellant of his public humiliation as a result of his arrest and conviction.

232The question of the Appellant's inability to see his children while he has been in custody appears to relate to a dispute between him and the Department of Community Services and does not relate directly to these offences. In the absence of further evidence, neither his Honour nor this Court can take that matter into account.

233It follows that I am not persuaded that his Honour erred in his treatment of the matters which were placed before him under the heading ""Extra Curial Punishment"".

234The Appellant submitted that his Honour erred in failing to give adequate weight to his age and health in the sentencing process. Simply expressing the Appellant's submission is indicative of the problem associated with it. His Honour clearly took these matters into account. The complaint is that he did not give them sufficient weight. That, of course, involves a challenge to his Honour's sentencing discretion and unless clear error is identified, such a submission cannot succeed.

235In this case his Honour did take into account the Appellant's age and noted that ""a gaol sentence is going to fall very hard on him"". His Honour also took it into account when making a finding of special circumstances. The ratio between the non-parole period and the total sentence was 55 percent. His Honour was correct to observe that in relation to the Appellant's health generally, ""he was [not] in any particular state of bad health"".

236It is true that the report of Dr Roberts described the Appellant as being ""stressed"" and that he ""presented in a manner consistent with depression"". That is not unexpected, given that the Appellant had at that time spent a considerable period in custody. His description of the Appellant when he visited him (approximately four days before he was to be sentenced) was unremarkable. In particular, Dr Roberts did not regard the level of depression as sufficient to require medication.

237No error in his Honour's approach to the Appellant's age or state of health has been made out.

238The Appellant submitted that his Honour erred in not adequately taking into account his previous good character. Once again, this submission suffers from the weakness previously referred to, i.e., it challenges the extent to which the sentencing judge took a matter into account and therefore challenges the sentencing judge's exercise of discretion.

239His Honour's approach to the Appellant's character was unexceptionable. The Appellant received the benefit of the fact that he had ""conducted himself in an exemplary manner"" during his life, except for this series of offences. His honour remarked ""Apart from these offences, he has led a blameless life and is entitled to the benefit of that good character"". This is not the situation which arose in Ryan where the sentencing judge entirely disregarded the Appellant's good character because of the nature of his offending.

240What his Honour did in this case was to also take into account the counter balancing consideration that it was as a result of his position in the community that the Appellant was able to gain access to his victims and commit offences against them. This was a legitimate approach. What is clear, however, is that his Honour did take the Appellant's previous good character into account as a matter in mitigation of sentence and as a matter which favoured him.

241Error in his Honour's approach to the Appellant's previous good character has not been made out.

242The Appellant submitted that his Honour did not have proper regard to sentencing practices at the time of the offending, i.e. between 1976 and 1981. The Appellant submitted that a substantial quantity of material was placed before his Honour, including cases where this principle had been applied, but that his Honour had not properly taken those matters into account. In particular, his Honour had not taken into account the relatively low ratio between non-parole periods and head sentences prevalent at the time, i.e. that non-parole periods were often less than 50 percent of the head sentence.

243The Appellant submitted that his Honour's statement that there are ""very few cases involving facts like this"" was indicative of his failure to give proper consideration to the cases to which he was referred. The Appellant submitted that in a number of those cases, the offending conduct was much more serious than in his case and that in nearly all of the cases, there was a serious breach of trust as the offenders were either the father or some other relative of the victim.

244It is clear from his Honour's remarks on sentence that he accepted ""As the offences are old offences, regard has to be had to sentencing patterns of the past"". The criticism by the Appellant is that having recognised the principle, his Honour failed to apply it appropriately.

245A matter which was troubling his Honour was that although he had been referred to historical cases, none were truly comparable because none involved the same degree of breach of trust and predatory conduct. This was a clear reference to the ""Table of sentences imposed for comparable cases"" which had been provided to his Honour and which listed thirteen cases. Some of those cases related to similar or more serious types of indecent assaults. Some of those cases involved a breach of trust in that the offence was committed by a family member. However, as his Honour pointed out, there were no cases involving facts such as were before him, except perhaps the matter of Ryan. In Ryan, of course, the offences were more serious and the sentences were substantially heavier.

246The significant matters which his Honour took into account were that the Appellant had offended against three victims for more than five years and had used his position as a priest to gain access to them. It was accepted by the defence on sentence that the offending entailed a gross breach of trust. It was not, as the Appellant's submissions assert, that his Honour was ""preoccupied"" with the nature of the breach of trust. Rather, the nature of the breach of trust was a very distinctive part of the offending and constituted a most important consideration when assessing the objective seriousness of the offences individually and the offending as a whole.

247When one takes into account the following matters, it is clear that his Honour did have regard to historical sentencing patterns and that had the Appellant been sentenced in accordance with current sentencing standards, his sentence would have been substantially longer. There were three complainants and the offending took place over 5 years. All offences involved indecent assaults. There were 9 offences. The maximum penalty for all but the last offence was 6 years imprisonment. The last offence had a maximum penalty of 4 years imprisonment. Although his Honour imposed an aggregate sentence, there was a considerable degree of concurrence. The offences against PR involved some force and those against MG were predatory in nature and escalated over time.

248Against that background, and given the unusual features of the offending, it cannot be said that his Honour failed to have regard to sentencing principles appropriate to offences which had been committed many years in the past.

249The Appellant submitted that his Honour's approach to fixing indicative sentences was erroneous in that he imposed the maximum penalty (6 years imprisonment) in respect of counts 9 and 10. 

250In relation to those counts, his Honour said:

""The worst offences are counts 9 and 10 and I have decided to impose a maximum sentence on him for these two offences. This reflects my view that notwithstanding the offences are old ones, they are very serious ones. The maximum sentence available is really not sufficient, but if any offender engaged in such actions now he would be liable to larger penalties for offences that are now expressed somewhat differently.""

251The Appellant submitted that while the conduct amounted to a gross breach of trust, the nature of the acts involved could not be regarded as the worst case of indecent assault. This was particularly so when it was conceded by the Crown in submissions that the offences overlapped. The Appellant submitted that whether there were now in existence greater penalties for the offences was irrelevant. The correct inquiry was where in the range of the then available sentences the Appellant's conduct stood.

252Some of the indicative sentences set out by his Honour are high. That is not determinative. Button J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Garling J agreed) said in Truong v R; R v Le; Nguyen v R; R v Nguyen [2013] NSWCCA 36 at [227]:

""227 ... However, it must be remembered that the indicative head sentences cannot be the subject of an appeal to this Court. It is only the aggregate head sentence and aggregate non-parole period that can be the subject of an appeal. It follows that it is not a matter of this Court analysing each indicative sentence and determining whether it is erroneous. Rather, it is a matter of looking at the whole of the sentencing structure in order to determine whether the aggregate sentence can stand or not.""

253In PD v R [2012] NSWCCA 242 at [44] Beech-Jones J (Basten JA and Hall J agreeing) said in relation to appeals against aggregate sentences:

""44 ... An indicative sentence is not itself amenable to appeal but an ""erroneous approach in the indication of the sentence that would have been imposed for an offence may well reveal error in the aggregate sentence reached"" (R v Brown [2012] NSWCCA 199 at [17] per Grove AJ with whom Macfarlan JA and McCallum J agreed). However, that is not necessarily the case. The materiality of any error in an indicative sentence to the overall aggregate sentence will need to be demonstrated before this Court would intervene. ... ""

254Given the seriousness of the offending in counts 9 and 10, the aggregate sentence while high was within the range of sentences for offences of this kind. No error has been demonstrated in the aggregate sentence imposed by his Honour. Even if there were error, no lesser sentence is warranted in law (s6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912).

Conclusion

255The orders which I propose are as follows:

(1) With respect to Grounds of Appeal 1 - 9, the appeal is dismissed.

(2) Leave to appeal is granted with respect to Ground of Appeal 10 but the appeal is dismissed.

256DAVIES J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

257ADAMSON J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

		12 July 2013",2013-05-23 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2706707,Hamzy v District Court of NSW [2013] NSWCA 130,"Judgment
1BASTEN ACJ:  This matter was listed this afternoon by the Court, in order to consider the status of an order made on 10 May 2013.  On that day, the Court made a suppression order in respect of ""the evidence and transcript before Judge Zahra"", the District Court judge who had sentenced the applicant on a number of matters that morning.
2There were no papers before this Court, a matter which has now been attended to by the filing of a summons and notice of motion.
3In its terms, the order made was ambiguous: it could have been understood as preventing publication of any account of the evidence or the submissions which appeared in the judgment of the sentencing judge.  However, as would have been clear from the reasons given contemporaneously, that was not the intention.  Rather, the assumption on which the order was based was that Zahra DCJ, having originally suppressed publication of the evidence given in the course of sentencing proceeding on 27 April 2012, on a basis required to be stated under s 8 of the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW), would not then have revealed in reasons delivered in open court, and without the protection of a non-publication order, matters which he did not intend to be made public.  Nevertheless, I was prepared to accept that, if the original suppression order had ceased to have effect when judgment was delivered, there might still be a sound basis for continuing to protect that information which had been disclosed originally in closed court and was not referred to in the judgment.  I further accepted that, although it might have been thought surprising, the District Court had omitted to continue the effect of the suppression order for that limited purpose.  That was the reason for the order I made.
4Since last Friday afternoon when the order was made, there have been two developments.  
5First, counsel appearing for the applicant had noted, as recorded in the reasons given last Friday, that any appeal from the making or failure to make such an order lay to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  He indicated that his client intended to bring proceedings in that Court.  That course was taken.  However, with a degree of temerity, counsel made application to that Court on Tuesday, 14 May 2013, for a suppression order different from that made by me, with the ostensible purpose of extending the scope of its coverage.  One possible response would have been to note that the proper place to review an order made by a single judge of this Court was before three judges of the Court: Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW), s 46(4).  However, a judge sitting in the Court of Criminal Appeal took a different view and made orders ""on an interim basis"" in the following terms:
""That the suppression orders and non-publication orders made by his Honour Judge Peter Zahra SC on 25 July 2011 and 27 April 2012 be continued until further order of the Court.""
6The order made on 25 July 2011 related to the identity of a person known only as ""OS1"".  The order appears to have been unrelated to the present application.  The order made in the District Court on 27 April 2012 prohibited disclosure of information given by Bassam Hamzy and other evidence led in the sentencing proceedings then on foot.
7The record on JusticeLink does not indicate the full extent of that order, or that it was limited in any way or that it has been lifted or varied by the District Court.  However, JusticeLink appears to be incomplete.  The order was geographically limited and applied in terms ""from today up to the date of passing of the sentence for which the offender appears before me"".  The order made in the Court of Criminal Appeal would appear to prevent disclosure of any information supplied in the course of the sentencing proceedings, including that disclosed in the judgment.  Because there can have been no purpose in seeking any lesser order (given the order I had made on the previous Friday) I assume that to be the purpose and effect of the order made in the Court of Criminal Appeal.
8If there had been publication of the content of the reasons for judgment on sentence between the date of my order and the date of the order in the Court of Criminal Appeal, an issue might arise as to the effect of the latter order.  That can remain for another day.  The issue at present is whether the order which I made should remain on foot.  In my view it should not.  It is not consistent with the order made by the Court of Criminal Appeal and to avoid any dispute as to its operation or effectiveness, I propose to revoke it.
9The second matter which has arisen since the hearing last Friday in this Court is that, having had access to the transcript of the District Court proceedings of 27 April 2012 to determine the terms of the order actually made by Zahra DCJ, it became apparent to me that matters which were referred to in the course of the hearing in this Court were the subject matter of the suppression order made in the District Court and were probably not referred to in the reasons for judgment given in the District Court, which I still have not seen.  Accordingly, I propose to make an order suppressing disclosure of such information supplied to me at the hearing on 10 May 2013 and recorded in the transcript.  This will complete the present proceedings.
10Accordingly, I make the following orders:
(1) Revoke the suppression order made by this Court on 10 May 2013.
(2) Order that the information conveyed to this Court relating to information disclosed by Bassam Hamzy and other evidence led in the course of his sentencing proceedings, not be disclosed or published in any form until further order of this Court or the Court of Criminal Appeal.
(3) Otherwise dismiss the summons.

		20 May 2013",2013-05-16 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2706721,R v Stani-Reginald [2013] NSWSC 567,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE 

1His Honour: On 1 February 2013, Daniel Stani-Reginald (the offender) was arraigned on an indictment containing three counts. The offender pleaded guilty to the murder of Tosha Thakkar on 9 March 2011 (count 1). He also pleaded guilty to having sexual intercourse with Tosha Thakkar on 9 March 2011 without her consent, knowing that she was not consenting in circumstances of aggravation, namely that at the time of the offence, he occasioned actual bodily harm to her (count two). This is an offence of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61J(1) Crimes Act 1900. The Crown did not seek a plea to count 3 which was a charge of aggravated sexual assault contrary to s 61J(1), but the court was informed that the offence would be placed on a Form 1 pursuant to s 33 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

2When the offender appeared before me on 29 April 2013, he adhered to his pleas of guilty. He asked that the offence of aggravated sexual assault that had been placed on a Form 1 be taken into account on sentence for count 2. At his request, I will do so. 

3The 'sexual intercourse' relied on for count 2 is the penetration of the deceased's anus by the offender's penis or an object manipulated by him whereas the 'sexual intercourse' relied for the offence on the Form 1 is the penetration of the deceased's vagina by the offender's penis or an object manipulated by him. 

4Tosha Thakkar was sexually assaulted by the offender and then strangled by him with the use of a ligature. The deceased was 24 years old at the time of her death. She had to come to Australia from India in 2007 to pursue her tertiary studies and was in her first semester of the third year of an accounting degree at University. 

5The maximum penalty for the crime of murder is imprisonment for life. A standard non-parole period of 20 years imprisonment has been prescribed. The maximum penalty for an offence contrary to s 61J(1) is 20 years imprisonment with a prescribed standard non-parole period of 10 years imprisonment. 

6The maximum penalty and standard non-parole period for an offence are legislative guideposts that are to be born in mind when the court comes to a consideration of the appropriate penalty, having regard to the objective circumstances of the offence and the subjective features of the offender: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120. The standard non-parole period does not have determinative significance in sentencing the offender: Muldrock at [31], nor is it a ""starting point"" for the sentence, nor does it directly apply as the offender has pleaded guilty.

7During the proceedings on sentence, Mr M Tedeschi QC appeared for the Crown and Mr N Steel for the offender. 

8A document entitled FACTS ON SENTENCE (ex A T1) was tendered by the Crown. The offender acknowledges that its contents are an accurate account of the evidence in the Crown case. As this document consists of 21 pages, I shall set out my findings of fact as succinctly as possible. 

9The findings of fact I make against the offender must be arrived at beyond reasonable doubt. Matters of mitigation may be proved on the balance of probabilities: R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; (1999) 199 CLR 270. 

10The deceased and the offender resided in a boarding house in Croydon. The deceased resided in unit 2 and the offender in unit 3. The distance from unit 2 to unit 3 was around 1.54 metres. Thin ply wood type makeshift walls separated the units. A communal bathroom was around 5 metres from the entrance of unit 2. 

11Between 29 December 2010 and 11 February 2011 numerous searches were conducted by the offender on his laptop relating to persons convicted of murder and sexual assault. Wikipedia pages, web pages, newspaper articles, NSW Supreme Court judgments (mostly sentencing remarks) relating to murder and sexual assault were accessed online on numerous occasions. The searches on the internet included 'lez murphy' who was one of five men sentenced for the rape and murder of Anita Cobby; 'Anthony Sowell', known as the 'Cleveland Strangler', a serial killer who was convicted of around 20 counts of murder, rape and kidnapping; 'Peter Sutcliffe the Yorkshire Ripper' who had murdered 13 women and 'Richard Ramirez', who was convicted and sentenced for 13 counts of murder and 11 counts of sexual assault. The 'Richard Ramirez' and 'carr brothers' websites were searched on many occasions. Reginald and Jonathan Carr were convicted of murder of 5 men and women. They sexually assaulted their victims before murdering them. 

12On 12 February 2011, the offender purchased a large suitcase from Target Burwood. In the evening, the offender accessed various websites and articles on his laptop computer. One such article related to the murder of a child by his mother who put him in a suitcase that was later retrieved from a duck pond in Ambarvale. Wikipedia pages relating to Christopher Widler and Bill Glaze were accessed. Christopher Widler was a serial killer who abducted and raped at least 12 women and he killed eight of them. Billy Glaze was convicted of killing three women. The website claims that he believed that all native women should be raped and killed. 

13Website searches of persons convicted of rape and murder were conducted by the offender between 13 February 2011 and 8 March 2011. The websites visited by the offender included 'gary ridgway' who was convicted of 49 murders. After having sex with his victims, Ridgway would strangle them by the use of his hands or ligatures. 'Park family murders' website was also searched. Nick Park was convicted of the murder of his wife and two children, whose bodies were found stuffed in suitcases dumped in bushland. 

14The term 'body found in suitcase' was used in search engines on five occasions on 19 February 2011. The websites visited included the murder of a woman in New York whose body was found in a suitcase. A cord had been used to strangle the victim. 

15On 28 February 2011, two searches were conducted using the term 'Meadowbank Park'. Following those searches, a map on the website www.google.com was accessed of the Meadowbank park area, including the storm water canal that the deceased's body was located in as well as Crowley Crescent where the offender alighted from the taxi with the deceased's body. Other websites searched by the offender included those relating to serial killers such as the 'Daytona Beach killer', the 'Milwaukee North Side Strangler' and the 'Noida serial murders'.

16On 8 March 2011, Phillip Culbert, the tenant of unit 1, arrived home to see the deceased, her boyfriend Ali Syed and the offender in the hallway. The keys to the deceased's unit were locked inside. The construction of the room was such that there was a gap between the top of the wall and the ceiling separating the deceased's room and the hallway. The offender successfully helped the deceased gain access to her room. Mr Syed and the deceased thanked the offender for his assistance.

17On the same day, the offender's internet searches related to rapes and murders. His visits to pornographic websites included one titled 'Arse Fucking my Virgin Girlfriend'.

18On 8 and 9 March 2011, the offender called in sick to work. The offender was employed as a box boy and in that role he used Stanley knives and cable ties. 

19On the morning of the murder, the offender's access to various websites included Wikepedia pages entitled 'Chokehold' and 'Grappling Hold' and articles relating to sexual assault. Pornographic websites that related to girls of Indian descent were searched between 11:30am and 11:36am. 

20Mr Syed called and spoke with the deceased at around 10:15am on 9 March 2011. They arranged to meet at 1pm for lunch before her 2pm class.

21The deceased called Mr Syed at 10:33am. The deceased told Mr Syed that she was preparing rice for lunch, then showering, and would call him again when she was leaving for the train station. She never called. 

22An examination of the deceased's computer revealed that the computer was switched on at 10:53am, documents were accessed at 11:11am, and a compilation of Hindi music from the website 'YOU TUBE' was accessed at 11:48am. The next user interaction was at 4:36pm. 

23At 12:09pm, Mr Syed attempted to call the deceased without success. Between 12:09pm and 1pm Mr Syed and his friends attempted to call the deceased on 26 occasions.

24Mr Culbert had returned from work to unit 1 after 12:17pm. He noticed that the light was on in unit 2 and heard Hindi music that was louder than usual. He assumed Mr Syed and the deceased were inside the unit. 

25At around 12:30pm, Mr Culbert heard the deceased making a grunting sound that lasted around one second. He thought she was having an argument with her boyfriend.

26Mr Culbert went to sleep. At 12:47pm Mr Culbert received a call from his brother. The music was no longer audible from unit 2 and he did not hear any other sounds from that room. Mr Culbert did however hear the slide bolt of the deceased's room and movement in the hallway. 

27At 12:53pm the offender conducted a search on his laptop for 'Premier Cabs'. At 12:54pm the offender called Premier Taxis from his mobile phone to arrange a taxi. At 1:01pm, the offender received an automated text that read ""Taxi 7777 is 0.25 km away...""

28At around this time, Mr Culbert and his brother heard movement outside Mr Culbert's room and the sound of a bump in the hallway. The offender was carrying a suitcase down the rear stairs of the building. He wheeled the bag along the rear lane and around to Edwin Street. At approximately 1:03pm a taxi arrived. The taxi driver asked the offender to cross the road so they could continue travelling North. The offender said, ""no, I've got this bag, can you come and help me?"" The taxi driver helped the offender pick up the suitcase and put it in the boot of the taxi. He asked the offender why the bag was so heavy. The offender replied, ""I've got laptop computers and electrical stuff in it. That's why its [sic] very heavy...I've just finished work. I'm going home"". The driver told police that the suitcase weighed over 60 kg. 

29The offender asked the taxi driver to take him to an address at Crowley Crescent in Melrose Park. The taxi driver told police that for most of the journey the offender was doing something on his mobile phone but as they approached the Rhodes area the offender asked the taxi driver about his work and whether his day had been busy. 

30When the taxi entered Crowley Crescent, the driver pointed to the house that correlated with the address provided. The offender said ""no keep going"". He directed the driver 50 metres away from the house to a bend in the road where the pathway leads to Meadowbank Park. The taxi driver offered to help the offender with his bag; however, the offender refused and stated, ""no, problem, its [sic] got wheels"". The offender paid for the fare in cash. 

31The offender retrieved the suitcase from the boot of the taxi at around 1:24pm and wheeled the suitcase east from Crowley Crescent towards the storm water canal. 

32Workmen were undertaking repairs near the junction of the storm water canal and Parramatta River, which was around 56 metres from the T Junction of the Crowley Crescent pathway and the walking path. At approximately 1:30pm, the workmen saw a person matching the offender's general description. The offender pushed the suitcase from chest height over the fence into the storm water canal. The workmen saw the suitcase floating in the canal. The tide was high. 

33By 2pm, Mr Syed was concerned that he could not reach the deceased so he decided to drive to Croydon. Upon his arrival, Mr Syed heard Hindi music coming from the deceased's unit which was unlocked. He entered the unit and discovered a pot of cooked rice on the stove, her personal items were all inside the room, and her university clothing was on the end of the bed. 

34Mr Syed noticed that the thongs that she would wear to the communal bathroom were inside her unit but they were in an unusual position and were wet. He also noticed that the deceased's bath towel was damp. The only thing Mr Syed noticed that was missing was her purple/maroon sleeveless dress that she wore to walk between her unit and the common bathroom. 

35At around 4.30pm, the offender told Mr Syed that he had not seen the deceased. When questioned by police shortly before 6pm, the offender said that he had seen the deceased coming from her room ""yesterday morning"". The offender used his laptop between 6.26pm and 7pm to visit various websites and articles that included ""Beginnings of a Serial Killer.""

36On the morning of 11 March 2011, the workmen retrieved the suitcase from the canal. They noticed that a black plastic cable tie sealed the zippers. The workmen cut the side of the bag with a knife and discovered human remains. They immediately called 000 at around 8am. 

37Police arrived and conveyed the suitcase to the Department of Forensic Medicine at Glebe where it was opened. The deceased's body was inside the suitcase. A Stanley type knife was located on top of the deceased as were a black hair band and bobby pin. The deceased's body was in a foetal position and was dressed in a short sleeve purple/maroon dress that had been cut by a sharp instrument from the centre neckline all the way down to the bottom hem causing it to be completely opened. The zipper at the rear of the dress was still intact and open by 7cm from the top. The deceased's arms were in the armholes of the dress. The deceased was not wearing underpants. 

38A black coaxial television antenna cord around 5mm in diameter was twice wrapped tightly around the neck of the deceased, overlapping on the posterior-lateral aspect of the neck. The ends of the cords were twisted into a tight knot on the anterior lateral aspect. There were at least four twists in the knot. 

39Dr Brouwer, who conducted the post mortem, observed underlying horizontal ligature marks with areas of bruising below them. Linear abrasions just above the left clavicle and just below the lower jaw were noted as were similar abrasions below the chin. The appearance of these injuries was in keeping with being caused by fingernails. Dr Brouwer opined that it was not possible to say exactly how long the deceased was conscious or alive after the ligature was applied around her neck. The fingernail abrasions suggested to Dr Brouwer that the deceased was at least aware of the ligature being applied to her neck and she initially attempted to remove the ligature in self-defence. 

40Dr Brouwer noted haemorrhages in the face and conjunctiva of the left lower eyelid. Blunt trauma injuries were seen to the face, lips and inner aspect of the right arm. Bruising was present in the subcutaneous tissues associated with those injuries. Dr Brouwer expressed the opinion that the bruising suggested that the injury occurred prior to death. Dr Brouwer noted other injuries to the genitalia and anus. Dr Brouwer concluded that the direct cause of death was ligature strangulation and the deceased's injuries were sustained during vaginal and anal penetration that occurred close to the time of death. The injuries to the genitalia and anus were consistent with having been caused by blunt trauma with a penis or object. 

41I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender murdered the deceased between 12:30pm and 12:47pm on 9 March 2011 in her room at the boarding house. At some point between 11:48am and 12:30pm, he had confronted the deceased who had recently showered and was only wearing a purple maroon dress. He assaulted her causing injuries to her face, lips and right arm. He had anal and vaginal intercourse using his penis or an object against the deceased's will. Prior to her death, the offender wrapped the coaxial television antenna cord twice around the deceased's neck and applied pressure to the neck. The deceased tried to remove the ligature but was unable to do so. The offender strangled her by tightening the cord causing her death. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender intended to kill the deceased. 

42I find that the duration of the attack was more than momentary. The offender was able to subdue the deceased and penetrate her anally and vaginally before causing her death using the ligature. The objective seriousness of the sexual assault is enhanced by the considerable violence that accompanied it and by the degrading nature of the anal intercourse: R v Russell (NSWCCA, 21 June 1996, unreported). The offence on the Form 1 that involves vaginal intercourse is serious in its own right. It is an aggravating factor that the deceased was attacked in the room of the boarding house where she lived. Although the offender was lawfully in the boarding house, he was not lawfully in the deceased's room: DSR v R [2012] NSWCCA 159 at [145]. 

43It may never be known for low long the cord was applied to the deceased's neck and whether it was applied, before, during or after she was sexually assaulted. The deceased was alive when the ligature was wrapped around her neck and she struggled to remove it. Notwithstanding her efforts to survive, the offender strangled her which was extraordinarily cruel. The last minutes of her life must have been horrifying. This was a terrible way for the deceased to die. 

44The offender then manoeuvred the deceased's body into the black suitcase that he had purchased on 12 February 2011. He used a black cable tie to secure the zipper tabs together. At some point before the body was placed in the suitcase, he had cut the front of the deceased's dress from the neckline all the way to the bottom hem causing it to be completely open. 

45The callousness with which the murder was committed is disclosed in the calm manner in which the offender booked the taxi, travelled to Meadowbank and disposed of the body. His lack of empathy for the enormity of his crimes is demonstrated by the websites that he visited on the evening of the murder. 

46I do not agree with Mr Steel's submission that the court could not be satisfied to the criminal standard that the killing of the deceased was planned prior to the day of the murder. As Dr Skinner observes (ex A T19 p12):

""There is documented evidence that [the offender] had been planning for similar offences over a period of years, gradually becoming more focussed."" 

47Dr Skinner refers to the offender's inappropriate interest in discussing serious criminal offences including mass rape and murder that is recorded in the youth officer's report on 1 June 2007 and to the drawings in 2008 of an explicitly sexual and violent nature. The Facts on Sentence disclose the offender's discussions with his brother Reegan in 2009 about raping girls and hitting them.

48The only rational inference that can be drawn from the combination of the offender's internet searches that included websites and articles relating to murder, rape and serial offenders, the use of strangulation including ligatures in murders, the use of suitcases in the disposal of bodies, the searches of the Meadowbank park area and the purchase of the suitcase, is that the offender planned to sexually assault and kill a woman and dispose of her body with the use of a suitcase well before the murder of the deceased. 

49The offender's plan was brought to a head by the selection of the deceased as his victim, which appears to have arisen from their meeting on the day before the murder. His visits to websites on the morning of the murder that included the Wikipedia pages entitled ""Chokehold"" and ""Grappling Hold"" and the various pornographic websites relating to girls of Indian descent speak of his plan to sexually assault and murder the deceased. I accept Dr Skinner's opinion that the searching of the pornographic websites shortly before the murder was ""intended to provide stimulation for him and a degree of sexual arousal prior to committing the offences..."" (TOS 29/4/13 T37 L50, T38 L1-2). I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offences involved a high degree of planning and were premeditated. The deceased had done nothing to provoke the attack upon her. 

50However, I do not accept Mr Crown's invitation to find that before the murder the offender intended to commit multiple sexual assaults and murders, that he killed the deceased because he wanted to become a serial murderer and serial rapist and that the deceased was his first victim. Although the offender accessed websites of serial killers before and after the murder, there is no evidence that he purchased more than one suitcase or visited websites of areas other than Meadowbank Park or had other methods of killing or disposing of bodies of future victims. I am unable to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that before the murder, the offender intended to sexually assault and murder more than one person. 

51Mr Steel acknowledged that the sexual assault upon the deceased was a matter to be taken into account in assessing the objective seriousness of the murder and R v Garforth (NSWCCA, 23 May 1994, unreported) was cited. In my view, the offender's violent sexual offending that immediately preceded the deceased's death significantly increases the objective seriousness of the murder. I firmly bear in mind the need to ensure there is no double counting in the sentences to be imposed. 

52Given all the matters I have mentioned, I consider that both the murder and the aggravated sexual assault fall within the worst category of offences of their kind. 

53The offender was born on 23 August 1991 and was 19 years old when the offences were committed. He is now 21 years old. His prior criminal history as a young person, which commenced when he was fourteen reveals offences of violence. His record includes two counts of armed robbery with an offensive weapon (2005); one count of custody of a knife in a public place (2006); four counts of assault with intent to rob (2006); one count of stalk/intimidate with intent to cause fear (2007); two counts of damaging property by fire (2007) and two counts of assault with intent to rob armed with an offensive weapon (2008). A factual summary of these offences is contained in ex A T7. There is one minor offence as an adult for which he was convicted and fined in the Local Court. 

54The control orders imposed by the Children's Court for the offences of assault with intent to rob in 2006 and damaging property by fire in 2007 did not deter him from further offending. 

55The offender's criminal history does not entitle him to leniency, but it does not increase the objective seriousness of the murder and the aggravated sexual assault, nor is it an objective circumstance for the purpose of the application of the proportionality principle and it does not determine the upper boundary of a proportionate sentence: R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; (2006) NSWLR 566. In view of the offender's prior record, I give more weight to personal deterrence and protection of society than otherwise would have been the case: Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465.

56The offender did not give evidence during the proceedings on sentence. His subjective circumstances are drawn from the Juvenile Justice background reports (ex A T15-16). Unfortunately, these reports are confined to the offender's subjective circumstances prior to 21 January 2009 and do not provide any information after that time. All that is known of the offender as an adult is provided by the Facts on Sentence. At the time of the murder, he was employed as a box boy and lived by himself in the boarding house. 

57The offender, who is of Sri Lankan descent, came to Australia when he was about three to fours year old. The Department of Community Services (DOCS) became involved with his family following allegations of acts of domestic violence by his father. The offender witnessed domestic violence at home. He also reported that his father used excessive physical punishment. In 2001, when the offender was 10 years old, his father murdered his mother. The offender and his brother were in the family home when their mother died. The offender's father is currently serving a prison term. 

58Following their mother's death, the offender and his brother came under the 'parental responsibility' of DOCS, who placed them with a family at Chester Hill. The placement broke down in 2005 reportedly due to the offender's difficult behaviours. He subsequently resided at several crisis and medium term placements. He engaged in binge drinking, used cannabis and had some experience with petrol sniffing. 

59The offender was educated to Year 9 level. Attempts to engage him to attend to Year 9 studies were unsuccessful. In September 2008 he was referred to the Marist Post-Release Support Service in an attempt to encourage participation in employment or training in the community. However, the offender refused to participate in any work experience training. I take into account the offender's difficult personal background. 

60An issue that was raised during the proceedings was whether the offender suffers from a mental disorder. An offender's mental condition can have the effect of reducing a person's moral culpability and matters such as specific and general deterrence, retribution and denunciation may have less weight. It may also mean that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on an offender. Conversely, the offender may present more of a danger to the community: Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 79 NSWLR at [177].

61Dr Kenneth Nunn, a psychiatrist, who interviewed the offender in 2007 and 2008 was required for cross-examination by Mr Steel. The Crown also called Dr Yvonne Skinner, a psychiatrist, whose report dated 18 April 2013 is ex A T19. Dr Skinner has not seen or examined the offender, as the offender had declined to be assessed by Dr Skinner or any other psychiatrist on behalf of the Crown despite requests being made by Rossi Kotsis, a solicitor employed in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.

62In a report dated 6 March 2008 (ex A T14), Dr Nunn expressed the opinion that the offender did not meet current DSMIV-R criteria for a psychiatric condition with the exception of conduct disorder. He explained that in reality, conduct disorder is a descriptive disorder and had no explanatory value in relation to why the offender might be acting as he did and what process underlies his behaviours. He reported that the offender had suffered ""both before and as a result of the death of his mother, with traumas that are sufficient to trouble most young people and is disordered in his psychological function, so that his mental life and social function are significantly impaired"" (ex A T14 p6). He opined that the offender was highly vulnerable to the development of a psychiatric disorder, but that there was no convincing evidence that the offender was suffering from any acute mental illness. 

63Dr Nunn's report had been compiled at the request of the Children's Court in relation to the charges of arson and malicious damage to property for which he was to be sentenced on 12 March 2008. 

64During his evidence, in answer to a question from Mr Crown as to whether the offender suffers from a mental illness, Dr Nunn replied (TOS 29/04/13 T9 L25-32): 

""...
A. My view is he does, but his illness, I have to say, that he, because it's largely trauma based, and not intrinsic psychosis, it would have to be argued. It's even being argued in the DSM, they are just about to release a new classification with developmental trauma disorder as a major new diagnosis to capture this situation. But it still remains problematic because people are much more comfortable about saying schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder extreme, rather than extreme chronic complex posttraumatic stress disorder."" 

65Dr Nunn was of the opinion that the offender's traumatic background had produced a post-traumatic stress disorder. He thought that the offender had ""paranoid non-disclosure"" which was a symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder. 

66In re-examination by Mr Crown, Dr Nunn agreed ""that not one of [his] colleagues was convinced [of his] view"" (TOS 29/04/13 T20 L22-26). Dr Nunn was also aware from a review of the Justice Health file that since the offender had been in custody, he had been reviewed by numerous psychiatrists and other health workers and none of them had seen evidence of a mental illness or a mental disorder. 

67In preparing her report, the material that Dr Skinner reviewed included documents from Justice Health and extracts of documents produced by Juvenile Justice, Corrective Services and Marist Youth Care. It is unnecessary to mention all of the psychiatric and psychological assessments that have been made of the offender that are detailed in Dr Skinner's report, but I propose to refer to some of them. 

68Dr Skinner noted that Dr Shanna, a psychiatric registrar, saw the offender on 18 November 2007 when he had been charged with setting fire at the Marist Youth Refuge. Dr Shanna found no evidence of psychosis or other psychiatric disorder. The offender was reviewed by Dr Kasinathan, a psychiatrist, who found no evidence of psychosis or other psychiatric disorder. Dr Kasinathan continued to monitor the offender and interviewed him at the Baxter Detention Centre on 18 March 2009, but he found no evidence of psychiatric disorder, mood disorder or psychosis. 

69Dr Skinner reviewed the clinical records of Dr Adam Martin, a psychiatrist, who saw the offender in October 2008. She noted that the offender denied any symptoms of anxiety and depression and Dr Martin found no suggestion of psychosis. 

70On 15 November 2011, the offender was assessed after an incident at Parklea Prison in which he threw a television at a cellmate and set fire in the cell. He reportedly said that he had been hearing voices telling him to throw the TV and set fire to the cell. The psychiatrist found no evidence of mental illness and thought that he was seeking a single cell placement. The psychiatrist noted anti-social and narcissistic elements of his personality and recommended psychological assessment. On 23 November 2011, the offender told a psychologist that he had no mental health issues or concerns, and no thoughts of harm to self or others. On 23 April 2012 a mental health nurse assessed the offender and found no evidence of mood disorder or psychosis. In July 2012, the offender told a psychologist that he had never been close to anyone. He also said that he felt like his crime was committed by someone else. Dr Skinner noted that no perceptual disturbances or psychotic phenomena were evident. The offender was not on any prescribed medication. His mood state was normal. He denied any suicidal ideas, thoughts of self-harm or plans. His insight and judgment appeared to be intact. 

71Dr Skinner observed that except for a brief period in 2011 when a doctor prescribed a low dose of major tranquilliser, no psychotropic medications have been prescribed for the offender. 

72The review undertaken by Dr Skinner included extensive consideration of Dr Nunn's reports. Dr Skinner had also considered the ERISP interviews, DVD's, transcripts and CCTV footage. Dr Skinner concluded that she was unable ""to find any signs of mental illness or any documented evidence that there has been any evidence of mental illness in the past"" (ex A T19 p14). She remarked that since Dr Nunn's assessment in 2008, there have been no signs of psychosis or mental disorder. 

73Dr Skinner states (ex A T19 p15): 

""[The offender] has been assessed and reviewed frequently in prison and ...no diagnosis of psychiatric disorder has been made. No psychotropic medications have been prescribed, except for low dose tranquillising medication in late 2011. 

I can find no evidence that [the offender] is suffering from a mental illness"".

74Dr Skinner was cross-examined by Mr Steel on Juvenile Justice notes made by Sugi Heng in 2008 which included an entry that ""Dr Martin further summarised [the offender's] diagnosis per consultation with Dr Claire Gaskin, director of Justice Health: that [the offender] may be suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder with brief psychotic episodes"" (ex 1 T1) and an entry made by June Wong in counselling on 26 November 2007 that it appeared that the offender was experiencing ""flash backs"" (ex 1 T2). Dr Skinner did not accept that what was referred to in Ms Wong's notes was symptomatic of post traumatic stress disorder; but suggested that the offender was ""really talking about memories of things that have happened"" (TOS 29/04/13 T31 L10). When cross-examined on the features of paranoia that Ms Heng had recorded in case notes dated 9 November 2007, Dr Skinner did not agree that the paranoid features could be features of post-traumatic stress disorder, but considered that ""it is a feature of problems he had with authority and lack of secure intentions"" (TOS 29/04/13 T32 L5-9). 

75In further cross-examination on Justice Health progress notes dated 23 November 2007, Dr Skinner agreed that based on that material and Dr Nunn's assessment, a reasonable diagnosis was that the offender might have been suffering from post traumatic stress disorder, but she said that the offender had been seen ""by some very competent psychiatrists within the prison system so [she] would be happy to rely on their assessments"" (TOS 29/04/13 T40 L12-14).

76Mr Steel did not submit that the offender has a mental illness. His contention was that the offender suffers from a chronic complex post-traumatic stress disorder. Mr Crown argued that there was no evidence to support the offender's contention that he was suffering from a mental disorder at the time of the commission of the offences. 

77Dr Skinner's careful consideration of the psychiatric and psychological assessments discloses that since 2008, no other psychiatrist or psychologist has assessed the offender as suffering from a mental illness or mental disorder. Dr Nunn's diagnosis of a chronic complex post-traumatic stress disorder is not supported by recent psychiatric opinions and is founded upon interviews with the offender in 2007 and 2008. He has not interviewed the offender since 2008. I prefer and accept Dr Skinner's assessment that the offender neither has a mental illness nor a mental disorder. I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offender had in March 2011 or presently has a chronic complex post-traumatic stress disorder. 

78Remorse as a mitigating factor is qualified by s 21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which requires the offender to provide evidence that he has accepted responsibility for his actions and has acknowledged any injury, loss, or damage caused by them. By his pleas of guilty, the offender has accepted responsibility for his offending. However, I am not satisfied that his pleas are indications of his contrition or remorse, rather they are a recognition of the high strength of the Crown case against him. 

79Dr Skinner records in her report that during an assessment by a mental health nurse on 23 April 2012, the offender asked the nurse if the discussion was confidential. When told that the file might be subpoenaed, the offender immediately stated, ""I feel remorse"" (ex A T19 p5). I do not find that this expression of remorse was genuine, but agree with Dr Skinner's assessment that the offender felt that his statement might assist him on sentence. Dr Skinner was of the view that the offender ""has shown no capacity for empathy and no signs of remorse"" (ex A T19 p13). 

80The telephone calls made by the offender from prison and the Justice Health records do not indicate regret by the offender for the grave harm that he has caused. There is nothing, in my view, that establishes that the offender is remorseful and has acknowledged the injury and loss caused by his offending. I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offender is contrite or remorseful. His sentence is not to be increased for that, but no allowance in mitigation can be made for remorse or contrition. 

81Mr Crown invited me to find that the offender has no prospects of rehabilitation and there is a high likelihood of re-offending by his committing serious sexual assaults and murder. On the other hand, Mr Steel pointed to the offender's youth and submitted that there are greater prospects of rehabilitation from that fact alone and the prediction of an offender's conduct is notoriously difficult. 

82I should mention that the commission of the offences was not in any way brought about by youthful impulsiveness or immaturity. I do not assess the offender's criminality to be less than that in the case of a mature adult: R v Hearne [2001] NSWCCA 37; (2001) 124 A Crim R 451. 

83In his report (ex A T14), Dr Nunn considered that the offender represented a high risk of violent re-offending, but was likely to show improvement in a stable environment in detention with therapy from an experienced clinician under the supervision of a child psychiatrist. 

84During his oral testimony, Dr Nunn recommended that a compulsory treatment order be taken out through the Mental Health Review Tribunal. He suggested regular intra muscular therapy with antipsychotics. Dr Nunn said (TOS 29/4/13 T21 L30-35): 

""So I'm really holding to the same position that I held when I said that I thought he was very dangerous in the first place, but that he has a modest possibility of response to treatment, and in his case the possibility that some use of drugs that are so-called anti-psychotics would reduce his dangerousness to other inmates, to other staff member and to himself and to his level of distress..."" 

85Dr Skinner, who had been a member of the Mental Health Review Tribunal for 11 years, did not believe that the offender was a suitable candidate for a compulsory treatment order as he lacked the ability to engage in any kind of therapy. She referred to the offender's exposure as a young person to psychologists, psychiatrists, counsellors and other persons who offered him treatment, but at no stage was he able to engage or ask for any form of therapy. Dr Skinner opined that the Mental Health Review Tribunal is usually against coercive therapy, but would rather hope that the person might show some motivation to seek therapy. 

86Dr Skinner considered that the offender presented a high risk of future dangerousness. Important contributors to the risk included his history of offending, his total pre-occupation with the crime as shown by the computer records, the total pre-occupation with fantasies involving killing and sexual themes, his inability to make close friends, and lack of empathy. Dr Skinner thought that it was of particular concern that the offender had spent most of, if not all his leisure time planning about committing offences. She could not recall ever in the past making an assessment of high risk of future dangerousness. Dr Skinner accepted that the offender's risk of re-offending may diminish over a lengthy period in custody. 

87In my view, another matter that points to the risk of future dangerousness is the visiting of various websites and articles, that included ""Beginnings of a Serial Killer"", by the offender on the night of the murder.

88I consider that the offender's prospects of rehabilitation are very poor. His Juvenile Justice records are replete with resistance to any form of counselling and assistance. He has demonstrated a lack of ability to engage in any kind of therapy and has shown no capacity for empathy or signs of remorse. However, I am unable to find with certainty that the offender has no prospects of rehabilitation as the offender is 21 years old and it remains possible that he might develop some insight into his offending as he grows older in custody. 

89A finding of future dangerousness does not need to be established beyond reasonable doubt: R v SLD [2003] NSWCCA 310; (2003) 58 NSWLR 589. It is sufficient if the Crown establishes that there is a risk of re-offending: R v Harrison (1997) 93 A Crim R 314. Both psychiatrists considered that the offender represents a high risk of violent re-offending. It appears unlikely from Dr Skinner's experience with the Mental Health Review Tribunal that coercive therapy will be imposed. In any event, Dr Nunn thought that there was only a ""modest possibility"" that regular intra muscular therapy would reduce the offender's dangerousness. I am satisfied that there is a real risk that the offender will re-offend by committing serious offences of violence and sexual assault and the risk will probably remain until it is moderated naturally with advanced age. I do not make this finding lightly, but the evidence in this case compels such a conclusion. I acknowledge, however, that there is a difficulty in predicting future dangerousness so far into the future. 

90I am conscious that a sentence otherwise appropriate to the seriousness of an offence cannot be extended merely to protect society. On the other hand, the court must have regard to the protection of society as a factor in determining a proportionate sentence. In Veen v The Queen (No 2), the majority (Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ) said at 474:

""...It must be acknowledged, however, that the practical observance of a distinction between extending a sentence merely to protect society and properly looking to society's protection in determining the sentence calls for a judgment of experience and discernment"". 

91The Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Robinson [2002] NSWCCA 359 observed at [41]: 

""That judgment is necessarily founded on a finding as to the offender's future conduct"". 

92Mr Steel submits that the offender's pleas of guilty were entered in the Local Court and should be treated as being at the earliest opportunity. On the other hand, Mr Crown contends that neither plea was at the first available opportunity and points out that the plea to the aggravated sexual assault was not entered until some 20 months after the offence. 

93The Crown's brief of evidence was complete on 7 February 2012. The offender's solicitor advised the Crown on 21 February 2012 that all charges would be defended. Later that day, the Crown wrote to the solicitor for the offender reiterating the strength of the Crown case and indicated that the Crown would consent to an adjournment if counsel was to be engaged. Adjournments were then sought by the offender. On 5 April 2012, counsel for the offender advised the Crown that the offender would be pleading guilty to the murder, subject to psychiatric assessments. The plea of guilty to murder was entered on 16 July 2012. 

94The plea of guilty to a single offence of aggravated sexual assault was entered on 21 November 2012. It followed representations seeking the withdrawal of the charge. A willingness to have an additional uncharged aggravated sexual assault dealt with on a Form 1 was indicated on the same date. 

95A discount for the utilitarian value of a plea is determined largely by the timing of the plea: R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; (2009) 195 A Crim R 1. Although I am not satisfied that either plea was entered at the first available opportunity, the pleas were entered in the Local Court and have utilitarian value. As the pleas were entered at different times, it would normally be necessary to assess their utilitarian value separately. The utilitarian value of the pleas, in the normal course of events, would, in my view, result in a sentencing discount of between 15 and 20 per cent. However, in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, Spigelman CJ observed at [157] that:

""There are circumstances in which the protection of the public requires a long sentence to be imposed so that no discount for the plea is appropriate"".

96In my view, the grave circumstances of the offences and the high danger that the offender represents to society do not justify any utilitarian discount being applied to the sentences. 

97The maximum sentence for the crime of murder is imprisonment for life. A person sentenced to imprisonment for life is to serve that sentence for the term of his natural life: s 19A(2) Crimes Act 1900. Section 19A(3) provides that nothing in s 19A affects the operation of s 21(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (which authorises the passing of a lesser sentence than imprisonment for life). 

98Section 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is as follows: 

""A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence"". 

99Section 61(6) provides that ""[t]his section does not apply to a person who was less than 18 years of age at the date of the commission of the offence"". 

100The maximum penalty of life imprisonment is intended for cases falling within the worst category of murder: Ibbs v The Queen [1987] HCA 46; (1987) 163 CLR 447 at 451-452; 27 A Crim R 465 at 468. The level of culpability of the offender in the commission of the offence and whether the case is one calling for a life sentence in the terms of s 61(1), is first to be considered, and if so, whether in the exercise of the discretion conferred by s 21(1), the subjective features relating to the offender justify a lesser sentence of imprisonment for a specified term: R v Harris [2000] NSWCCA 469; (2000) 50 NSWLR 409, R v Phuong Canh Ngo (No 3) [2001] NSWSC 1021; (2001) 125 A Crim R 495. The primary focus of s 61(1) is an assessment of how extreme the offender's culpability is: R v Merritt [2004] NSWCCA 19; (2004) 59 NSWLR 557 at [52]. The combined effect of the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection, and deterrence is critical to a conclusion that a life sentence is required. The absence of any one or more of the four indicia may make it more difficult for the conclusion to be reached that a life sentence is required, but will not be determinative: Knight v R [2006] NSWCCA 292; (2006) 164 A Crim R 126 at [23]. 

101Mr Crown submitted that a life sentence was justified in the present case and drew my attention to what were said to be comparable cases. Whilst I found the cases from New South Wales to be helpful, each case depends on its own facts. 

102Mr Steel referred to the offender being in custody since the age of 19 years and given the usual life expectancy of a male, the practical effect of a life sentence would be a sentence in excess of 50 years. 

103The current median life expectancy for an Australian male is 79 years. The imposition of a life sentence could mean that the offender will serve 60 years or more in prison if a life sentence is imposed. The offender's youth and the difficulty with the long range forecasting of future dangerousness militate against an indeterminate sentence. I do not consider that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection, and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of such a long sentence. Nevertheless, in the circumstances of this case, the sentence must be a very long one. 

104Victim impact statements of Sunil Thakkar and Liese Thakkar, the deceased's parents and Vishang Thakkar, the deceased's brother were read to the court. The contents of the statements cannot be used by me to increase the offender's sentence: R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76. I acknowledge the grief and distress of the deceased's family and express on the community's behalf its sympathy and compassion for them. 

105In structuring the sentences to be imposed, I have fixed an appropriate sentence for each offence and then considered questions of cumulation or concurrence as well as totality. It seems to me that the only way to avoid double counting is to make the sentences concurrent. I consider that the sentence to be imposed for murder can comprehend and reflect the criminality of the aggravated sexual assault including the offence on the Form 1. 

106Mr Steel submitted that special circumstances should be found so as to warrant the reduction of the non-parole period below the statutory ratio. He referred to R v Robinson at [71]-[72] and to findings of special circumstances that had been made by the Court of Criminal Appeal in that case. Mr Steel contended that [like Robinson's case] the offender's youth at the time of the offence, the difficulty of predicting the future, the fact that the head sentence will be lengthy and that release on parole will not be automatic but is likely to depend on the offender's rehabilitation are all matters on which a finding of special circumstances would be appropriate. 

107I have already taken into account the offender's youth and the difficulty in predicting the future in deciding that a determinate sentence is appropriate. In R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 Spigelman CJ said at [18] that ""double counting"" for matters already taken into account in reducing a head sentence and therefore already reflected in the head sentence must be avoided. I do, however, find as a special circumstance that if the offender is found eligible for release on parole after a very long period of custody, there is the risk of institutionalisation and his rehabilitation will require lengthy post-release supervision: R v Lemene [2001] NSWCCA 5; (2001) 118 A Crim R 131; Jackson v R [2010] NSWCCA 162.

108The non-parole period that I am about to set is the minimum period required to reflect the grave circumstances of the murder and the protection of society. The agreed date for the commencement of the sentences is 11 March 2011.

109Daniel Stani-Reginald for the murder of Tosha Thakkar, I convict you. I sentence you to a term of 45 years imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 30 years which is to commence on 11 March 2011 and is to expire on 10 March 2041 with a balance of term of 15 years which is to commence on 11 March 2041 and will expire on 10 March 2056. 

110Daniel Stani-Reginald for the aggravated sexual assault of Tosha Thakkar (including the offence on the Form 1), I convict you. I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of 15 years consisting of a non-parole period of 10 years which is to commence on 11 March 2011 and is to expire on 10 March 2021 with a balance of term of 5 years which is to commence on 11 March 2021 and will expire on 10 March 2026. 

111The earliest date that you will be eligible to be released on parole is 10 March 2041. 

112I ask Mr Steel to advise the offender of the existence of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 and of its application to the offences for which he has been sentenced.

2706736,Saed Al-Marzouq v R [2013] NSWCCA 112,"Judgment

1SIMPSON J: I agree with Harrison J.

2HARRISON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed by Freeman DCJ on 10 June 2011 at Sydney. The applicant came before his Honour for sentence in relation to a total of eighteen dishonesty and break and enter offences committed over a period of approximately six weeks and while the applicant was on parole. He had earlier pleaded guilty to all matters in the Local Court on 4 April 2011. Eight of the offences were on court attendance notices and the remainder were listed on two Forms 1.

3The applicant was sentenced to an effective non-parole period of 3 years and 3 months and an overall effective head sentence of 6 years. The ratio of the non-parole period to the head sentence was 54.2 percent. His Honour gave the applicant a combined discount of 50 percent for his early plea and for assistance, so that the overall starting point for the sentence was 12 years. Although the applicant originally sought leave to appeal on two grounds, that was restricted at the hearing in this Court to the single ground, namely, that the sentences both individually and in combination were manifestly excessive.

4The applicant was sentenced upon the basis of the following facts.

5At about 7.45pm on 4 August 2010, two unknown males robbed a man, stealing his wallet. Approximately one hour later, the applicant possessed two credit cards from the wallet. That formed the basis for the charge of receiving stolen property. The applicant was sentenced for this offence to a term of 2 years with a non-parole period of 18 months.

6At 8.50pm on the same day, the applicant and a young person attempted to use one of the credit cards at a petrol station to purchase a packet of cigarettes and a $30 Vodafone recharge. They were questioned by the service station attendant who took the card. They later left without the items but the transaction, valued at $47.45, was approved by EFTPOS. That formed the basis for the offence of attempt to dishonestly obtain financial advantage by deception listed on a Form 1. Later, at about 9.17pm, the applicant and the young person went to a convenience store and used the other credit card on two transactions of $24.20 and $30. They formed the basis for two offences of dishonestly obtain financial advantage by deception listed on a Form 1.

7Then at about 9.35pm the applicant and the young person used the credit card at a service station to purchase items totalling $54.38. That formed the basis of the charge of dishonestly obtaining financial advantage by deception. The applicant was sentenced for this offence to a term of 16 months with a non-parole period of 12 months. Shortly thereafter the applicant used the credit card to pay a taxi fare of $13.94. That formed the basis of a further charge of dishonestly obtaining financial advantage by deception. The applicant was sentenced for this offence to a term of 16 months with a non-parole period of 12 months.

8On 10 August 2010 the applicant and another young person went to premises in Rodd Street, Birrong. They there forced open a window and entered the premises. The alarm was activated and they left. No property was taken. The applicant's fingerprints were found at the premises. That formed the basis of the offence of aggravated break and enter with intent to steal in company. The applicant was sentenced for this offence to a term of 3 years with a non-parole period of 18 months.

9On 5 August 2010 the applicant entered the rear yard of unit premises in Renown Avenue, Wiley Park by forcing a side gate while in company with two juveniles. They then used tools found at the premises to smash a hole in the rear door and gain access. They entered several rooms of the unit and ransacked it, leaving items scattered on the floor. No property was stolen. Fingerprints found matched those of the applicant. These facts formed the basis of an offence of aggravated break and enter a dwelling house with intent to steal listed on a Form 1.

10On 9 August 2010 the applicant entered a house in Rose Street, Sefton by forcing open a window. He entered several rooms and ransacked the premises leaving items scattered on the floor. A bottle of soft drink and biscuits were consumed by the applicant whilst there. Numerous items to the value of $2,750 were stolen. The applicant's palm print was found at the scene. These facts formed the basis of an offence of break, enter and steal listed on a Form 1.

11On the following day the applicant removed a flyscreen from a window attempting to gain access to premises by forcing a lock. He also smashed a window in his attempt and reached through the opening. No property was stolen. The applicant's fingerprints were found at the scene. These facts formed the basis of an offence of break and enter a dwelling house with intent to steal listed on a Form 1.

12Between 10 and 11 August 2010 the applicant entered the rear yard and attempted to gain entry to premises in Allum Street, Bankstown by removing a lock on the door and attempting to force it open. No property was taken. The door, the doorframe and the lock were damaged. Fingerprints matching those of the applicant were found at the scene. These facts formed the basis of an offence of attempted break and enter a dwelling house with intent to steal listed on a Form 1.

13On 24 August 2010 the applicant was found in possession of 1.7g of marijuana, a pair of scissors and a bong. He provided a false name to the police. These facts formed the basis of an offence of possess prohibited drug and state false name to police listed on a Form 1.

14On 15 September 2010 the applicant entered premises in Fairview Avenue, Roselands. He switched off the power, jumped a gate into the backyard and smashed a window using a brick. Upon entering the premises the alarm was activated and he left. No property was stolen. Fingerprints found at the scene matched those of the applicant. These facts formed the basis of an offence of break and enter a dwelling house with intent to steal listed on a Form 1.

15On 20 August 2010 the applicant entered premises in Ewen Street, Roselands in company by forcing open a side gate. The offenders entered removed and smashed a perspex and glass louvre on a window through which they gained access to several rooms. They ransacked the premises stealing numerous items to the value of $6,760. The applicant's fingerprints were once again found at the scene. That formed the basis of the offence of aggravated break, enter and steal in company. The applicant was sentenced for this offence to a term of 3 years with a non-parole period of 18 months.

16At about 8.00pm on 5 September 2010 the applicant, in company with the same offenders and one other, entered premises in Clio Street, Wiley Park. They initially knocked on the door but when there was no response, the applicant removed some fence palings to get into the backyard. He then removed the flyscreen and smashed part of the bathroom window. The applicant and the others all entered through the window and ransacked the house stealing numerous items including national service medals and World War II badges to the value of $400. The applicant's fingerprints were once again located at the scene. That formed the basis of the offence of aggravated break, enter and steal. The applicant was sentenced for this offence to a term of 3 years with a non-parole period of 18 months.

17On the following day the applicant smashed a window of a unit in Ferguson Avenue, Wiley Park while in company. He and his accomplice climbed in and entered several rooms. They ransacked the premises, stealing numerous items to the value of $4,869. The applicant's fingerprints were found at the scene. That formed the basis of the offence of aggravated break, enter and steal. The applicant was sentenced for this offence to a term of 3 years with a non-parole period of 3 months.

18Finally, on 14 September 2010 the applicant in company with others unknown entered a unit in Leylands Parade, Belmore. One person initially obtained entry through a partially opened window. That person then left the unit and opened the front security door to give access to the others. They entered several rooms and ransacked the premises stealing numerous items to the value of $15,700. Fingerprints matching those of the applicant were found. That formed the basis of the offence of aggravated steal in dwelling house and break out. The applicant was sentenced for this offence to a term of 3 years with a non-parole period of 18 months.

Subjective circumstances

19The applicant was born in August 1990 and so was aged between 19 and 20 years of age at the time of the commission of the offences. He is the youngest of seven children. His father died when he was 2 years old and his mother died when he was 12 years old. He described the death of his mother as a turning point in his life towards misconduct.

20The learned sentencing judge described, and accepted, the reason for the applicant's offending to be his concern to pay a debt of $8,000 to people who he said had captured him and threatened violence to him and his family. His Honour described this situation as follows:

""He says at the stage of which he began this series of criminal offences, he owed some $8,000 to his associates; that he had been captured by them and threatened with a bat to his head with the promise of further violence to himself and, worryingly, to his family, including his five year old nephew, so that he felt himself driven to attempt to pay this outstanding sum by the deadline set by his tormentors and that he saw as the only opportunity of doing this, the commission of various offences such as I have described.""

21His Honour then proceeded to evaluate this predicament in the context of the applicant's relevant personal circumstances:

""This does not amount, of course, to a defence of duress, but it does give some indication of the motivation of this young man who because of his youth, because of the difficult and dysfunctional upbringing, because of his drug addled approach, seems to me to be worthy of some understanding, although his use of drugs does not by itself excuse his offending. Nonetheless, he is a very troubled young man who appears, I must say, to now have begun to appreciate the seriousness of his criminal conduct, to understand its impact upon his victims and to have set his face firmly in favour of rehabilitating himself. He has now not been using drugs whilst in custody. I note that he is, because of his history of escaping, kept in maximum security so that too is a factor to be borne in mind in setting the term of his imprisonment.""

22It is clear that his Honour accepted that the applicant had quite good prospects of rehabilitation because of his youth and his developing insight. He was found to be empathetic with his victims and to be taking steps to enrol in self-improvement programmes within the prison system.

23It was contended for the applicant in this Court that his Honour had erred in choosing a notional starting point for each individual sentence that was too high and which resulted in sentences that were manifestly excessive. The same criticism correspondingly applied to the total effective sentence of 12 years.

24Counsel for the applicant submitted that his Honour made no attempt to assess the criminality of any of the offences apart from the two offences of dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage, which his Honour characterised as falling at ""the lower end of seriousness"". His Honour allegedly made no attempt to determine whether any individual offence was more or less serious than any other or others. All aggravated break and enter offences received the same sentence. Two counts of dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage, involving in all a total of less than $70, nevertheless attracted sentences of 16 months.

25The ultimate burden of the applicant's submissions in this Court was that the total effective sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust. Particularly was that said to be so when regard is had to the objective seriousness of each individual offence in the context of the favourable subjective factors to which his Honour referred.

Consideration

26The applicant's criminal behaviour relevantly spanned a period of just six weeks. The monetary value of his crimes was small, although the impact upon his victims, particularly those whose homes were entered and ransacked, could not be similarly described. Even so, the level of offending involved in this short-lived spree of criminal behaviour was at the lower end of the scale. His Honour said as much with respect to some of the offences. His Honour offered no detailed assessment of the balance.

27There seems in my opinion to be a degree of tension between the very favourable, and on one view generous, assessment by his Honour of the applicant's subjective circumstances, including those concerned with his motivation for offending and his prospects of rehabilitation on the one hand, and the length of the sentences actually imposed by his Honour on the other hand. The starting point of 12 years for this combination of offences seems to me to be entirely, or at least significantly, at odds with that assessment, and with a reasonable view of the seriousness of the applicant's total offending. But for the combined discount of 50 percent for his plea and his offer to provide assistance, the applicant's effective non-parole period would have been substantially longer than the 3 years and 3 months ultimately imposed upon him. I find such a sentence to be difficult to reconcile with a generally low level of criminal activity committed over a short period of time by a young offender with the applicant's favourable subjective features and prospects of rehabilitation.

28The applicant has a history of difficulties with anger management. The psychiatric evidence from Dr Furst tendered on his behalf at the sentencing proceedings recommended that the applicant be placed under the care of a psychiatrist working for Justice Health to monitor his mental state and treatment needs. Dr Furst also recommended that the applicant should be referred to a clinical psychologist working within the Department of Corrective Services to deal with his previous childhood maladjustment and his ability to cope with stress without abusing drugs or resorting to anger. His Honour's imposition of a relatively long parole period would appear clearly and appropriately to have been directed at the need to provide the applicant with similar post-release medical care and supervision. I consider that the applicant should similarly remain subject to an extended period on parole.

29I consider that the overall sentence imposed upon the applicant was manifestly excessive. A lesser sentence is warranted. A diagrammatic representation of the sentences I propose is as follows:


30In the circumstances I consider that the following orders should be made:

1. Grant leave to appeal.

2. Set aside the sentences imposed by Freeman DCJ on 10 June 2011.

3. In lieu of those sentences, the applicant is sentenced as follows:

(a) On the count of receiving on 4 August 2010, and taking into account the items on the Form 1, sentenced to a non-parole period of 12 months commencing on 10 February 2011 expiring on 9 February 2012 with a balance of term of 6 months commencing on 10 February 2012 expiring on 9 August 2012.

(b) On the first count of dishonestly obtain financial advantage by deception on 4 August 2010, sentenced to a non-parole period of 6 months commencing on 10 April 2011 expiring on 9 October 2011 with a balance of term of 3 months commencing on 10 October 2011 expiring on 9 January 2012.

(c) On the second count of dishonestly obtain financial advantage by deception on 4 August 2010, sentenced to a non-parole period of 6 months commencing on 10 April 2011 expiring on 9 October 2011 with a balance of term of 3 months commencing on 10 October 2011 expiring on 9 January 2012.

(d) On the count of aggravated break and enter with intent to commit a serious indictable offence on 10 August 2010, and taking into account the items on the Form 1, sentenced to a non-parole period of 12 months commencing on 10 June 2011 expiring on 9 June 2012 with a balance of term of 6 months commencing on 10 June 2012 expiring on 9 December 2012.

(e) On the count of aggravated break, enter and steal in company on 20 August 2010, sentenced to a non-parole period of 12 months commencing on 10 September 2011 expiring on 9 September 2012 with a balance of term of 6 months commencing on 10 September 2012 expiring on 9 March 2013.

(f) On the count of aggravated break, enter and steal on 5 September 2010, sentenced to a non-parole period of 12 months commencing on 10 December 2011 expiring on 9 December 2012 with a balance of term of 6 months commencing on 10 December 2012 expiring on 9 June 2013.

(g) On the count of aggravated break, enter and steal on 6 September 2010, sentenced to a non-parole period of 12 months commencing on 10 March 2012 expiring on 9 March 2013 with a balance of term of 6 months commencing on 10 March 2013 expiring on 9 September 2013.

(h) On the count of aggravated steal in dwelling house and break out on 14 September 2010, sentenced to a non-parole period of 12 months commencing on 10 June 2012 expiring on 9 June 2013 with a balance of term of 12 months commencing on 10 June 2013 expiring on 9 June 2014. 

31This results in an overall head sentence of 3 years and 4 months and an effective non-parole period of 2 years and 4 months. The earliest day upon which the applicant will become entitled to be released on parole is 10 June 2013.

32BUTTON J: I agree with Harrison J.

2706741,Paul Darcey Armstrong v R [2013] NSWCCA 113,"Judgment

1SIMPSON J: I agree with Harrison J.

2HARRISON J: The appellant was found guilty on 15 April 2010, following a trial before Buddin J and a jury, of the murder of Filipe Flores at Woolloomooloo on 2 September 1991. He was sentenced on 12 August 2010 to a term of imprisonment of 17 years with a non-parole period of 11 years. There is no application for leave to appeal against that sentence.

3The appellant relies upon four grounds of appeal. They are as follows:

Ground 1: The trial judge erred in:

(a) admitting evidence, over objection, of the appellant's statements to his father in an intercepted telephone call from gaol, and

(b) in the failure to direct the jury, in respect of the Crown's submissions, in accordance with Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193.

Ground 2: The trial judge's directions in respect of the Crown's submissions as to consciousness of guilt were generally inadequate giving rise to a miscarriage of justice.

Ground 3: The evidence of the Crown expert Dr Bruce concerning the presence of blood under the deceased's fingernails and the use that was made of that evidence by the Crown, has given rise to a miscarriage of justice.

Ground 4: The Crown Prosecutor's conduct in her address gave rise to a miscarriage of justice.

4In my opinion the appeal should be allowed, the conviction should be quashed and a new trial ordered. This is for the following reasons.

Background

5Robert Small, a security guard, found the deceased in the early hours of 2 September 1991, in a deserted area behind an electricity sub-station west of Lincoln Crescent at Woolloomooloo. The deceased was aged 27 years and had been beaten to death. He was lying on his back with his trousers and underwear pulled down around his ankles. He had sustained injuries to his face and head and also to his genitals.

6The appellant was charged in relation to the matter in 2008 after DNA evidence linked him to genetic material found on the deceased. The appellant denied any involvement in the events giving rise to the death and it was the defence theory, explored at trial, that the deceased had been the victim of a ""gay bashing"" by unknown assailants. The appellant explained the DNA found upon the deceased as resulting from sexual contact between them earlier in the evening at the Exchange Hotel. There was evidence supporting the fact that attacks on gay men at the time of the killing were frequent in that area.

7Mr Small gave evidence that he was on patrol in the area on the night in question. He observed a truck parked in Lincoln Crescent at a time prior to his discovery of the deceased from which an occupant of the vehicle was heard to say words to the effect of ""do you think he's seen us."" Mr Small thought the voice sounded like that of a young male. The vehicle had arrived and positioned itself at a time and in a manner consistent with having possibly carried the deceased to the area and with the body being dumped there. The truck left the scene a few minutes after Mr Small heard a particular sound (referred to below), and the rattling of a cyclone wire security fence adjacent to where the truck was parked. Mr Small did not keep the vehicle under observation after he first observed it or up until the time that he discovered the deceased. It was the defence theory that there had been sufficient time for the occupants of the vehicle to have removed and dumped the deceased without being observed by Mr Small. There was no suggestion that the truck and the appellant were in any way connected.

8The deceased had been drinking with friends at the Exchange Hotel on the evening before his death. No one saw him leave. It was uncontroversial that he was intoxicated and emotional in the latter part of that evening.

9Renee Mock-Robertson was a friend of the deceased who gave evidence that he observed the deceased expressing a sexual interest in another man at the hotel. This was shortly before Mr Mock-Robertson had decided to go home. He was unable to estimate the precise time that he left the hotel, suggesting that it was about 3.00am although he was unsure. He agreed it was late.

10Shortly before leaving the hotel Mr Mock-Robertson saw the deceased talking to ""a massive guy"", who may well have been the appellant, as the defence conceded. The appellant is almost 201 cm tall. He thought that the deceased was going to ""go with this guy"" or ""stay with him"" or ""leave"" with him. This evidence strongly supported the appellant's suggestion that there had been a sexual encounter between him and the deceased at the Exchange Hotel. The appellant also said the same thing to the police when first interviewed. The expert and scientific evidence did not establish the conclusive source of the appellant's DNA and skin cells, semen and saliva could not be excluded as a likely source.

11Several years after the murder, forensic analysis linked the appellant's DNA profile with material located on the deceased's shirt and under his fingernails. The appellant was at that time living in Launceston. He submitted to an electronically recorded interview on 4 December 2008. He denied knowing the deceased when shown his photograph during the course of the interview. He did concede that he had been at the time in the habit of having sex with men in establishments such as the Exchange Hotel.

12The appellant was subsequently arrested, charged with the deceased's murder and extradited to New South Wales.

13It was the Crown case that the appellant drove the deceased from the hotel in his cream coloured station wagon with a pink offside door, bashed him to death and drove off. The Crown case was circumstantial. The evidential limbs in that case consisted of the following matters:

The presence of the appellant's DNA under the deceased's fingernails.
The alleged presence of blood under the deceased's fingernails.
Mr Small's evidence concerning one of the descriptions he gave of a vehicle (a light coloured station wagon) that he had seen leaving the area where the deceased was killed, which was said to bear some similarity to a vehicle owned by the appellant at the time. Another description of this vehicle given by Mr Small was inconsistent with the appellant's vehicle, inasmuch as it was described as a sedan. In both cases, Mr Small described the vehicle as having a pink or red (like a primer) coloured driver's side door. There was no evidence adduced that the appellant's vehicle ever had a pink door.
The demeanour of the appellant during the course of his electronically recorded interview, said to give rise to a consciousness of guilt.
An alleged lie told by the appellant when interviewed, concerning the ownership of a car at the time of the murder, which the Crown asserted went to consciousness of guilt.
The evidence of the appellant's former partner Ms Webber concerning her observations of the appellant 17 years previously after he allegedly claimed to have been in a fight with a hotel patron where he worked sometime in September 1991, and alleged admissions made to her after she showed him an image of the deceased in the Sydney Star Observer.
An alleged admission made by the appellant in a lawfully recorded telephone conversation with his father whilst in gaol on remand. The appellant made reference to not entering a plea until such time as the brief was served. This admission was not a confession but the conversation was said to contain representations inconsistent with innocence and consistent with a consciousness of guilt.

14The Crown case was that a possible motive for the attack was that the deceased had informed the appellant that he was HIV positive during or following a sexual encounter that provoked the appellant to violence. The Crown called John Goosens who gave evidence that he counselled the deceased very shortly before his death about the importance of engaging in safe sex and about the critical need for him to inform prospective sexual partners of his HIV status.

15The defence case at trial centred on evidence given by the appellant denying that he had killed the deceased or that he had even accompanied him to Woolloomooloo. The defence case was that although the appellant did not recall the deceased, he accepted the presence of his DNA and provided a possible explanation for it as the product of a possible sexual encounter with the deceased at the Exchange Hotel. It was the defence theory that sometime after this encounter the deceased was set upon by another or others, consistently with crimes of that type then common in the same area.

16The Crown maintained that the timing of the relevant surrounding events rendered this explanation implausible as the last sighting of the deceased was around 3.00am and his body was discovered no more than 30 minutes later some distance away. This was said to have been insufficient time for a physical encounter with the appellant at or near the hotel and his death at Woolloomooloo.

17It was not the defence case, however, that the sexual encounter with the deceased took place after he was last sighted at the hotel at about 3.00am. The evidence of Mr Mock-Robertson and Mr Ortiz-Finol supported the conclusion that the exchange with the appellant occurred some time much earlier. Mr Ortiz-Finol's evidence was that he had the deceased in his sight from 2.40am when the deceased went to an ATM and for the twenty minutes or so thereafter until he decided to walk the deceased home. Mr Ortiz-Finol approached his flatmate at this time to inform him that he was leaving and to let his friends know that he would be returning to the hotel. That conversation took no more than 60 to 90 seconds during which time the deceased disappeared.

18Mr Ortiz-Finol did not see any exchange between the deceased and a person fitting the description of the appellant, nor did he see Mr Mock-Robertson and the deceased engaged in any conversation consistent with Mr Mock-Robertson's description of the deceased. The evidence was consistent with the appellant and the deceased having a liaison earlier than 3.00am and with the deceased disappearing at a time and in circumstances not involving the appellant. There was said to be ample time for the deceased to have become the victim of an attack in his intoxicated and vulnerable condition when he became separated from his friend Mr Ortiz-Finol.

19The evidence established that the deceased disappeared close to 3.00am, although the evidence about this was imprecise. An ambulance arrived at the scene at 3.48am. A call from Mr Small to his office was logged at 3.44am. Mr Small said that it took the ambulance about ten minutes to arrive. It follows that the deceased was attacked or dumped sometime between 3.00am and 3.40am. The deceased was still alive when Mr Small first discovered him. 

20There was no evidence that the deceased left the hotel in the company of the appellant.

21Mr Small gave evidence that he had noticed a car with some kind of spotlight drive down Lincoln Crescent and turn and drive back and away. He saw someone getting into the vehicle with ""the red primer door"". That person was described as being 168cm to 173cm tall with fuzzy or curly hair like a lady's perm. Mr Small lost sight of both parked vehicles as he walked from Lincoln Crescent to the Woolloomooloo Hotel. The truck seen by Mr Small left ""a few to several minutes before the car left."" This meant on the Crown case theory that the truck must have been present when the deceased was attacked or dumped.

Grounds 3 and 4

22It is convenient to deal first with Grounds 3 and 4 together. In order to give substance to the appellant's submission, it is necessary to record the relevant portions of the Crown's address to the jury about which complaint is made. They are contained in so much of her address to the jury as follows:

""CROWN PROSECUTOR: Ladies and gentlemen, thank goodness Mr Robert Small decided to do his patrol at the time he did on the morning of 2 September 1991. Had he not discovered the body of Felipe Flores at that time, at about 3.30 or so, perhaps 3.35, in the position that it was, the area we all know, had he not discovered it then, had the body gone undiscovered until 5, 6 or 9 o'clock in the morning, the Crown would not be in such a strong position to submit to you that the accused was the killer of Felipe Flores.

...

And we have from Mr Small this very important evidence, really, about a car. Well, of course, there are a lot of early model Holden station wagons of a white or cream colour around but we have got this primer in the rear door. The evidence doesn't exactly say that this car had primer in the rear door but we have heard from a number of owners, we have got a different coloured door from the Skermans, we have got work being done by the Moore boys and we have got the evidence it was a piece of junk, a wreck, and things like that.

And Mr Small noticed that, as you know, that the headlights of the car were not put on by the person leaving that location. The Crown would submit to you that that was because the driver of that car had done something for which he did not wish to be identified, he didn't want his number plates illuminated, he drove off with the headlights and taillights off so that the person that he could see - he could see the night watchman, you might think, carrying the torch even though he was some distance away - keep those headlights off so that his car was not to be seen.

That was the murderer of Felipe Flores and the Crown submits to you, on the basis of the evidence, that it was this man, Paul Darcey Armstrong, the owner of the car, the car that he had forgot, the car he had said to police nothing about until they put it to him, it was Paul Darcey Armstrong who, in a similar vein to not turning on his headlights as he was leaving, didn't come walking out held up to his full 6 feet 7 when he saw that night watchman patrolling with a torch, he skulked back to that car so that the night watchman wouldn't be able to see from 80 or 90 metres away what his true height was. He's been 6 foot 7 since he was 16 years of age, he knows how conspicuous a man of his height is and how you can get into trouble, 'The big bloke did it'. He wasn't marching alone like a soldier marching along at his full height when he went back into that car, so Mr Small thought it was a man of about 5 foot 6 to 5 foot 8. It wasn't Clifford Lee though and of course I'll take you in some detail to that conversation with poor old Clifford Lee who perhaps may have been targeted because of the police grabbing on to this 5 foot 6, 5 foot 8 business that led to that red herring.

Of course, as we know, ladies and gentlemen, this crime was not solved and the Crown submits to you it was solved when the DNA under the fingernails of Felipe Flores - and I'll take you to Dr Bruce's evidence where it is suggested that at least some of that DNA is on the concave surface, that is the inside surfaces of the fingernails, wasn't solved until that DNA was found to be, and the accused concedes it, the DNA of the accused. There's no other DNA under the fingernails of Mr Flores, no third party at all, there's Mr Flores' own DNA and there's this man's DNA, Paul Darcey Armstrong, who had a par [sic] which extraordinarily matches, you might think, the description by Mr Small.

And we have this very tight time frame, we have a very tight time frame without which it could be suggested that Mr Flores had plenty of time to get down there, anyone could have done it, the car leaving at 3.20 or 3.20, whatever you take from Mr Small's evidence, had nothing to do with it, Mr Flores mightn't have got there for hours later but we have this very tight time frame. We have the car.

...

We have, ladies and gentlemen, the visit to the doctor by the accused on 3 September 1991, and follow-up visits, as you know, in February of the next year. That's one of the problems with cases that come to courts so much later than it happened, so many records are lost and destroyed, but we have these pieces of evidence fitting in together. 

We have then Jacinta Webber, formerly Stephan Webber, who came into this Court, you might think, and gave evidence to the best of her recollection honestly and truthfully. We have heard how Detective Senior Constable Hungerford finally found the person who was Stephan Webber. It took a while, or course, because not only had the name changed but of course the gender had changed. But we heard from Jacinta Webber that she had been in a relationship for a very convenient one year or so period, all in 1991. So she's not confused about the year that these things happened because she was only with him for one year, it didn't cross two years, it was always in one year, 1991.

...

You recall the evidence, and I'll take you to it in a little bit of detail later, but you would be satisfied, I am sure, that there was no suggestiveness by Detective Hungerford to Ms Webber about what she should say as to how the death occurred. There was no coercion, there was nothing improper in the way Detective Hungerford approached her and asked her in no improper way if she could remember anything from that year. 

And she told you, of course, that she remembers the accused coming home with scratch marks on his face, not a suspected broken nose and a laceration on the lip. And isn't it interesting that in relation to that 1991 injury that the accused suffered in June when two or three men set upon him, he doesn't even remember telling Stephan about that. He doesn't even know whether she was at home, she might have been away. She wasn't talking about that time.

Look at the diagram in the records from the St Vincent's Hospital. There's no scratch marks on that face, there's no scratch marks on the body. The accused came home with those scratch marks on 2 September 1991 and the shirt that Stephan Webber had given him that cost, Jacinta remembers now, $120, she remembers it clearly, she was annoyed, the shirt had been destroyed because it had blood on it and it had been torn, that shirt was thrown in the rubbish bin and that's why she remembers that occasion. But the parallel scratch marks centimetres long on the face and on the chest, that was the only defensive action that the unfortunate Mr Flores got the chance to do. He didn't get the chance to punch or fight or anything else, he was in close proximity, he scratched the accused in the last moments of his life.

The accused wasn't forthcoming to Jacinta about what had happened at that time. You can imagine, can't you, perhaps if you had done something dreadful, if you had killed someone and the police aren't yet knocking on your door, aren't yet chasing you, you're going to be very reticent about telling anyone, even the person with whom you're living, that you're going to try and get away with it and tough it out. And this wasn't a relationship where the accused told Stephan everything, he was unfaithful to him, he had his own secrets, he had his own social life. He didn't tell him everything, you might think, and he didn't tell him the truth about what had occasioned these scratch marks on the face and chest.

But several weeks later, you might think, when the heat's off a bit and this looks like just another unsolved gay homicide, the accused gets a bit more cocky about telling Stephan about what happened. He doesn't read newspapers but Stephan had the Sydney Star Observer, which comes out once a fortnight, and said, 'Another gay murder in Woolloomooloo' and the accused couldn't help himself - you know the accused well now, you know the type of man he is - he couldn't help but boast almost. He said, 'I hurt a man very badly down there that night but he was still alive when I left him'.

Another reason why we should be very grateful not just for the evidence of Mr Small but for the fact of Mr Small having done his patrol at the time he did. We know from Dr Schwartz that death with the dreadful internal injuries Mr Flores suffered would have been quick. But it was not necessarily instant. The blood had to be lost from the heart and spleen and liver, as the doctor explained, and Mr Small was very clear about his perception that the deceased's eyes, when he first saw him, had the appearance of some life in them, some pleading look in those eyes, some brightness, which soon was extinguished. The accused, when he beat, kicked and stomped the deceased, knew he was still alive when he left him and that's why he told Stephan, 'He was still alive when I left him' and Mr Small thought Mr Flores was still alive. How would Jacinta Webber make that up today?

...

Then, of course, we have the interview with the police which I'll take you to some parts of in due course, but you might think when you look at it - and look at it again in the jury room when you come to consider your verdict - you know the accused well now, watch his body language, watch the way his eyes go, watch the sharp intakes of breath when he realises that the body of evidence is getting closer and closer to him. You, ladies and gentlemen, know how to evaluate people who are telling the truth or telling lies and that's what you get to do here in this courtroom, to watch witnesses give their evidence and work out whether they are telling you the whole truth, none of the truth or part of the truth, and you do it just the same way as you evaluate anyone in your workplace or your children or in your home and work it out for yourself: Is this person telling me the truth? And you will see from the body language of the accused that he gets more and more worked the more and more facts that are presented to him about cars, locations, workplaces and so on and he tells a complete untruth, in the Crown's submission to you, about not having acquired any cars there.

Now, Mr Haesler, when he opened his case to you yesterday, he said, 'Well of course, it's very hard for us to remember 1991, it's hard to remember who the Premier was and who was the Prime Minister and what was news on the front page', and of course it is, but, ladies and gentlemen, God forbid, if you had killed someone in 1991 you'd remember that and it's not hard for the accused to remember that he killed Mr Flores. He knows that's what the police are there to ask him about and he's certainly not going to help him by volunteering ownership of the car that he knows that he drove away in that morning with his headlights off. You can see his mind working and you can see the way that he tries to mislead the police in that interview and only embraces things when he realises that they've got the evidence.

And then we have, ladies and gentlemen, what the accused says to his father and you might think since the accused's evidence yesterday that there actually is no dispute about word on the tape, that it is 'pled' as in the past tense of 'pled', 'I haven't pled to anything yet'. It seems to be an Americanism, that use of the word, but I'm sure you all understand the meaning. But the accused himself only yesterday said at page 470 of the transcript when I asked him, 'What does it mean?' he says, 'It just means I hadn't pled yet, it had nothing to do with DNA'. So he doesn't seem to have any problem with the transcription that that word there is 'pled'.

And what the Crown says to you about that conversation is it's very clear that the accused is pretty open with his father, not saying, 'Dad, I never did it, I don't know why they think I did it', he's saying, 'Well, we have to find out the type of DNA' and reading between the lines, the Crown submits to you, the type of DNA means whether it's blood or whether it's semen. If it's blood well that's going to be hard to explain, but if it's semen, 'I can pass it off as some toilet sexual activity because of my gay lifestyle'. He doesn't come out and say that to his father but that is obviously exercising his mind, the type of DNA, whether it's really damning, as it would be for blood, or whether it can be explained in some way as it might be for semen or saliva.

But the Crown says to you, ladies and gentlemen, and we have heard from Dr Bruce about the DNA, there is no doubt at all that it's the accused's DNA, he acknowledges that and he accepts it, but we don't really know because there was blood under the fingernails of Mr Flores, certainly blood, but could it have been his blood? Actually the Crown would submit to you: Well, where's the blood come from, because there's not a pool of blood where the hands are, there's no wounds on the body itself, there's some bleeding to the head area, but could Mr Flores have put nine of his fingers, or many of his fingernails, in contact with his own blood or do you agree that the DNA under the fingernails is the accused's DNA from blood, or skin cells at least, but perhaps blood, when the deceased scratched the accused during the course of this terrible ferocious beating which led to Mr Flores' death.

...

The Crown throughout would say this is a murder, pure and simple, a terrible, savage beating by a very large man upon a much smaller man who was very restricted from defending himself in the circumstances.

...

Now, Dr Schwartz doesn't see any of that and ventures the opinion that she couldn't see any defensive wounds, but you might think that Mr Flores got one punch in at one stage, that's a matter for you, but he was clearly powerless, very, very outsized and overpowered by whoever it was who killed him and the Crown says to you, ladies and gentlemen, it is clearly, on all of the evidence, the accused.

...

Mr Khoudair says, 'I would lean towards...sort of injury'. He said the hands were bagged at the scene, so no chance of them somehow coming into contact after death with blood or anything like that. So bear that in mind when you're considering whether the blood under the fingernails - and it wasn't copious, it was hard to see until it was searched for at the Division of Analytical Laboratories, but it was red staining and blood, whether it was the blood of the accused or the blood of the deceased.

...The Crown submits to you, ladies and gentlemen, it's blood from the accused and that's where the DNA comes from, not from anything else, blood and skin cells from the accused.

...

In relation to the comment, 'Do you agree he's seen us' by the Australian male voice in the truck, he said, 'It sounded like a young male Australian voice'. Well, it sounded like a timorous person, you might think, worried about being seen, someone unlikely, you might think, to be someone who was about to punch, stomp and kick someone to death. Whatever they were doing, they were doing it inside the car.

...

Nothing really explains any blood under the fingertips there, ladies and gentlemen. Although there are some bruises and abrasions, no open wounds that would have bled freely enough to have stained nearly all the fingernails you might think.

...

Finally, ladies and gentlemen, the conversations with the father, which is really nothing more than someone working out with his father what he might have to do in the face of overwhelming evidence. He might be able to get a bargain down to manslaughter, he might have to plead to something because they've got this DNA evidence which, even at that stage, you could not really jump over.

He agreed yesterday that the word that he used was 'pled'. He said so in his evidence, 'We have not pled anything yet because we do not know the strength of the DNA'. Not, 'Because I didn't do it' but, 'Because I don't know how strong this evidence is that they're going to bring against me'. His father says, 'Right, yeah, they mightn't have anything on you then, mate'. That means: Isn't this lucky, it mightn't be good enough to prove you killed that fellow. There's nothing there about 'Dad, this is terrible, I don't know how they could have their DNA because I didn't have anything to do with it. I'm innocent, I could never have killed or hurt someone', nothing like that.

This is a man who knew very obviously that every time he went near the Exchange Hotel, which linked him, Darlinghurst, the Pink Pussycat, which linked him to Stephan and might have produced Stephan as a witness, the car, Sunday, he knows very, very well that he killed Felipe Flores. He's had it in his mind ever since. This isn't 'Who was the Prime Minister in 1991?' This is, 'I killed someone in 1991 and they haven't caught up with me yet' and he knew in December 2008 that they had some conversation with the father and this is not someone who is crazy over false accusations, it's someone very calmly weighing up the odds of, 'How much they've got against me? I might have to wear it but maybe I can tough it out and maybe I can convince the jury I didn't do it'.

But, ladies and gentlemen, the accused did it..."" [Italics added - see below].

23Fingernail samples from the deceased returned a presumptive finding positive for the presence of blood. Dr Bruce gave the following evidence-in-chief at the trial:

""Q. There was blood on these fingernail clippings of someone's, is that right?
A. That's correct.

Q. Can one say that the blood was either that of the deceased or that of the accused?
A. No, it is not possible to make that conclusion either way.

Q. Would you consider that it is likely that it is blood from one of those two people or both?
A. All I can say is blood is a likely source of DNA, but again I cannot categorically say whether blood was the likely source of the DNA that matched the victim or the accused.""

24None of these questions was objected to and they appear to create the impression that the evidence showed that blood was found under the fingernails of the deceased. There was no such evidence. A presumptive test does not positively establish the presence of blood. The Crown in this Court conceded that. There had been no definitive testing for the presence of blood and Dr Bruce did not give any evidence of the presence of other possible sources that were capable of producing positive reactions to presumptive testing. The appellant's counsel at the trial did not take up the erroneous proposition inherent in the first quoted question and answer, and the inaccuracy was left to the jury.

25The majority of the tested samples demonstrated a presumptive positive result for blood, yet only a minority demonstrated a mixture of DNA. The Crown submitted to the jury that there was blood under the deceased's fingernails. That submission was based upon a false premise. Furthermore, the Crown submitted at the trial, having regard to the deceased's injuries, that there was no mechanism that accounted for how this blood could have been the deceased's blood: there was no expert opinion that supported that suggestion. Finally, in those circumstances, the Crown submitted at the trial that the appellant's blood was the only explanation for the positive testing and that accordingly accounted for the presence of his DNA.

26In her final address to the jury the Crown Prosecutor stated ""there was blood under the fingernails of Mr Flores, certainly blood, but could it have been his blood?"" She later asked rhetorically, ""could Mr Flores have put nine of his fingers, or many of his fingernails, in contact with his own blood or do you agree that the DNA under the fingernails is the accused's DNA from blood, or skin cells at least, but perhaps blood, when the deceased scratched the accused during the course of this terrible ferocious beating which led to Mr Flores death?"" 

27This theme is reprised later in her submissions: ""The Crown submits to you, ladies and gentlemen, it's blood from the accused and that's where the DNA comes from, not from anything else, blood and skin cells from the accused."" A little later again: ""Nothing really explains any blood under the fingertips there, ladies and gentlemen...no open wounds that would have bled freely enough to have stained nearly all the fingernails you might think.""

28The appellant contended in this Court that there has been a miscarriage of justice on account of the admission of a false premise that blood was detected under the deceased's fingernails and the subsequent Crown submission as to the so-called facts that could be extrapolated from it.

29It will be apparent that there was no evidence before the jury that there was in fact blood on ""nearly all"" of the deceased's fingernails. The jury was arguably misled by the submission that there was in fact blood found there. To the extent that the presumptive testing was properly capable of giving rise to an inference that there was blood, there was no expert evidence that the only explanation for the blood under the deceased's fingernails was that it came from the appellant. According to the appellant, the Crown's final address to the jury contained the expression of an opinion, not based upon or supported by the evidence, that ""the blood"" was only explicable upon the basis that it was the appellant's blood.

30The appellant contended that to the extent that the Crown's expression of opinion went beyond the evidence adduced at the trial, it could not be regarded as benign. That follows because if the ""opinion"" that the appellant was the only explicable source of the ""blood"" were accepted, it must follow that the appellant was guilty on account of the fact that there could be no innocent explanation for ""his blood to be located under the nine fingernails of the deceased"". This was not the evidence and it was unfair and improper to characterise it in such a fashion.

31The issue of the presence of blood excited the attention of the jury in a way that underscores the appellant's current concerns. At page 51 of his Honour's summing up the jury asked, ""Was there any blood on the victim's hands other than the nails?"" That question was clearly infected by the false proposition about which the appellant now complains, namely, that there was blood under the fingernails of the deceased. His Honour answered the question saying, ""None of the witnesses called in the case gave evidence that they saw blood on the victim's hands other than on the nails."" [Emphasis added]

32That answer did not accord with the evidence, as no witnesses observed blood on the deceased's fingernails. The mischief in the way the evidence was adduced and later characterised was perpetuated in the answer, which itself assumed blood had in fact been observed under the fingernails and in a forensic sense excluded the likelihood that the ""blood"" could have been the deceased's blood. 

33The appellant also submitted in this Court that in the course of her final address to the jury, in addition to comments specifically directed to the alleged presence of blood, the Crown Prosecutor advanced a number of statements and propositions that were at odds with the facts and otherwise unsupported by the evidence. It was contended uncontroversially that the appellant was entitled to have the prosecutor properly discharge her duty to act fairly and with detachment, and always with the objective of establishing the whole truth in order that his trial was fair: Whitehorn v The Queen [1983] HCA 42; (1983) 152 CLR 657 at 663-4; Wood v R [2012] NSWCCA 21 at [577]. It is also uncontroversial that the conduct of a Crown Prosecutor at trial can result in a successful appeal against conviction where that conduct has resulted in a miscarriage of justice: Lawless v The Queen [1979] HCA 49; (1979) 142 CLR 659 at 673; R v Shaw (1991) 57 A Crim R 425. This can arise by reason of an intemperate address to the jury: McCullough v R [1982] Tas R 43; (1982) 6 A Crim R 274. It was, in contrast, very much in contest that the prosecutor had failed to fulfil or to discharge that duty to the prejudice of the appellant in the circumstances of this case.

34Some of the matters to which the appellant drew attention are as follows.

35The Crown Prosecutor suggested to the jury that the accused was a very tall man but that ""he wasn't marching alone like a soldier marching along at his full height when he went back into that car, so Mr Small thought it was a man of about 5 foot 6 to 5 foot 8."" She had previously suggested that the accused had ""skulked back to [the] car so that the night watchman wouldn't be able to see him from 80 to 90 metres away what his true height was."" The Crown Prosecutor added that the accused had ""been 6 foot 7 since he was 16 years of age, he knows how conspicuous a man of his height is and how you can get into trouble, 'The big bloke did it'."" 

36These submissions were all speculative. There was no evidence to support them. The Crown Prosecutor was inviting the jury to rationalise the security guard's description with the known height of the appellant upon the basis that he must have been crouching or ""skulking"", as she described it, thereby permitting an inference that the person of the height seen and described by the security guard could still have been the appellant. This behaviour was also likened to his alleged conduct ""in a similar vein to not turning on his headlights as he was leaving."" In other words, the jury was being asked to reason that the so-called skulking person and the driver of the car who had not turned on his lights must have been the appellant because the conduct was in both cases intended to avoid detection and only a person of the appellant's height would have walked in that way. 

37It will be immediately apparent that such reasoning is circular and flawed. The submission made to the jury was apt to mislead and confuse. There was no evidence that any person at the scene observed by the security guard was anything other than of the height that he described. There was no description given of a crouching man. The submission was at odds with the facts and otherwise unsupported by the evidence.

38The Crown Prosecutor addressed the jury upon the basis that the evidence established that the appellant ""came home with scratch marks on 2 September 1991."" That was incorrect. The evidence rose no higher than that Ms Webber believed that she observed scratch marks on the appellant in about September 1991.

39The Crown Prosecutor also suggested to the jury that the deceased ""was clearly powerless, very, very outsized and overpowered by whoever it was who killed him."" That submission was ultimately enlarged to, ""The Crown throughout would say this is a murder, pure and simple, a terrible, savage beating by a very large man upon a much smaller man who was very restricted from defending himself in the circumstances."" There is no evidence anywhere at all to support the submission that the deceased was ""very, very outsized"" or that this was a beating committed ""by a very large man upon a much smaller man."" The iniquity in saying so is that it invites the jury illogically to reason and possibly to conclude that because the deceased suffered such terrible injuries a large person must have inflicted them. It therefore follows that because the appellant was a large person, it must have been him. Once again that submission is circular and unavailable in the terms used upon the evidence.

40Three consecutive paragraphs of the Crown Prosecutor's address to the jury are particularly offensive to the proper understanding of how a prosecutor should behave. I have italicised them in the reproduction of the Crown Prosecutor's address set out earlier. There are several serious problems with what the jury were told.

41The first of the paragraphs is directed to a consideration of the appellant's truthfulness, in the context of his memory. The prosecutor said, ""ladies and gentlemen, God forbid, if you had killed someone in 1991 you'd remember that and it's not hard for the accused to remember that he killed Mr Flores."" It would have been perfectly acceptable for the jury to be told that they should not believe the appellant when he denied killing the deceased. What the prosecutor was doing, however, was to assert conclusively that the appellant did kill the deceased, and to seek to support that assertion upon the basis that the appellant could not be believed if he could not remember owning a car that other contested evidence suggested had been at the scene. That attack was inferentially thereby directed to the worth of his denial of killing the deceased that the jury were being told was a fact. That was both improper and unfair.

42The second and third italicised paragraphs are concerned with the appellant's intercepted telephone conversation with his father while he was in gaol on remand awaiting trial. It is necessary to set out the relevant terms of the conversation, which are as follows:

""Accused: The lawyer came out and saw me last Tuesday.

Peter: Oh right.

Peter: Yeah so you have to wait until the 19th June.

Accused: Yeah.

Peter: That's a long way away.

Accused: Yeah about ten weeks. The prosecutors are trying to get all their shit together apparently my lawyer already has a QC barrister lined up. Apparently there is a partial DNA on this persons shirt 1 in 180 thousand - then apparently fairly common. But under the fingernails is 1 in 580 thousand.

Peter: Oh.

Accused: But they don't know what type.

Peter: Oh.

Accused: And previously there was two other suspects and they are both since deceased.

Peter: Two more.

Accused: Two other suspects they are both since deceased, passed on, dead.

Peter: Oh so.

Accused: According to my lawyer the only thing they have is the DNA so my lawyer is going to check out what type it is, the validity of it how it was stored for the last 17 to 18 years.

Peter: Oh right, yeah they might had nothing on you then mate.

Accused: Yeah they probably want to strike up a bargain, like drop it from murder down to manslaughter.

Peter: You are not having that are you?

Accused: Well we have not pled anything yet, because we do not know the strength of the DNA.

Peter: You won't plead guilty to nothing at the moment.

Accused. No.

Peter: No.""

43It was always the Crown case at trial that this conversation amounted either to an admission by the appellant or was demonstrative of a consciousness of guilt, because an innocent person would neither have entertained the possibility of being inculpated by DNA results nor reserved his position on his plea in such circumstances. Such submissions were genuinely available and open to the Crown. What was to be made of the conversation always remained a matter for the jury. 

44However, I do not consider that it was proper for the Crown Prosecutor to descend, in the context of a contest about whether particular samples of DNA were or were not blood or semen, to characterise the position confronted by the appellant in the course of the conversation as being something he can potentially pass off ""as some sort of toilet sexual activity because of [his] gay lifestyle"". In my opinion, comments such as that were inflammatory and derogatory and likely, if not actually intended, to cause unfair prejudice to the appellant. The expression ""toilet sexual activity"" was gratuitously pejorative and fundamentally irrelevant. It represented a crossing of the boundary between what was legitimate and what was illegitimate for a Crown Prosecutor to say to a jury.

45Moreover, the Crown Prosecutor asserted to the jury ""the accused did it"". She postulated an hypothetical thought that the appellant might have had when speaking to his father in the intercepted telephone conversation: ""I might have to wear it but maybe I can tough it out and maybe I can convince the jury I didn't do it."" The Crown Prosecutor did not in her address confine her references to the telephone conversation evidence as demonstrating a consciousness of guilt but arguably treated it as if it were a confession to the murder of the deceased. That was an unwarranted extrapolation from the statement made by the appellant to his father concerning forensic choices and decisions that were to be made when the DNA results were to hand into a statement that the appellant had it in his mind to deceive the jury. That was an inappropriate and intemperate remark for the Crown Prosecutor to have made.

46Finally, the appellant also complains that, in the context of alleged admissions made by the appellant to his then partner, the Crown Prosecutor suggested to the jury that they ""know the accused well now"" and that they ""know the type of man he is."" The Crown Prosecutor also said, ""you know the accused well now, watch his body language, watch the way his eyes go, watch the sharp intakes of breath when he realises that the body of evidence is getting closer and closer to him."" That submission appears to be based upon what the Crown Prosecutor suggested the jury could draw from the appellant's ERISP. While it may have been couched in somewhat flamboyant terms, it did not in my opinion go beyond what was permissible in the circumstances. I am somewhat reluctantly prepared to accept that it amounted in effect to no more than a submission that the jury were entitled to assess the appellant as a witness in the ordinary course of their deliberations.

47In my opinion the Crown Prosecutor's address to the jury went beyond what was permissible. The question is whether anything flows, or ought to flow, from this conclusion, having regard to the fact that no complaint about the Crown Prosecutor's address to the jury was raised at the time.

48Leave to rely upon an error to which no objection was taken at the trial will be granted where the appellant can demonstrate that the error has led to a miscarriage of justice: R v Abusafiah (1991) 24 NSWLR 531 at 536; R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 20; (2005) 62 NSWLR 346 at [20] - [24]; Picken v R [2007] NSWCCA 319; R v Kanaan [2005] NSWCCA 385; (2005) 157 A Crim R 238 at [99]; Sanchez v R [2009] NSWCCA 171; (2009) 196 A Crim R 472 at [60].

49Mason P referred to the issue in the following way in Picken at [20] - [22]:

""[20] Leave to rely on an error to which no objection had been taken at the trial will be granted only where the appellant can demonstrate that the error led to a miscarriage of justice. There have been varying formulations of the test for identifying a miscarriage of justice in this context (see Tripodina and Morabito v R (1988) 35 A Crim R 183 at 195; Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297 at 319; R v Wilson (2005) 62 NSWLR 346 at 352 [20]). 

[21] It appears to be generally accepted that the appellant must at least establish that he or she has lost a real chance (or a chance fairly open) of being acquitted. 

[22] The question of leave in accordance with rule 4 needs to be addressed in relation to the particular error identified by the appellant and its impact, in isolation and in conjunction with other errors, upon the justice of the conviction under challenge.""

50It is reasonably clear, however, that rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules does not operate in the circumstances of this case. A failure by counsel to object to perceived inaccuracies in the Crown's address or to its allegedly extravagant or intemperate tone does not fit easily within the description of a direction, omission to direct, or decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence. In my opinion the appellant has in any event demonstrated that by reason of the problems with the Crown Prosecutor's address that I have identified, he lost a chance that was fairly open of being acquitted and that the impugned address to the jury has led to a miscarriage of justice. To the extent that it is required, leave to appeal should in those circumstances be granted.

51The Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provides relevantly as follows:

""6 Determination of appeals in ordinary cases 

(1) The court on any appeal under section 5 (1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that ... on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice...

(2) Subject to the special provisions of this Act, the court shall, if it allows an appeal under section 5 (1) against conviction, quash the conviction and direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered.

8 Power of court to grant new trial 

(1) On an appeal against a conviction on indictment, the court may, either of its own motion, or on the application of the appellant, order a new trial in such manner as it thinks fit, if the court considers that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, and, that having regard to all the circumstances, such miscarriage of justice can be more adequately remedied by an order for a new trial than by any other order which the court is empowered to make.

(2)...""

52The appellant submitted that the interests of justice required that he not stand trial again, but that a verdict of acquittal be entered: Spies v The Queen [2000] HCA 43; (2000) 74 ALJR 1263 at 1283; DPP (Nauru) v Fowler [1984] HCA 48; (1984) 154 CLR 627. 

53The appellant referred in particular to the following matters. First, the assessment of the strength of the evidence at any new trial. Secondly, the delay between the date of the offence and any new trial, which has occasioned significant prejudice in the absence of any records as to the time that the deceased attended the ATM, a matter going to the timing of the death of the deceased in comparison to the sightings of him earlier in the evening at or near the Exchange Hotel. Thirdly, any new trial would be an instrument of injustice in circumstances where the prosecution in the first trial improperly enlarged the evidentiary material relied upon in support of its case. Fourthly, any new trial would necessarily be different to that originally presented inasmuch as the prosecution will be unable to assert certainly that blood was under the deceased's fingernails or that it was the appellant's blood. Finally, a new trial would provide the prosecution with an opportunity to recast its case, which should not be permitted.

54The appellant also contended that the discretion to order a new trial should not be exercised where the miscarriage of justice has come about as the result of the conduct of the Crown Prosecutor: R v Walton [1999] NSWCCA 452; (1999) 113 A Crim R 308 at [53]; R v Kennedy [2000] NSWCCA 487; (2000) 118 A Crim R 34 at [83]; R v Teasdale [2004] NSWCCA 91 at [48].

55The paramount consideration must ultimately be whether or not any new trial will itself be fair. I am not satisfied in the particular circumstances of this case that a re-trial could not be overseen in a way that would be entirely fair to the appellant. Indeed, the eradication of the matters to which the present appeal was directed would produce a trial that was arguably fairer to the appellant than the trial about which he complains. I consider that a new trial should be ordered.

Ground 1 

56Ground 1 is concerned with the admission of the appellant's statements to his father in the intercepted telephone conversation and the trial judge's failure to direct the jury in respect of these admissions in accordance with Edwards.

57First, it does not seem to me that the trial judge erred in any respect in admitting the transcript of the intercepted telephone conversation. Howsoever one characterises the material, whether as a representation capable of demonstrating a consciousness of guilt, or as material inconsistent with the appellant's case that he did not kill the deceased, the issue is how the jury could or should make use of that material and whether or not that was correctly explained to the jury by the trial judge. There is no fundamental anterior basis upon which his Honour ought to have excluded the material in the first place or that supports a submission in this Court that he erred in admitting it.

58Secondly, Edwards has no application to the representations concerned. It has not been suggested that the appellant was telling a lie in the course of the conversation with his father or that any such lie was relied upon by the Crown either to strengthen its case or to corroborate some other evidence. On the contrary, the Crown case promoted the truth of what the appellant said as indicating or proving, or tending to prove, his guilt or as material demonstrating a consciousness of guilt. Whatever direction should have been given to the jury concerning that evidence, it did not require a direction in accordance with what is generally understood as an Edwards direction.

59I do not consider that this ground has been made out.

Ground 2

60The relevant portion of the trial judge's directions to which this ground is directed is as follows:

""The next question with which I want to deal concerns the question of lies. The Crown contended that the accused told a lie in his interview with police when he said that he had not bought any cars whilst he was in Sydney. Clearly enough that answer is not correct because it is clear that he purchased the vehicle which had the registration number GAA 316 (Exhibit E). The first question you have to resolve is whether the matter raised by the Crown does constitute a lie. Counsel on behalf of the accused contended that the accused's statements on this issue could not amount to a lie. They were simply attributable to a failure of recollection. It was submitted, given the lengthy passage of time that had elapsed before the interview was conducted with him in 2008, that it was entirely understandable that he had initially forgotten about that car. The Crown submitted that such a scenario was unlikely given that the vehicle had caused the accused a considerable degree of trouble.

Be that as it may, before you could conclude that the accused's statement was capable of amounting to a lie, you would first need to be satisfied that his car was in fact the vehicle about which the security guard, Mr Robert Small gave evidence. If, on the other hand, it was not the same vehicle, then the suggested lie would have absolutely no relevance to the case. Were that to be the situation, you would simply put the evidence about the accused's statement in the interview to one side. However, even if were to conclude that what the accused said did constitute a lie, you will know from your own experience that people tell lies for all sorts of reasons. Accordingly, you would also need to consider whether that particular lie was in any way material to the issues with which you are concerned.

Furthermore, if you were to find that what the accused said did constitute a lie then it is for you to decide what significance that lie has in relation to the issues in the case but I give you this important warning: do not follow a process of reasoning to the effect that just because a person is shown to have told a lie about something that is, of itself, evidence of guilt.""

61The appellant submitted that his Honour's directions were confined to the consciousness of guilt attaching to the alleged lie about ownership of the motor vehicle, and did not go as far as conforming with the terms of an Edwards direction as generally understood. His Honour did not postulate any innocent explanation for the alleged lie and did not explain that lies may be told out of panic or fear or unjust accusation. The appellant contended that the omission was particularly significant in the light of the excesses contained in the Crown address about which complaint is also made.

62The Crown's submissions certainly went further than simply dealing with the alleged lie about ownership of the vehicle in the context of a consciousness of guilt. They extended to the appellant's demeanour during his ERISP and to ""the type of man he was"". The appellant contended that there was in such circumstances a pressing need for a particularly rigorous Edwards direction.

63I do not consider that his Honour's direction was inadequate at all. It was specifically crafted to the statement said to be a lie. It directly adverted to the fact that a person may tell a lie for all sorts of reasons. Having regard to the collective common sense of the jury, it seems to be unnecessary for a trial judge to postulate in terms the full range of such reasons. It was also inherent in his Honour's direction that the possible innocent explanation for the lie was a failure of the appellant's recollection. That was the very way in which the appellant's counsel had sought to explain it at the trial.

64I do not consider that this ground has been made out.

Orders

65In my opinion the following orders should be made:

1. Grant leave to appeal.

2. Allow the appeal.

3. Quash the conviction.

4. Order that there be a new trial. 

66BELLEW J: I agree with Harrison J.

		10 April 2014",2013-05-19 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2706750,In an Application by Bassam Hamzy [2013] NSWCA 121,"Judgment

1BASTEN JA: On Friday 10 May 2012, the applicant sought (ex parte) urgent interim orders from this Court in circumstances to which reference will be made shortly. In substance, orders were sought under ss 7 and 8 of the Court Suppression and Non-Publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW) and related to criminal proceedings which had concluded with sentences being imposed in the District Court in the early afternoon of 10 May, the day the application was made. No evidence was placed before this Court, which was required to act on the basis of statements from counsel.

2The District Court proceedings involved the sentencing of the applicant on a number of charges in circumstances where he had provided assistance to the authorities for which he was granted a discount under s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). During the course of the hearing in the District Court, non-publication orders were in force, which were lifted when judgment was delivered.

3The matter came before the Court of Appeal on the basis that there is an appeal from the District Court under s 14 of the Court Suppression Orders Act, although that appeal will go to the Court of Criminal Appeal in due course, if it is pursued, pursuant to the approach adopted in Fairfax Digital Australia and New Zealand Pty Limited v Ibrahim [2012] NSWCCA 125. As I had not been appointed to sit in the Court of Criminal Appeal, I exercised whatever jurisdiction this Court has under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW). Given that it would have been difficult to obtain a judge in the Court of Criminal Appeal at short notice, I did not consider that the availability of appellate relief in that Court was a reason for not granting orders if they should otherwise be made at this stage. 

4During the course of the proceedings in the District Court, the non-publication orders then in force apparently extended to, in the words of counsel for the applicant, a ""blanket order"" suppressing publication of what was said in those proceedings, both in evidence and in submissions. Although for an initial period the court was closed, for most of the proceedings it was not. The purpose of the non-publication orders was to protect an ongoing investigation and, presumably, to protect the identity of persons whose safety might be in question if they were identified.

5The applicant was sentenced on 10 May by Judge Zahra, who delivered reasons and made orders orally, commencing at 10am and continuing through until 1.45pm. At the outset, he indicated that the reasons were being delivered in open court and that he was lifting the suppression order which was then in effect. The applicant was named in the announcement of the court sittings and it must have been known to those who were in the court who he was. 

6In the course of the reasons there may have been reference to the fact that he gave assistance. I do not know if there was any identification of the assistance in fact given. It is usual in my experience where assistance is provided that the sentencing judge will note that it has been taken into account and will on occasion detail the nature of the assistance given in a document which is not available publicly. That course has also been taken in the Court of Criminal Appeal. On some occasions, though more rarely, the name of the person being sentenced has been suppressed on the basis that he or she is an informant, disclosure of whose identity might give rise to concerns for his or her safety. That appears to have occurred in one of the cases involved in the same array of offending as that in which the applicant was involved.

7Whether or not anything was revealed in the judgment which would cause concern for the applicant's safety is not a matter on which I could form an opinion in the absence of any material at all other than the assertions of counsel, who was not present in the District Court. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that the sentencing judge decided not to provide a hard copy of his reasons, which was due to occur at 2pm that afternoon, because it was indicated to him that an application would be made in this Court to seek a suppression order. It would have been appropriate at that stage for any solicitor who was present and acting for the applicant to have obtained a copy of the written reasons so that they could have been put before this Court. In the absence of that document or a solicitor's affidavit setting out the matters giving rise to concern, I was uninformed as to the precise nature of the concern which was sought to be raised.

8What was clear, however, was that the applicant had sought a discount based on assistance and he himself must have provided evidence of that assistance to the sentencing judge. It also appears that submissions were sought by the sentencing judge as to whether, when reasons were delivered, any suppression order then in force should be lifted. Accordingly, the applicant was on notice that that might occur and provided written submissions in advance. (They were not before me either.) In these circumstances it was by no means clear that the way in which the matter came before this Court was one which necessitated, either by reason of some unexpected event which took place in the District Court, or by a step being taken by the sentencing judge which was out of accord with normal practice, even an interim suppression order being made. 

9A number of factors militated against making an order of the kind sought. First, to the extent that reasons had been delivered orally in open court and the applicant had been identified, the application to this Court was in one sense too late. Counsel for the applicant suggested that it was not necessarily too late if publication of the material had not then occurred. There was no evidence before me as to whether publication had occurred or not. I could imagine that there would be some public interest in the material contained in the judge's reasons for sentence and in the orders made.

10Secondly, I did take account of the fact that the judge is a highly experienced criminal lawyer and trial judge. I did that not because, as counsel said, experienced judges do not err. All judges can make errors. The point was rather that, in the absence of any material which would indicate the basis upon which the present application was made, I did not think it appropriate to assume that an error of the kind which must now be presumed had taken place.

11Thirdly, it is common practice to disclose the name of a person who is sentenced and the fact that assistance has been given without the use of a pseudonym. In some cases, as mentioned above, that practice is not adopted, but there is usually a good reason for that. The usual practice is not to disclose the nature of the assistance. The assumption that the nature of the assistance had been disclosed in the reasons for judgment, which have already been delivered in open court, was not one which I was prepared to make in the absence of any evidence which might support such a finding. 

12The final point raised by counsel was that there could be disclosure of the nature of the assistance, either from documents tendered in the course of the sentencing proceedings or from the transcript of the sentencing hearing. That would accord with the suppression order in place during the sentence proceedings. It was suggested that the evidence and transcript are no longer protected by a suppression order. That suggestion was assumed to be true for present purposes. It seemed unlikely that any member of the public would at that stage have had access to the evidence which was tendered in the sentencing hearing, or to the transcript. I was accordingly prepared to make a suppression order in relation to that material, on an interim basis and on the assumption that in some way this matter will come before the Court of Criminal Appeal in the near future. That order will not extend to the reasons for judgment delivered in open court, or the sentences imposed.

13Accordingly, I ordered that the evidence given in, and transcript of, the sentencing hearing before Judge Zahra in relation to the applicant not be disclosed or published in any form until further order of this Court or the Court of Criminal Appeal. Otherwise I dismissed the application.

14At counsel's request, I directed that this application be anonymised, although that step may have been inconsistent with the reasons given above and may have caused confusion as to the subject-matter of the orders. On reflection, that restraint should now be lifted.

15The application was made orally. I direct that the solicitor acting on this application forthwith file the necessary summons to commence proceedings in this Court.

		20 May 2013",2013-05-09 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2706754,"Kyluk Pty Ltd v Chief Executive, Office of Environment and Heritage [2013] NSWCCA 114","Judgment

1PRICE J: This is an appeal from a sentence imposed by Pain J in the Land and Environment Court in which her Honour convicted Kyluk Pty Limited (the appellant) of an offence contrary to s 118A(2) of the National Parks and Wildlife Act (1974) (the NPW Act) and made orders for payment for restoration works, the carrying out of remediation, publication of the court's orders, and costs: Chief Executive, Office of Environment and Heritage v Kyluk Pty Limited (No 3) [2012] NSWLEC 56 (Kyluk (No 3)). 

2The appellant is the registered proprietor of a rural property (the property) consisting of approximately 40.31ha situated at Gilead, on the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales. The appellant was summonsed to answer two charges against s 118(A)(2) of the NPW Act of picking plants between about 11 June 2009 and 11 August 2009 that were part of an endangered ecological community (EEC). One charge related to the EEC being Shale/Sandstone Transition Forest (SSTF) and the other to the EEC being Cumberland Plain Woodland (CPW). 

3The charge of picking CPW was withdrawn before the trial judge on 14 February 2012 and the appellant pleaded guilty to the charge of picking SSTF. 

4For this charge, the summons provided particulars of the EEC as being ""Shale/Sandstone Transition Forest in the Sydney Basin Bioregion (as described in the final determination of the Scientific Committee to list the ecological community) which at the time of the offence was listed in Part 3 of Schedule 1 to the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 as an endangered ecological community"". The plants included ""Allocasuarina littoralis, Eucalyptus crebra, Eucalyptus eugeniodes, Eucalyptus punctata, Eucalyptus pilularis, Eucalyptus tereticornis, and Kunzea ambigua"". Particulars were not supplied as to the number of the plants or the extent of the area of SSTF that was alleged to have been picked.

5At the commencement of the hearing, the appellant's senior counsel told her Honour that the appellant objected to the prosecutor's proposed tender of a report from Mitchell Tulau, a soil scientist, and six reports from Theresa James, a botanist, and that the extent of the area of SSTF picked by the appellant was in dispute. 

6The prosecutor withdrew four of Ms James' reports, but pressed two reports. A voir dire on the admissibility of the reports of both experts was held on 16 and 17 February 2012. On 20 February 2012, the trial judge admitted the reports: Office of Environment and Heritage v Kyluk Pty Limited [2012] NSWLEC 22 (Kyluk (No 1)).

7Ms James had estimated that the area of SSTF that had been cleared was 12.54 hectares. Mr Tulau was of the opinion that the spatial extent of the areas of the property consistent with soils and landforms described in the final determination as SSTF was approximately 5 hectares. 

8The proceedings on sentence continued on 22 February 2012 during which the prosecutor sought to tender a statement of facts. The appellant's senior counsel objected to various parts of the proposed statement and the trial judge was required to make rulings on admissibility, following which the statement of facts, subject to her Honour's rulings was admitted. 

9An affidavit of Leslie Allen Winch, a tree management officer with the Campbelltown City Council was included in the material that was tendered before her Honour. He had inspected the property and estimated that approximately 6 acres had been cleared. He also estimated that between 5,000 and 7,000 medium to large trees were removed. Judgment was reserved on 23 February 2012. 

10On 20 March 2012, the trial judge delivered judgment. One of the findings made by her Honour was that the area of SSTF cleared by the appellant was 12.54 hectares. Another was that the offence was of moderate to severe objective seriousness. A 15 per cent discount on sentence was allowed for the utilitarian value of the guilty plea. The appellant was convicted and the following orders were made by the trial judge: 

""...
2.Pursuant to s 205(1)(d) of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 the Defendant is to pay $127,500 to the Campbelltown City Council for the purposes of the project ""Restoration Works at Noorumba Reserve, Gilead Project"" as detailed in Annexure A with the timetable for payment to be made within 14 days by agreement or order of the Court.
3.Pursuant to s 200 of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 the Defendant must carry out restoration works at the property in accordance with Annexure B subject to the amendment of the plan identifying the area to be restored in accordance with par 153 of this judgment. 
4.Pursuant to s 205(1)(a) of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974: 
(a)The Defendant, within 28 days of this order, is to place a notice in the Campbelltown-Macarthur Advertiser within the first six pages at a minimum size of 18cm x 12cm in the form of Annexure C. 
(b)The Defendant, within 14 days of this order, is to provide to the Prosecutor a complete copy of the page of the publication in which the notice appears. 
(c)All future public references by the Defendant to the payment towards the ""Restoration Works at Noorumba Reserve, Gilead Project"" referred to in order 2 shall be accompanied by the following passage: 
""Kyluk Pty Limited's contribution to the funding of the Campbelltown City Council's Restoration Works at Noorumba Reserve, Gilead Project is part of a penalty imposed on it by the Land and Environment Court of NSW after it was convicted of picking plants that formed part of an endangered ecological community, an offence against s 118A(2) of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974.""
5.The Defendant must pay the Prosecutor's costs of the proceedings as agreed or assessed."" 

11The appellant advances 13 Grounds of Appeal. The first group of Grounds (Grounds 2, 3, 4 and 5) relates to the admissibility of the expert evidence adduced by the prosecution.

12The second group of Grounds (Grounds 1,7 and 12) relates to the proper construction of the final determination of the Scientific Committee. 

13The third group of Grounds (Grounds 6,8-11) relates to the approach to be adopted in sentencing in Class 5 matters. The final Ground (Ground 13) relates to the issue of whether the sentence was too severe. 

14Before considering the Grounds of Appeal, it is convenient to refer to the statutory scheme upon which the prosecution was founded. 

The statutory scheme 

15Section 118A(2) of the NPW Act is as follows: 

""118A Harming or picking threatened species, endangered populations or endangered ecological communities 

(2) A person must not pick any plant that is of, or is part of a threatened species, an endangered population or an endangered ecological community. 

Penalty:

(a) in respect of any species presumed extinct, any critically endangered species or any endangered species, population or ecological community - 2,000 penalty units or imprisonment for 2 years or both, and an additional 100 penalty units in respect of each whole plant that was affected by or concerned in the action that constituted the offence, 

(b) in respect of any vulnerable species - 500 penalty units or imprisonment for 1 year or both, and an additional 50 penalty units in respect of each whole plant that was affected by or concerned in the action that constituted the offence.""

16Section 5 of the NPW Act defines the term ""endangered ecological community"" to mean an endangered or critically endangered ecological community within the meaning of the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995. 

17Pursuant to s 4 of the Threatened Species Conservation Act, the term ""endangered ecological community"" means an ecological community specified in Part 3 of Schedule 1. 

18The Threatened Species Conservation Act, Sch 1, Pt 3, specified as an endangered ecological community: 

""Shale/Sandstone Transition Forest (as described in the final determination of the Scientific Committee to list the ecological community""

19The final determination of the Scientific Committee was as follows:

""1.Shale/Sandstone Transition Forest (SSTF) is the name given to the plant community characterised by the species assemblage listed in paragraph 4, which occurs on areas transitional between the clay soils derived from Wianamatta Shale and the sandy soils derived from Hawkesbury Sandstone on the margins of the Cumberland Plain. All sites are within the Sydney Basin Bioregion. (The community is identified and discussed in UBBS (1997) under the name Western Shale/Sandstone Transition Forest. Most of the UBBS Eastern Shale/Sandstone Transition Forest is attributable to Cooks River Clay Plain Scrub Forest.)
2. SSTF occurs or has occurred in the Bankstown, Baulkham Hills, Blue Mountains, Campbelltown, Hawkesbury, Liverpool, Parramatta, Penrith, and Wollondilly Local Government Areas (LGAs).
3. The floristic composition of the community includes species otherwise characteristic of, or occurring in, either sandstone or shale habitats. The structure of the community is forest or woodland.
4. SSTF is characterised by an assemblage of species:
[lists 106 species of plants which includes Allocasuarina littoralis, Eucalyptus crebra, Eucalyptus eugenioides, Eucalyptus punctata, Eucalyptus pilularis, Eucalyptus tereticornis, and Kunzea ambigua]. 
Not all these species will be present in every single stand, and the total species list from all stands of the community is considerably larger than that listed above. Depending on the disturbance history of a particular site a proportion of the species may be present only in the soil seed bank.
5. Characteristic tree species in SSTF are; Eucalyptus punctata, Eucalyptus resinifera, one of the stringybarks (Eucalyptus globoidea, Eucalyptus eugenioides, Eucalyptus sparsifolia, Eucalyptus agglomerata). One or more ironbarks (Eucalyptus fibrosa, Eucalyptus crebra, Eucalyptus paniculata, Eucalyptus beyeriana) may be locally important.
6. SSTF has an understorey which may be either grassy and herbaceous or of a shrubby nature. In areas that have not been burnt for an extended period of time the understorey may be dense.
7. Species composition varies between sites depending on geographical location and local conditions (e.g., topography, relative influence of sandstone or shale).
8. SSTF provides habitat for a number of plant species recognised as being of national, state or regional conservation significance in UBBS (1997). These include:
[lists 46 species of plants which includes Eucalyptus pilularis] 
9. SSTF generally occurs on soils derived from a shallow shale or clay material overlying sandstone, or where shale-derived materials has washed down over sandstone-derived substrate. Such sites are generally close to the geological boundary between the Wianamatta Shale and the Hawkesbury Sandstone.
10. SSTF occurs on plateaux and hillsides and at the margins of shale cappings over sandstone.
11. Many occurrences of SSTF are as linear stands, which may be as narrow as 20 metres. The small size and scattered distribution of the remnant stands of the community makes provision of a comprehensive map of occurrences impractical. Details of the distribution of many stands are provided in UBBS (1997).
12. Adjacent communities on shale soils are generally Cumberland Plain Woodland, while adjacent communities on sandstone soils are generally part of the Sydney Sandstone Complex (sensu Benson & Howell 1990).
13. Small areas of SSTF are presently included in only three conservation reserves, Blue Mountains National Park, Cattai National Park and Gulguer Nature Reserve. 
14. A large proportion of the area where SSTF occurred in the past has been cleared for agriculture and urban development. Remnants are small and scattered. Identified threats include: clearing, physical damage from recreational activities, rubbish dumping, grazing, mowing and weed invasion.
15. In view of the small size of existing remnants the threat of further clearing and other threatening processes, the Scientific Committee is of the opinion that SSTF in the Sydney Basin Bioregion is likely to become extinct in nature unless the circumstances and factors threatening its survival cease to operate and that listing as an endangered ecological community is warranted.""

20I do not propose to deal with the grounds of appeal in chronological order, but will consider the grounds concerning the admissibility of the experts' reports before moving on to those grounds that relate to the proper construction of the final determination of the Scientific Committee.

Mr Tulau's report 

21Grounds 2 and 3 of the appeal concern Mr Tulau's report. Before dealing with these Grounds, some reference should be made to the contents of the report and to the oral evidence given by Mr Tulau on the voire dire. 

22Mr Tulau is a Senior Environmental Scientist (Project Leader) with the Soil Science Section Division in the Office of Environment and Heritage (OEH). He holds a B.SC (Hons) from Macquarie University majoring in soils and geomorphology. He has had 21 years experience in soil landscape mapping and related work in New South Wales and his responsibilities include OEH's soil landscape mapping program. There was no challenge to Mr Tulau's expertise as a witness. 

23At par 2.2 of the report, Mr Tulau details his instructions that include a request to provide expert opinion: 

""...as to whether soil and landforms located at the Property are consistent with that described in the Scientific Committee's Final Determination listing for Shale/sandstone Transition Forest as an endangered ecological community and, if consistent, the extent and area of the soils and landforms present."" 

24In describing the methodology used during the field inspection of the property, Mr Tulau states at par 5.1:

""The six (6) sites were placed at the locations of the survey sites of [Teresa] James (2009)...Soil inspection was carried out using a stainless steel spade, and hand auger. The soils were photographed, and basic field measurements including texture and field pH undertaken according to soil layer. The soils were also sampled according to soil layer. Samples for laboratory analysis were submitted to the Department's Yanco Natural Resources Laboratory through a documented chain of custody."" (underlining added) 

25Mr Tulau recounts at par 5.2 that ""[p]article size analysis for fourteen (14) samples from the six (6) sites was requested using the methodology of Craze etal (1992)...The results were compared with other published results from soils derived from sandstone and shale (Chapman & Murphy 1989; Bannerman & Hazelton 1990; Hazelton & Tille 1990; Murphy 1993)."" 

26""Particle size analysis"" results are discussed in sections 6.1 to 6.6 of the report. Of particular significance are what are described as the results from sites 4 and 8 (Tables 3 and 4 below). 

27Mr Tulau provides the following Table in respect of site 4:

30After a discussion of the soil characteristics in Table 4, Mr Tulau states: 

""It is concluded that the soils at this site were largely derived from sandstone, but are partly transitional to shale materials."" 

31Mr Tulau discusses in section 7 the results of the Particle Size analyses. providing in section 7.1 two triangular diagrams (Figures 8 and 9). Figure 8 is described as a ""Particle size fraction diagram, showing previously published data"" whereas Figure 9 is described as ""Particle size Fraction diagram, including results from this survey."" 

32In referring to ""previously published data"", Mr Tulau states in section 7.1: 

""Particle size analyses from the six sites on the Property have been compared to published results of particle size analyses from soils of known derivation and from similar landscapes from elsewhere in the Sydney Basin (Hazelton & Tille 1990; Chapman & Murphy 1989; Bannerman & Hazelton 1990; Murphy 1993). Data from these reports has been extracted from geomorphically equivalent residual soil landscapes (being Blacktown (derived from shales) and Faulconbridge and Bundeena (derived from sandstones)), and presented on the triangular particle size analysis diagram (Marshall 1947) (Figure 8)."" 

33Figure 9 was said to place the results from the 14 samples collected from the property in context. Table 7 provides a table of soil samples with type, percentage, and weight of coarse fragments. Mr Tulau, relevantly, went on to report at p 40: 

""These results from Figure 9 and Table 7, together with other field indicators, as discussed in sections 6.1 to 6.6, indicate that the soils at 

...

Site 4 are largely derived from shale, but could also be characterised as transitional

Site 8 largely derived from sandstone, but are partly transitional to shale...""

34In section 8, in answer to request to provide an expert opinion ""as to whether soil and landforms located at the property...are consistent with that described in the Scientific Committee's final determination listing Shale Sandstone Transition Forest as an endangered ecological community..."", Mr Tulau responds at p 45: 

""Certain areas of the Property are consistent with the soils and landforms described in the Scientific Committee's Final Determination listing Shale Sandstone Transition Forest as an endangered ecological community. The spatial extent of these areas are estimated at approximately 5 ha."" (underlining added)

35In cross-examination concerning site 4, Mr Tulau gave the following evidence (T16/2/12 p19 L40-50, p20 L1-30): 

""Q. In relation to site 4, your opinion is, isn't it, that on balance the soil you sampled there was consistent with having been largely derived from shale, but perhaps could also be characterised as transitional soil?
A. Yes 

Q. You knew, didn't you, from reading the code that applies to expert reports, that you're required to state the facts upon which you based that opinion?
A. Yes.

Q. Are these not the only facts upon which you based that opinion? Firstly, that the soil profile was as you found it and described it on page 27 of your report?
A. On page?

Q. 27.
A. 26 and 27.

Q. So your first factual basis for the opinion in relation to site 4, on the right hand page, page 27, you have described what you saw. Correct? And that's a fact.
A. Correct.

Q. You also conducted a field PH test. The result of that, you would say, is a fact?
A. Yes.

Q. It is in fact an investigational test you personally carried out? 
A. Yes.

Q. The other fact, you would say, upon which you relied, was the particle size analysis in table 3 of your report. Is that right? That's on page 28? 
A. That is another fact.

Q. But that's absolutely crucial to your opinion, isn't it? That tabulation? Table 3?
A. It is crucial, yes.

Q. You didn't carry out that analysis, did you? 
A. Not personally, no."" (underlining added)

36Mr Tulau testified that the results from the Yanco Natural Resources Laboratory were in the body of the report. They had been emailed, but the email was not included in the report. Mr Tulau said that the Yanco Laboratory was ""accredited by the National Association of Testing Authorities for enclosed tests"" (T16/2/12 p21 L40-42).

37In re-examination by Mr Glissan, the evidence given by Mr Tulau included the following (T16/2/12 p56 L24-44):

""Q. You were asked a number of questions arising out of that. I want to take you to paragraph 1 of that, and I think - but I just wonder if you can point me in you're [sic] report to when you examined this property, did you find areas transitional between clay soils and sandy soils as described in paragraph 1? 
A. Mm.

Q. You'll have to tell me.
A. Yes. The places in the report where I have done that is in the particle science analyses; also the texturing and the quantification of the course fragments, which is the basis for soil formation.

Q. Then you were asked rather a lot of questions towards the end of the cross-examination about the Blacktown mapping. I think you were at pains to say you didn't rely on the mapping, but you did rely on other things in it. What were they?
A. The soil results; the particle size analyses specifically. 

Q. You undertook two things. You took soil samples which you sent off to a laboratory. Yes?
A. Yes.""

38And at (p57 L19-36): 

""Q. In this case, did you make your own examination of the soils visually? 
A. Yes.
...
Q. You made examinations yourself?
A. Yes.

Q, Were they consistent with the results you obtained from the laboratory? 
A. Yes.""

39And at (p58 L39-41 p59 L4-11): 

""Q. How much of the analysis is done in the field and what's the relationship between the field analysis and the scientific laboratory analysis? 
A. The laboratory analysis supports- 

[objection overruled] 

Q: Continue please 
A. It supports the work done in the field. In the field, the things that you do are to texture the material, and there's certain field tests associated with texturing. What you end up with is not a numerical result in terms of sand, silt, clay and being able to accurately place it on these Marshall diagram, but rather you do get a very good result in terms of whether the material is, for example, sand or clay, and after all, in this case we are dealing with sandstone and clay or shale soils. They are chalk and cheese. You don't actually need the hard numbers. A texture will suffice to characterise the soils.""


40I turn to Ground 2 of the appeal.

Ground 2: ""The Trial Judge erred in...having found that the witness Mitchell Tulau had contravened the Expert Witness Code of Conduct in relation to his report, failing to:

consider whether the effect of the breach was to prevent the defendant from testing an aspect of the prosecution's case;

advert to the importance of the evidence adduced in breach of the code in the conclusion reached by Tulau;

consider that the breach extended to taint other conclusions expressed in the report; [and]

exclude the report from evidence"". 

The argument before the trial judge 

41The appellant contended before the trial judge that the entirety of Mr Tulau's report should not be admitted. The appellant submitted that Mr Tulau's report failed to comply with Uniform Civil Procedure Rules (2005) (UCPR) r 31.23 (1) and (3) and r 31.27(1)(f) which, shortly stated, requires compliance with the Expert Witness Code of Conduct (the Code) that is found in Schedule 7 to the UCPR. The appellant argued that Mr Tulau's report did not include any documentation from Yanco Natural Resources Laboratory, particularly the email of the Laboratory's test results of the soil samples that Mr Tulau had forwarded to the Laboratory, which Mr Tulau accepted were crucial to the conclusions that he had expressed in the report. The processes for undertaking the tests, chain of possession and the process of actual testing were not disclosed. Furthermore, there was no identification of who did the tests and their qualifications. The appellant referred to Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles [2001] NSWCA 305; (2001) 52 NSWLR 705 at [85] which required that an expert must establish the facts on which the opinion is based in order to identify a proper foundation for it. 

42The prosecutor observed that UCPR r 31.23 and r 31.27 did not apply in Class 5 proceedings in the Land and Environment Court, but Supreme Court Rules 1970 Pt 75 r 3J adopted the Code in Schedule 7. This did not exclude the making of ""an otherwise order"" in summary criminal proceedings. The prosecutor contended that Mr Tulau's report complied with cl 5 of the Code but for the possible criticism in cl (5)(1)(f) that the third party who had carried out the tests was not identified and/or its qualifications were not identified. The Prosecutor argued that the issue was, the extent to which Mr Tulau's opinion was dictated by the soil tests. 

43It is common ground in this appeal that by the operation of Supreme Court Rules Pt 75 r 3J the Code applies in criminal proceedings in the Land and Environment Court.

44The trial judge accepted that by failing to include the email of the test results of the soil particle size analyses from Yanco National Resources Laboratory and the name and qualifications of the persons undertaking the test, Mr Tulau had not complied with cl 5(1)(f) of the Code which is as follows: 

""(1) An expert's report must (in the body of the report or in an annexure to it) include the following:
...

(f) any examinations, tests or other investigations on which the expert has relied, including details of the qualifications of the person who carried them out"".

45The trial judge noted that UCPR r 31.23 and r 31.27 did not apply in Class 5 proceedings, but that Supreme Court Rules Pt 75 r 3J provides that unless the court otherwise orders experts are bound to comply with the Code. The trial judge referred to the plurality judgment (French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ) in Dasreef Pty Ltd v Hawchar [2011] HCA 21; (2011) 243 CLR 588 and to the approval in the judgment of what was said by Heydon JA in Makita at [85]. The trial judge accepted the Prosecutor's submission that Mr Tulau's report was otherwise consistent with Makita. Her Honour said in Kyluk (No 1) at [29]: 

""I consider the breach of cl 5(1)(f) of the Code while more than technical is relatively minor when considered in the overall context of the report and the oral evidence of Mr Tulau concerning his methodology. While it is necessary according to the rule to identify the individual undertaking a test at the accredited laboratory, that accreditation presumably requires appropriately qualified staff to be present and to follow established procedures for receipt and testing of soil samples. Mr Tulau specified in his report the soil analysis methodology he wanted done (Craze et al). That omission appears minor. Of possibly greater significance is the absence of documentation establishing the chain of custody of soil fragments sent to the laboratory. Mr Tulau's sworn evidence is that he collected the soil samples himself from the site. The actual results provided by the laboratory were not included in his report. It is Mr Tulau's sworn evidence that the results he received are included in his report however. The laboratory data was part of several matters considered by Mr Tulau including aerial photograph interpretation and his own weighing of soil fragments returned from the laboratory. Considering his evidence as a whole the breach of the Code is not sufficient to warrant exclusion of his whole report."" 

Submissions on appeal 

46The focus of the argument in this Court was not on compliance with the Code, but on the admissibility of the report. Mr JM Ireland QC, who appeared for the appellant, accepted that if a requirement of the Code was not followed, it did not necessarily mean that the expert's report must be excluded. 

47The appellant submitted that if evidence tendered as expert opinion is to be admitted, it must be agreed or demonstrated that so far as the opinion is based on ""assumed"" or ""accepted"" facts, they have been identified and proved in some other way. It must be established that the facts on which the opinion is based form a proper foundation for it. 

48The appellant pointed out that Mr Tulau based his opinion on soil particle analyses that he did not carry out himself and that he admitted was 'crucial' for the opinion regarding SSTF soil. The result of the crucial soil particle analysis (an email document) was not itself appended or otherwise disclosed in the report; was admitted with no evidence as to the analysis itself and was performed by an unidentified person whose qualifications as an analyst were not disclosed. The appellant argued that Mr Tulau's discussion of the results in section 7 of his report revealed that his diagrams (Figures 8 and 9) were dependent entirely upon the undisclosed hearsay particle size analysis and hearsay reports of analyses from ""similar landscapes."" It was contended that the entire basis for the conclusion that Mr Tulau draws at section 7.1 and repeats at section 8 is the triangular diagram, which was itself entirely dependent on hearsay and undisclosed particle analysis. The appellant submitted that Table 7 was corrupted in so far as it relies on the weight and size of soil fragments that had been interfered with for the purposes of the undisclosed analysis. 

49In oral submissions, Mr Ireland agreed that the appellant's complaint was two fold: (1) evidence was missing and in so far as the report depended on assumptions, those assumptions were not established by the evidence: and, (2) the report did not disclose the reasoning process in the required way. 

50Mr Glissan QC who appeared for the prosecutor before the trial judge and for the respondent upon appeal, noted that the Code itself is not a rule relating to admissibility (but rather a Code setting out what must be included in an expert report). Mr Glissan contended that any failure to comply with the Code is merely a factor to be taken into account by the court in exercising its discretion to exclude the evidence under s 135 or 137 Evidence Act 1995. He submitted that, notwithstanding that Mr Tulau was in breach of the Code by failing to include the email of the test results, there was no basis for the court exercising its discretion to exclude the report as:

(i) Mr Tulau states in the report, the methodology he adopts in carrying out his investigation;

(ii) there is a specific statement in the report that samples were submitted to Yanco Natural Resources Laboratory through a documented chain of custody. 

(iii) Mr Tulau's reliance on the soil particle analysis was not, in any event, necessary or crucial to his expert opinion. 

51In oral submissions, Mr Glissan contended that Mr Tulau's field observations were the predominant reason for his opinion as to soil type, that the laboratory soil analysis was not a fundamental premise of the opinion expressed and her Honour was correct in admitting the report. 

Decision 

52The opinion rule provides that evidence of an opinion is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact about the existence of which the opinion was expressed: s 76(1) Evidence Act. An exception to the opinion rule is found in s 79(1) Evidence Act: 

""If a person has specialised knowledge based on the person's training, study or experience, the opinion rule does not apply to evidence of an opinion of that person that is wholly or substantially based on that knowledge.""

53The plurality judgment in Dasreef Pty Ltd v Hawchar provides an authoritative statement of the principles governing s 79(1). A helpful distillation of the propositions that can be derived from the plurality judgment is provided by Sackville AJA in Nicholls & Ors v Michael Wilson & Partners Ltd [2012] NSWCA 383 at [209]:

""Section 79 assumes that opinion evidence is tendered to prove the existence of a fact. It is necessary to identify why the evidence is relevant: that is, why the evidence, if accepted, can rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of the fact in issue in the proceeding (Evidence Act, s 55(1)) (at [31]).
To be admissible under s 79(1), the evidence must satisfy two criteria. First, the witness must have specialised knowledge based on his or her training, study or experience. Secondly, the opinion expressed by the witness must be wholly or substantially based on that knowledge (at [32]).
It follows that the party tendering an expert report must demonstrate that the author has specialised knowledge based on training, study or experience that enables him or her to express an opinion on a matter that is relevant to an issue in the proceeding. The tendering party must also be able to demonstrate that the opinion was wholly or substantially based on that knowledge (at [35]).
These requirements explain why the opinion should be presented in a form which makes it possible to determine whether the opinion is wholly or substantially based on specialised knowledge (at [36], citing HG v The Queen [1999] HCA 2; 197 CLR 414, at 427, per Gleeson CJ).
Ordinarily, the evidence of the expert must explain how the field of specialised knowledge in which the witness is expert and on which the opinion is substantially based applies to facts assumed or observed to produce the opinion propounded (at [37], citing Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles [2001] NSWCA 305; 52 NSWLR 705, at [85], per Heydon JA).
A failure to demonstrate that an opinion is based on the witness's specialised knowledge based on training, study or experience is a matter that goes to the admissibility of the evidence, not its weight (at [42]).""

54In deciding to admit Mr Tulau's report, the trial judge was mindful of the principles expressed in Dasreef Pty Ltd v Hawchar. Her Honour was evidently satisfied that, in conformity with Makita at [85], Mr Tulau had identified the facts on which he based his opinion as to derivation of the soils taken from the six sites. In reaching this conclusion, her Honour took into account Mr Tulau's evidence that the laboratory tests supported the work done by him in the field to identify the texture of the soil, that his conclusions were also drawn from his own analysis of soil samples, and that in addition to the weight of the soil samples referred to in Table 7, he had weighed them, estimated their size and counted the soil fragments. Her Honour noted that, although the email of the test results of the soil particle analyses from the Yanco Natural Resources Laboratory was not annexed to the report, Mr Tulau had given evidence that the results he received from the laboratory were embodied in it. 

55In my view, the trial judge was entitled to reach that conclusion, as Mr Tulau had identified the facts and reasoning process upon which his opinions were substantially based. 

56The issues upon appeal give rise to a consideration which was not argued in any meaningful way before the trial judge, as the debate there centred upon the failure to comply with the Code. The appellant's complaint is that the respondent, by not tendering the email of the test results, the documentation as to the chain of custody and evidence as to the person who conducted the tests, had not proved the assumptions on which Mr Tulau's report rests. 

57This is an issue upon which judicial minds appear to differ. The divergence of opinion is identified by Sackville AJA in Nicholls & Ors v Michael Wilson & Partners Ltd at [242]:

""Different views have been expressed as to the consequences of the failure of a party tendering an expert's report to prove the assumptions on which the report rests. In Dasreef Pty Ltd v Hawchar, Heydon J expressed the view (at [102]) that an opinion tendered under s 79 of the Evidence Act is inadmissible unless there is evidence admitted or to be admitted before the end of the tendering party's case, capable of proving matters sufficiently similar to the assumptions to render the opinion of value. By contrast, the Court of Appeal held in a case decided four months before Dasreef Pty Ltd v Hawchar (but not referred to by Heydon J), that it is enough for an expert to identify facts and a reasoning process which he or she asserts justifies the opinion, since this allows the court to evaluate the opinions expressed: Hancock v East Coast Timber Products Pty Ltd [2011] NSWCA 11; 80 NSWLR 43, at [77], per Beazley JA (with whom Giles and Tobias JJA agreed), following Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Rich [2005] NSWCA 152; 218 ALR 764, at [105], per Spigelman CJ."" 

58In Dasreef Pty Ltd v Hawchar, Heydon J observed at [108]: 

""The ordinary meaning of s 79, taking into account its language, its context in the Act (including ss 55 - 57), the function of the Act (which is the efficient and rational regulation of trials from an evidentiary point of view), and the unreasonable results which a contrary construction would produce, is that it does not abolish the common law proof of assumption rule. Failure by the tendering party to comply with the proof of assumption rule makes the opinion evidence irrelevant."" 

59The plurality in Dasreef Pty Ltd v Hawchar did not expressly refer to ""the assumption rule"", but discussed ""the basis rule"" at [41]: 

""Contrary to submissions on behalf of Mr Hawchar, this analysis does not seek to introduce what has been called ""the basis rule"": a rule by which opinion evidence is to be excluded unless the factual bases upon which the opinion is proffered are established by other evidence. Whether that rule formed part of the common law of evidence need not be examined. It may be accepted that the Law Reform Commission's interim report on evidence denied the existence of such a common law rule and expressed the intention to refrain from including a basis rule in the legislation the Commission proposed and which was later enacted as the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) and the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW)"" (footnote omitted).

60In Hancock v East Coast Timber Products Pty Ltd, Beazley JA said at [77]-[78]:

""Spigelman CJ's analysis in ASIC v Rich of Heydon JA's reasoning in Makita concluded that it conforms with the statement of Gleeson CJ in HG, at [39], set out at [72] above. As Spigelman CJ stated, at [105]: 

""Although expressed in terms of 'usefulness', the starting point for Heydon JA's detailed analysis of the case law on admissibility does not suggest any focus on the true historical process by which the expert first formed the relevant opinion. The focus of attention - the 'prime duty' - is to ensure that the court, as the tribunal of fact, is placed in a position where it can examine and assess the evidence presented to it. That can occur without adopting the true factual basis approach . What Heydon JA identified as the expert's 'prime duty' is fully satisfied if the expert identifies the facts and reasoning process which he or she asserts justify the opinion. That is sufficient to enable the tribunal of fact to evaluate the opinions expressed."" (emphasis added) 

I accept this analysis, which I consider to be clearly correct."" 

61I do not think that it is appropriate to attempt to resolve this apparent conflict as the Court has not had the benefit of detailed submissions on this issue. In any event, it is not necessary to do so. Although there is no rule that precludes the admissibility of expert evidence that fails to comply with the Expert Witness Code, the Code remains relevant when considering the exclusionary rules under ss 135-137 Evidence Act: Wood v R [2012] NSWCCA 21 at [729]. Furthermore, even if an opinion based on assumed but unproven facts is admissible, the opinion may be given little or no weight if the assumption is not made good by the evidence: Ramsay v Watson [1961] HCA 65; (1961) 108 CLR 642.

62It appears from the reasons of the trial judge that she considered that she had a discretion to admit the report where there was a breach of cl 5(1)(f) of the Code. The parties had accepted that her Honour had the power to make an ""otherwise order."" This concession seems to have been derived from Supreme Court Rules Pt 75 r 3J(3) and UCPR r 31.23, although it is not entirely clear from the transcript. Whilst that might be so, her Honour in exercising that discretion did not turn her mind to ss 135-137 Evidence Act. 

63Section 135 Evidence Act relevantly provides:

""The court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might 

(a) be unfairly prejudicial to a party..."" 

64The term ""probative value"" is defined in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act as follows: 

""probative value of evidence means the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue."" 

65Mr Tulau gave evidence that the particle size analyses was crucial to the opinions expressed in the report. Although he moved from that position when questioned by Mr Glissan, it is plain from the report that he had relied on the laboratory analyses in conjunction with his observations in the field and the analyses were basic to the questions on which he had been asked to provide expert opinions. Furthermore, there was no documentation that established the chain of possession from collection of the soil samples by Mr Tulau to analysis in the laboratory. It seems to me that in the absence of the email from the laboratory, some evidence as to qualifications of the person or persons conducting the tests and documentation establishing the chain of possession that the extent to which Mr Tulau's evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue was not much. 

66On the other hand, without the material from the laboratory being in evidence, the appellant could not evaluate and test the cogency of the conclusions expressed by Mr Tulau and was unfairly disadvantaged. The breach of the Code by Mr Tulau was not relatively minor. 

67The trial judge did not have regard to the unfair prejudice to the appellant that might arise from the admission into evidence of Mr Tulau's report nor did she undertake the weighing exercise that s 135 Evidence Act requires. In my respectful opinion, when exercising the discretion to admit the report, her Honour fell into an error of a kind that is reviewable in accordance with the principles in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499. 

68I conclude that the probative value of Mr Tulau's report is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial to the appellant. In my view, her Honour should have refused to admit the report. 

69I would uphold Ground 2 of the appeal. 

70The appellant complains in Ground 3 that the trial judge erred ""in failing to hold that the opinion of Mitchell Tulau was so qualified as to be incapable of proving to the criminal standard that the soil type purportedly occurring at locus in quo was soil essential to the identification of the Endangered Ecological Community as SSTF."" My conclusion in respect of the second ground of appeal makes it unnecessary to consider this issue at any length. It is sufficient to say that I do not consider that there is any substance in the appellant's complaint. 

71Ground 4: ""The Trial Judge erred in...admitting into evidence the expert report of Teresa James, which was inadmissible by reason of its reliance upon/incorporation of earlier reports she prepared, that were not in evidence"".

72The appellant contended that the only report prepared by Ms James that contains her undertaking to be bound by the Code is TAJ-5 to the affidavit of 24 November 2011. The appellant submitted that TAJ-5 is expressly supplementary to the three earlier reports Ms James prepared for Campbelltown City Council and is to be read in conjunction with the earlier reports in which she did not consider herself bound by Schedule 7. Ms James' subsequent reports rely on opinions formed when she did not turn her attention to the Code. The appellant argued that the Code may not be ""adopted"" ex post facto in circumstances where it was not taken into consideration in preparing earlier reports. 

73The respondent submitted that Ms James' reports, being TAJ-5 and 
TAJ-7 stood alone and were admissible. 

Decision 

74Ms James had prepared three reports for Campbelltown City Council (the Council) in relation to the picking of SSTF on the property (TAJ-3, TAJ-4 and TAJ-6). Ms James was subsequently engaged by the respondent as an expert witness in the prosecution of the appellant. For that purpose, she prepared two reports (TAJ-5 and TAJ-7).

75Unsurprisingly, the three reports prepared for the Council did not contain an acknowledgment by Ms James that she was bound by the Code. During her testimony on the voir dire, Ms James said that she did not consider herself bound by the Code when preparing the reports for the Council. 

76Ms James evidence on this topic included the following (T16/02/12 p72 L2-12):

""Q. So insofar as those two reports were directed to the Campbelltown Council, they're not compliant with the Code. 
A. That's correct 

Q. You didn't intend them to be. 
A. No, I wouldn't have done anything different. I -- 

Q. I didn't ask you that, you didn't consider yourself bound by the code because you weren't 
A. That wasn't - yes, that's correct.""

77Mr Littlemore informed the trial judge in submissions on the voir dire that his attack was upon TAJ-5 and that TAJ-7 ""would stand on its own two feet"" (T17/02/12 p122 L35-46). 

78The Code did not apply to the reports prepared for the Council as they were preliminary reports and the Council did not prosecute the appellant, but the respondent did. In any event, on the day after the voir dire was conducted, Mr Glissan told the trial judge that the prosecution withdrew the three Council reports. 

79In both of the reports prepared for the prosecution (TAJ-5, TAJ-7), Ms James stated that she had read the Code and agreed to be bound by it. In an affidavit, Ms James confirmed that in preparing the reports she had abided by the requirements of the Code. 

80The controversy is said by the appellant to arise as Ms James stated in TAJ-5 that ""this supplementary report should be read in conjunction with the above reports."" The ""above reports"" are the three reports to the Council that were withdrawn. 

81The trial judge did not expressly deal with the question of an ex post facto adoption of the Code, but considered that Ms James' report (TAJ-5) could be read ""as a stand alone report when viewed in its entirety."" Her Honour's finding was clearly correct as the report identified the methodology used, the site inspections undertaken, the facts upon which Ms James' opinion was based, the references relied on and contained an annexure of the results and data collected by her during the inspections that she carried out to prepare the report. 

82It is plain that when Ms James prepared reports TAJ-5 and TAJ-7, she firmly had in mind the Code when referring to the material in the reports to the Council. She was not merely ""rubbing stamping"" these reports: Hodder Rook & Associates Pty Ltd v Genworth Financial Mortgage Insurance Pty Ltd [2011] NSWCA 279 per Young JA at [63]. 

83I would reject Ground 4 of the appeal. 

Ground 5: ""The Trial Judge erred in...admitting into evidence as expert opinion the opinion of Teresa James concerning the area of land cleared when that area had not been the subject of Theresa James' own investigation and calculation"". 

84The appellant raised various matters in support of this ground. The appellant submitted that Ms James' opinion as to the area of the property cleared, when that area had not been the subject of her own investigation and calculation, is shown to be unsatisfactory, by the fact that she (AWS p 13-14):

""(a) did not attempt to record transects as to the locations of observations;

(b) relied on the NPWS map (2002) that has not been independently proved, and she admits that it is merely indicative;

(c) failed to disclose her reasoning in relation to the weight placed on various sources;

(d) failed to disclose her reliance on a document created by Byrne with figures, and misleadingly passed the figure off as her own opinion;

(e) failed to document, or even refer to in her report, the location of the ""meandering transects."" She said that this was because it was not an ""established project"" requiring ""detailed information"". This might be understandable in relation to a report for Campbelltown Council, but not for a criminal prosecution. 

(f) failed to refer to the qualifications to her opinion necessitated by her concessions as to the ""preliminary look"" and the absence of any perceived need for ""detailed information"".

(g) failed to set out her reasoning for making any of the various ""rough estimates"" of area in her reports."" (transcript references omitted)

85During the voir dire, Mr Littlemore's principal attack upon TAJ-5 was the use made by Ms James of the measurements made by Jennifer Byrne. 

86In par 3.2 of the report (TAJ-5), Ms James wrote: 

""...The area of each community pre-clearing is now more accurately calculated with information from soil analysis and GIS mapping by Jennifer Byrne of DECCW. The area of Shale Sandstone Transition Forest cleared is estimated to be 12.54 ha and Cumberland Plain Woodland 3.6 ha."" 

87In cross-examination by Mr Littlemore, Ms James' evidence on this topic included the following (T16/02/12 p93 L25-35):

""Q. ... How do you know that the area of the community is more accurately calculated than previously by Ms Byrne?
A. Its just a matter of calculation on the GIS, because I actually gave the mapping of the extent of the shale/sandstone transition forest to Ms Byrne, and it's just a case of calculating it on the computer. So there was no - from my point of view, I was showing the same extent of clearly, it's just the calculation was more accurate because it was done through a GIS rather than using a ruler on a map.""

88Ms James in further evidence said that in her original report, she had identified the area of SSTF cleared as being 15 hectares, but had updated it with ""a more accurate calculation, because it uses a GIS instead of a ruler and a topographical map"" (T16/02/12 p97 L1-8). Ms James appended the map (annexure 6) to her report.

89Mr Littlemore was critical of Ms James' estimate of the extent of SSTF that had been cleared. He argued that it was not Ms James' estimate, but Ms James had claimed it was an estimate made by Ms Byne and there was no evidence that it was. 

90The trial judge rejected the appellant's argument. Her Honour said in Kyluk (No 1) at [33]: 

""The adoption of Ms Byrne's opinion as to the area of EEC cleared estimated as 12.54 ha in par 7.2 as Ms James' own was heavily criticised by the Defendant as being misleading. I considered the criticism of the report in this regard was adopting a fine-tooth comb approach to the report which is not justified simply because these are criminal proceedings. Ms James' approach is entirely understandable when other sections of the report are given a fair reading. These refer to Ms Byrne's annexure 6 where figures for the area cleared are shown and identify that Ms Byrne did the GIS calculation for those areas (par 3.2). When read in context it is clear that Ms James is adopting that figure as the approximate area. It is Ms James' lines on the aerial photograph of where clearing occurred which informs the mathematical calculation carried out by Ms Byrne using a GIS system. According to Ms James' oral evidence this method is more accurate than her method of using a ruler and topographical map to calculate the area cleared. There is no criticism of the identification of the lines on the Fig 1 and 2 prepared by Ms James. This criticism of the report is not sustained."" 





Decision 

91In this court, Mr Ireland accepted that the criticism of Ms James' reliance on Ms Byrnes was the appellant's ""weakest point"" and did not advance any argument in support of the written submissions. 

92Ms James evinced in the report (TAJ-5) and her oral evidence the methodology that she adopted to estimate and calculate the area of SSTF cleared. She had inspected the property on two occasions including a five hour foot survey in December 2010. Ms James prepared mapping (Figures 1 and 2 TAJ-5) from which she estimated the extent of the area of SSTF that was cleared. Ms James provided the mapping to Ms Byrne who, using a geographic information system (""GIS""), calculated the area of SSTF cleared to be 12.54 hectares. Ms James appended the map produced by Ms Byrnes (annexure 6) to the report.

93I do not think that the appellant's complaint has been made out. The trial judge did not err in admitting the report. I would reject Ground 5 of the appeal. 

94I turn now to those grounds of appeal that relate to the question of construction of the final determination of the Scientific Committee. 

Ground 1: ""The Trial Judge erred in...holding that the evidence was capable of proving to the criminal standard that a definite area of land meeting the definition of Shale Sandstone Transition Forest (SSTF) had been picked"".

Ground 7: ""The Trial Judge erred in...failing to identify correctly/with certainty the essential elements of the definition of Shale Sandstone Transition Forest formulated by the Scientific Committee"".

Ground 12: ""The Trial Judge erred in...making a remediation order in the absence of admissible evidence identifying the extent of the relevant area"". 

95It is convenient to deal with these grounds of appeal together. 

96The appellant submitted that upon a textual analysis of the Scientific Committee's final determination for SSTF both flora and soil components are necessary elements of SSTF. The appellant pointed out that harming a community of SSTF attracts serious penalties and the final determination should be read so it is sufficiently precise to enable proof of its characteristics beyond reasonable doubt. This Courts' attention was drawn to par 3 of the final determination and the word ""otherwise"" which was said to indicate that were it not for the presence of some other characteristic, the flora would not define SSTF, because the assemblage may present in, and define other ecological communities. The appellant contended that the only other characteristic referred to in the basic definition in par 1 of the final determination is the soil profile and the identification of flora alone in an area will not be sufficient to make a finding beyond reasonable doubt that SSTF existed there. 

97The appellant's argument is that the prosecution was required to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the species of tree that had been picked by the appellant not only was of a character that was within the assemblage of species identified in par 4 of the final determination but was growing on soils that are transitional between the clay soils derived from Wianamatta Shale and the sandy soils derived from Hawkesbury Sandstone. 

98Should the appellant's construction of the final determination be correct, then the trial judge's finding that the extent of the area of SSTF that had been cleared by the appellant was 12.54 hectares cannot be supported as Mr Tulau's report confined the area of transitional soils to approximately 5 hectares. Furthermore, in light of my view that the Tulau report should not have been admitted, the primary judge could not have been satisfied to the criminal standard as to the cleared area of SSTF.

99The trial judge rejected the appellant's argument in Kyluk (No 3) at [87]-[92]. Her Honour found:

(i) The final determination ""should not be read with the precision expected of a document drafted by Parliamentary counsel (as it was not so drafted) and must be considered in light of the subject matter it is considering, namely ecological communities which do not have precise boundaries"" (Kyluk (No 3) [89]). Her Honour cited Hodgson JA in Vaw (Kurri Kurri) Pty Ltd v Scientific Committee [2003] NSWCA 297; (2003) 58 NSWLR 631 at [234] where his Honour recognised: 

""...that a certain amount of vagueness and uncertainty in the determination of boundaries of ecological communities is an inevitable result of the formulations chosen by the legislature...""

(ii) Paragraph 1 of the final determination is not the only paragraph defining SSTF and the document must be read as a whole. Her Honour said at [91]-[92]: 

""...Paragraphs 3 - 8 deal with flora and refer to ""characterised by"" in par, 3, 4 and 5. Variation in composition across sites is recognised. Which plant species can be part of a SSTF stand are identified (par 4), which tree species are characteristic of the SSTF are identified (par 5) and which plant specifies of SSTF provide habitat for protected species are identified (par 8). Paragraph 7 identifies that species composition will vary between sites depending on geographical location. 

Paragraphs 9, 10 and 12 refer to soil. Paragraph 9 should be read as part of the locational definition of SSTF. It includes the words ""generally occurs on soils"". Paragraph 10 refers to SSTF occurring at the margins of shale cappings over sandstone, language which does not suggest a precisely defined boundary...The imprecise language in par 9, 10 and 12 further supports a finding that the Final Determination recognises that the SSTF will not have precisely defined boundaries in terms of both soil and vegetation. A reading of the Final Determination as a whole does not require that flora which meets the description of the Final Determination must be located precisely on the specified soil type in order to meet the definition of SSTF in the Final Determination in par 1 and beyond."" 

(iii) Ms James' evidence established beyond reasonable doubt that the area of SSTF that had been cleared by the defendant. Her Honour accepted Ms James' opinion that the floristic character of SSTF was the ""dominant characteristic rather than the soil type.""

100During her testimony on the voir dire, Ms James expressed the view that ""[t]he line where the vegetation boundaries are doesn't have to be the same as where the soil boundaries are"" (T16/02/12 p84 L32-35). Ms James agreed that what she had said was ""definitely very fuzzy"", but went on to say (T16/02/12 p84 L40-45):

""...the floristic evidence is the primary evidence that I used to establish the extent of the communities."" 

101Ms James expressed the opinion that the floristic evidence ""is also the primary emphasis in the final determination"" (T16/02/12 p84 L44). 

102The respondent submitted that the trial judge correctly found that SSTF will not have precisely defined boundaries in terms of soil. The respondent contended that it would be an improper approach in interpreting paragraph 1 of the final determination to require that the ecological community be located on soils derived from both Wianamatta Shale and Hawkesbury Sandstone, as paragraphs 9 and 10 state that SSTF generally (but not always) occurs on soils derived from clay and sandstone and are generally close to the boundary between Wianamatta Shale and Hawkesbury Sandstone. The requirement is merely that the SSTF is on areas transitional between clay and sandstone soils. The respondent pointed to the words ""generally occurs on soils..."" in par 9 which was said to indicate that SSTF generally occurs on soils of a certain type but may also occur on soils of other types. 

103The respondent submitted that her Honour's finding that the floristic elements will be the final or principal determinant of the identification of and boundary of SSTF was correct. Mr Glissan argued that ""as long as the floristic elements occurred within a general area which contained the transitional material relied on by Mr Tulau, then the clear proper construction when one reads the whole of the Scientific Committee's final determination enables a conclusion that the dominant characteristic is to be determined by the combination of floristic elements in the area"" (T07/03/13 p20 L26-31).

Decision 

104In criminal proceedings, facts that are taken into account in a way adverse to the interests of an accused must be established beyond reasonable doubt: The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; (1999) 199 CLR 270.

105During submissions in this Court, Mr Glissan suggested that the precise determination of the area that had been cleared did not have any material impact on the sentence imposed by the trial judge. This submission is readily rejected as her Honour took into account the finding that approximately 12.54 hectares had been cleared in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence, the harm that had been caused, the amount of the payment for restoration works, and the extent of the area to be remediated. 

106An endangered ecological community is defined in s 4 of the Threatened Species Conservation Act to be an ecological community specified in Part 3 of Schedule 1 of that Act. SSTF is specified in Part 3 of Schedule 1. This endangered ecological community is stated to be ""as described in the final determination of the Scientific Committee to list the ecological community."" The prosecution was required to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the area cleared by the appellant was an endangered ecological community of SSTF as described in the final determination of the Scientific Committee. 

107The trial judge recognised that the prosecutor bore the onus of establishing to the criminal standard the extent of the area that had been cleared. When her Honour cited what was said by Hodgson JA in Vaw (Kurri Kurri) Pty Ltd v Scientific Committee at [234], she expressly stated that unlike VAW , the present case was a criminal one that required proof beyond reasonable doubt. 

108VAW concerned the validity of a determination of the Scientific Committee pursuant to s 23 of the Threatened Species Conservation Act (1995). The case did not involve a prosecution under the NPW Act or the proper construction of the Scientific Committee's final determination on SSTF. However, the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in VAW provides guidance in the approach to be taken to the final determination. 

109Hodgson JA recognised that uncertainty in the determination of boundaries may raise difficulties for persons in considering what to do about plants or animals of particular species in areas that may or may not be occupied by an EEC. His Honour said at [238]: 

""...However, these difficulties are necessarily involved in the way the legislation has been framed. It may be possible that hardship will be avoided by consideration of the element of mens rea involved in s.118A offences: there may for example be recognised a defence to the effect that the person in question reasonably believed that the species being dealt with was not part of an endangered ecological community.""

110In referring to VAW, her Honour did not mention Spigelman CJ's opinion that it was necessary to imply a requirement of reasonable certainty in a final determination of the Scientific Committee because of the potential for criminal prosecutions. The Chief Justice said at [6]:

""It is the consequences of the exercise of the Scientific Committee's listing power for those who may become subject to the associated offences found in other legislation, namely the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974, as set out by Hodgson JA, that render it necessary to imply a requirement of reasonable certainty. People should know when they are, or are likely to be, at hazard of committing an offence."" 

111Although there will necessarily be some uncertainty in determining the boundaries of ecological communities, it is plainly of importance that the circumstances of a potential breach of the NPW Act be readily ascertainable as persons are exposed to criminal prosecutions. The adoption of such an approach to the construction of the final determination is informed by the rule that if the language of a criminal statute remains ambiguous or doubtful, the ambiguity or doubt is resolved in favour of the subject by refusing to extend the category of criminal offence: Beckwith v The Queen (1976) 135 CLR 569 at 576; Waugh v Kippen [1986] HCA 12; (1986) 160 CLR 156 at 164.

112The trial judge accepted Ms James evidence that the ""dominant characteristic"" was the ""floristic character"" of SSTF. The final determination in its terms does not mention dominant or subordinate characteristics. The description of SSTF in paragraph 1 (see [19] above) has as its characteristics; an assemblage of plant species listed in paragraph 4 ('the flora') and soils that are transitional between the clay soils derived from Wianamatta Shale and the sandy soils derived from Hawkesbury Sandstone ('transitional soil'). 'The flora' and 'transitional soil' are located within the Sydney Basin Bioregion. 

113To subscribe to the flora a dominant characteristic in construing the description of SSTF, in my opinion, detracts from the requirement of reasonable certainty. By way of illustration, the assemblage of species that characterise SSTF include eight species that also characterise CPW. In respect of those species that characterise both SSTF and CPW, the distinguishing feature is the soil constituent as CPW ""is the accepted name for the plant community that occurs on soils derived from shale on the Cumberland Plain"": (Cumberland Plain Woodland endangered ecological community listing: NSW Scientific Committee - final determination of 13/06/97, par 1). 

114The final determination recognises that flora does not alone determine what is SSTF. Paragraph 3 provides that ""the floristic composition of the community includes species otherwise characteristic of, or occurring in, either sandstone or shale habitats"" (italics added). The word ""otherwise"" indicates that were it not for the presence of some other characteristic, the flora would not define SSTF, because the assemblage may present in, and define other ecological communities, such as CPW. The only other characteristic in the description in paragraph 1 of the final determination is the 'transitional soil'. 

115A further indication of the role 'transitional soil' plays in determining whether the 'flora' is SSTF is found in paragraph 12, which provides that ""adjacent communities on shale soils are generally Cumberland Plain Woodland, while adjacent communities on sandstone soils are generally part of the Sydney Sandstone complex."" Paragraph 12 indicates that if soils are shale, or sandstone, the floristic communities present on them will not be SSTF - they will be different communities even though they are located next to each other. 

116Some argument was directed to the meaning of the words ""occurs on areas"" in paragraph 1 of the final determination. It was the respondent's case that the preferred interpretation should be ""in the region of"" so that if it was established that the flora occurred in the region of, but not necessarily on transitional soil, it would be SSTF. In my view, the respondent's approach is not supported by paragraph 12, nor does it promote the objective of reasonable certainty. 

117I do not think that the respondent's submission that paragraph 9 may be taken to indicate that SSTF may also occur on soils other than transitional soils is correct. Paragraph 9 is as follows:

""SSTF generally occurs on soils derived from a shallow shale or clay material overlying sandstone, or where shale-derived materials has washed down over sandstone-derived substrate. Such sites are generally close to the geological boundary between the Wianamatta Shale and Hawkesbury Sandstone."" 

118In my opinion, paragraph 9 provides an explanation as to how soil containing shale and sandstone (transitional soils) are generally derived and where such sites are generally located. It does not extend the description of SSTF to flora located upon soils other than transitional soils. 

119Paragraph 10 does no more than describe the topographical features where SSTF will be found being ""on plateaux and hillsides and at the margins of shale cappings over sandstone."" Paragraph 10 is to be read with paragraph 1 which locates SSTF as being within the Sydney Basin Bioregion and paragraph 2 as occurring in the various Local Government Areas that are identified. 

120I conclude that there are no ""dominant"" or ""subordinate"" characteristics in the final determination. The characteristics of flora, transitional soil and location are interlinked and must be present. A similar analysis was adopted in Gale Holdings Pty Limited v Tweed Shire Council [2008] NSWLEC 209, a civil case, where Preston CJ considered the final determination of the Scientific Committee to list Freshwater Wetlands. His Honour said at [64]: 

""This description has three components that are linked: an edaphic (soil) component (""silts, muds or humic loams""), a topographical component (""depressions, flats, drainage lines, backswamps, lagoons and lakes"") and a locational component (""associated with coastal floodplains"")...""

121It seems to me that in order to establish that the area cleared by the appellant was an endangered ecological community of SSTF as described in the final determination, the prosecution was required to prove beyond reasonable doubt not only that the trees fell within the assemblage of plant species listed in the final determination, but also that those trees had been growing on soils that were transitional between the clay soils derived from Wianamatta Shale and sandy soils derived from Hawkesbury Sandstone. 

122I should mention that the evidentiary provisions of s 197(2A) of the NPW Act do not apply as there was no allegation in the summons of the extent of the area of SSTF that had been cleared. 

123In my respectful opinion, her Honour's construction of the final determination was incorrect. Furthermore, the evidence was not capable of establishing to the criminal standard that 12.54 hectares of SSTF had been cleared by the appellant. 

124I would uphold Grounds 1, 7 and 12 of the appeal. 

125Having reached these conclusions on the principal grounds of appeal, it is unnecessary to deal with the remaining grounds which essentially focus on the question of the severity of the sentence that was imposed, save for Ground 8 which raises a matter of principle. 

Ground 8: ""The Trial Judge erred in...erroneously attributing to the defendant actual foresight that harm to the environment would result from clearing or picking of the land in issue"". 

126One of the matters a court, in imposing a penalty for an offence under the NPW Act or the regulations, is required to take into consideration is found in s 194(1)(d) of the NPW Act. Section 194(1)(d) relevantly provides: 

""In imposing a penalty for an offence under this Act or the regulations, the court is to take into consideration the following (so far as they are relevant):

...

(d) the extent to which the person who committed the offence could reasonably have foreseen the harm caused or likely to be caused by the commission of the offence.""

127The trial judge found that the extent of harm arising from the clearing undertaken was foreseeable. Her Honour said in Kyluk (No 3) at [105]: 

""The extent of harm arising from the clearing undertaken was foreseeable. The photographs taken after the clearing and presented by the Prosecutor identify the extensive clearing of all storeys of vegetation with lengthy windrows created with the fallen trees. As summarised at par 13 - 23 above, the resulting harm identified by Ms James includes erosion, weed invasion, loss of diversity of species, inter alia. Mr Winch's evidence at par 29 above is that he identified weeds on the cleared land. The Defendant criticised the Prosecutor for relying on a reasonable person test in relation to foreseeability of harm submitting that did not satisfy the proof beyond reasonable doubt required in a criminal case. I am not sure how foreseeability of harm which is inherently a future possibility rather than a certainty at the time the offence is committed, which the statute requires to be considered in sentencing, can be proved beyond reasonable doubt in a literal sense. Common sense which can be another way of considering what a reasonable person would consider foreseeable suggests that clearing all vegetation on a sloping site (par 25 above) will lead to environmental harm such as erosion and weed invasion in the absence of adequate remedial measures. Ms James' evidence is that actual harm has eventuated. The proof of foreseeability of harm in these criminal proceedings can be met by the application of both common sense it is reasonable to expect of a landholder and the expert opinion of Ms James to the facts of this case.""

128The appellant complained that the trial judge's approach is inconsistent with s 194(1)(d) as her Honour had apparently adopted the prosecutor's submissions that a reasonable person would as a matter of ""common sense"" foresee that harm would be caused by the clearing that occurred. The appellant submitted that the test is not whether in the abstract any harm to the environment was objectively foreseeable as the words ""the person who committed the offence"" in s 194(1)(d) directed attention to the offender's subjective situation. The appellant argued that by not adverting to the individual circumstances of the appellant, and what was or was not reasonable for him to have foreseen, involved a departure from the language of the statute. 

129On the other hand, the respondent submitted that in considering 
s 194(1)(d), a court is not required to look at the extent of an offender's ""actual knowledge"" in causing harm, but directs attention to the extent to which an offender ""could reasonably have foreseen the harm."" The respondent put to this Court that ""it was proper for [her Honour] to consider foreseeability in the context of what a reasonable person in the shoes of the Appellant would have done in response to the foreseeable risks that arise from the clearing of vegetation, such as the potential to cause erosion, loss of species etc"" (RWS par 86). 

Decision 

130Section 194(1)(d) is neither exclusively dependant upon the actual knowledge of an offender nor the objective circumstances of the offending. The question that must be asked is to what extent (if any) a reasonable person in the position of the offender could have foreseen the harm caused or likely to be caused by the commission of the offence? 

131The position of the offender involves a consideration of all the available evidence including what the offender actually knew or ought reasonably to have known that was relevant to the issue of the foreseeability of the harm caused or likely to be caused. 

132In the passage quoted at [127] above, the trial judge did not make any reference to the evidence that was available as to the appellant's position, but appears to have confined her consideration to the objective circumstances of the harm. In so doing, her Honour, in my respectful opinion, erred. Her Honour also referred to the standard of proof. Reasonable foreseeability of the harm caused or likely to be caused is a factor that increases the objective seriousness of the offence: Camilleri's Stock Feeds P/L v EPA (1993) 32 NSWLR 683. Accordingly, it must be established beyond reasonable doubt: The Queen v Olbrich. 

133For these reasons, I would uphold Ground 8 of the appeal. 

134This Court is unable on the material before it to pass another sentence in substitution of the sentence that is to be quashed. There is no alternative but to return the matter to the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales. 














Orders

135Accordingly, I propose the following orders: 

1. Leave to appeal granted. 

2. Appeal against sentence allowed. 

3. Quash the penalty imposed and other orders made by Pain J on 20 March 2012. 

4. Remit the matter to the Land and Environment Court of New South 
Wales to be dealt with in accordance with these reasons. 

136McCALLUM J: I have had the benefit of reading in draft the judgment of Price J and the additional remarks of Schmidt J. I agree with Price J that the appeal should be allowed, substantially for the reasons stated by his Honour. I also agree with the additional remarks of Schmidt J, subject to one qualification. 

137Price J considers that the trial judge was entitled to reach the conclusion that the report of Mr Tulau was admissible (at [55]), but concludes that the probative value of Mr Tulau's report was substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial to the appellant (at [68]) and that her Honour should accordingly have refused to admit the report under s135 of the Evidence Act 1995. In fairness to the learned sentencing judge, it is not clear to me whether the matter was argued on that basis in the Court below. It does not appear to have been put in those terms in oral submissions, but there were also written submissions which are not before this Court. In any event, I agree with his Honour's conclusion as to s135 and would add that, since the proceedings were criminal proceedings, it follows that the exclusion of the report was mandated by s137 of the Act. 

138Schmidt J considers that the report was inadmissible. I agree with her Honour's analysis of the principles informing the issue of when opinion evidence should be excluded for want of proof of a fact assumed or accepted by the expert as a premise of the opinion. I am less confident in reaching a view as to whether, on the proper application of those principles, Mr Tulau's report was inadmissible in the present case. Although he acceded in cross-examination to the proposition that the particle size analysis undertaken by a third party was ""crucial"" to his opinion, he appeared to resile from that concession in re-examination and to put forward a more robust defence of his position (at T20.26 and T59.4). The trial judge was better placed to assess the impact of that evidence on the basis for the opinions expressed in the report. However, it is not necessary for me to decide that issue.

139I agree with the orders proposed by Price J.

140SCHMIDT J: I have had the benefit of reading Price J's decision and agree with the orders which his Honour proposes. I agree with his Honour's conclusion that Mr Tulau's report was wrongly admitted, but wish to add some observations in relation to grounds 2 and 3 of the appeal.

141The case proceeded in an unusual way. A plea was entered before any facts were agreed and before the prosecutor's position in relation to various relevant matters were seemingly clarified. At the hearing, there was a dispute about a statement of facts, which the prosecutor, the respondent in these proceedings, sought to tender. The appellant also objected to the expert evidence on which the prosecutor sought to rely. 

142Mr Tulau had been engaged to investigate the soil types present at the site, described in the summons as the ""place of offence"". His opinions were directed to the extent of transitional soil at the site. That was a fact in issue relevant to a consideration of the nature and seriousness of the offence for which the appellant was being sentenced. 

143At the sentencing hearing the appellant's objection to Mr Tulau's report did not go to the question of his specialised knowledge based on his training, study or experience, or to the question of whether the opinions which he expressed in his report were wholly or substantially based on that knowledge. Mr Tulau's opinions rested in large part on the results of the analysis of soil samples which he had gathered at the site. It was he who had commissioned that analysis from the Department's Yanco Natural Resources Laboratory. His report did not, however, reveal what tests the Laboratory had undertaken in relation to the soil or by whom; or anything as to the chain of possession of the samples. All that was revealed was the results which Mr Tulau had received and how he used those results, in reaching the conclusions that he came to.

144It was not suggested that Mr Tulau himself had specialised knowledge in the soil analysis which he had the Laboratory undertake, but that he had expertise in the use which could be made of the results of such analysis, was not questioned. The tender of his report was objected to, however, because of his failure to comply with the requirements of the Expert Witness Code of Conduct, which required that his report identify:

""(f) any examinations, tests or other investigations on which the expert has relied, including details of the qualifications of the person who carried them out ... ""


145There was no explanation given for that failure. The trial judge considered that the failure was a minor one; that she had a discretion to admit the report despite that failure; and that in the circumstances, the discretion should be exercised in favour of its admission. Those conclusions were challenged on appeal, where it was also argued that the report was not admissible. 

146Contrary to her Honour's conclusions, the failure to adhere to the Code was plainly an important one in the circumstances, given the nature of the charges for which the appellant was being sentenced and the role which the results of the analysis of the soil samples had played in the opinions which Mr Tulau had reached, as to the extent of the transitional soil at the site. 

147A failure to adhere to the Code was recently considered in Wood v R [2012] NSWCCA 21, where it was observed:

""728 It may be, as some previous decisions suggest, that an expert's evidence is not inadmissible merely because the expert has breached or overlooked the Expert Witness Code of Conduct: United Rural Enterprises Pty Ltd v Lopmand Pty Ltd [2003] NSWSC 870 at [12] (Campbell J); Rich at [333] (Austin J); Stamoulis at [208] (Ipp JA, Beazley and Giles JJA agreeing); see Commonwealth Development Bank of Australia Pty Ltd v Cassegrain [2002] NSWSC 980 at [9] (Einstein J). This position accords with the view that bias is ""no reason not to admit evidence of [the] expert"": Li v The Queen (2003) 139 A Crim R 281; [2003] NSWCCA 290 at [71] (Ipp JA, Whealy and Howie JJ agreeing); see also Haoui v R [2008] NSWCCA 209 at [127]. It also aligns with the reality that ""[h]owever desirable these new rules and protocols [contained in expert witness codes of conduct] may be, they cannot establish changes to the principles underlying the law of evidence"": FGT Custodians Pty Ltd v Fagenblat [2003] VSCA 33 at [15] (Ormiston JA, Chernov and Eames JJA agreeing). 

729 This is not to say that the Expert Witness Code of Conduct is merely aspirational. Where an expert commits a sufficiently grave breach of the Code, a court may be justified in exercising its discretion to exclude the evidence under ss 135 or 137 of the Evidence Act . Campbell J adverted to this possibility in Lopmand when his Honour stated at [15]: ""The policy which underlies the existence of Part 36 rule 13C is one which I should take into account in deciding whether [the expert evidence] should be rejected under section 135."" I respectfully agree with that approach. While there is no rule that precludes the admissibility of expert evidence that fails to comply with the Code, the Code is relevant when considering the exclusionary rules in ss 135-137 of the Evidence Act . The expert's ""failure to understand his [or her] responsibilities as an expert"" ( Lopmand at [19]) may result in the probative value of the evidence being substantially outweighed by the danger that it might mislead or confuse or be unfairly prejudicial to a party.""


148In this case, the trial judge did not exclude the report by exercise of the discretion given by s 135 of the Evidence Act. For reasons which Price J has given, her Honour erred in that regard. If admissible, the report should have been excluded under s 135 as being unfairly prejudicial. 

149As to the admissibility of the report, the argument advanced in written submissions for the appellant was that because the Laboratory reports were facts which Mr Tulau had 'assumed' or 'accepted' in reaching his opinions, his evidence had to explain how his specialised knowledge, on which the opinions he expressed were based, applied to the facts assumed, so as to produce the opinion he propounded (see HG v R [1999] HCA 2; (1999) 197 CLR 414 at [41]). If no evidence was led to establish the basis for the opinion, it was not possible to assess whether the opinion was capable of affecting the probability of the existence of a fact in issue and so the report was not admissible. 

150In oral submissions it was argued that the soil analysis involved testing critical to the conclusions which Mr Tulau had come to. Unless the evidence explained what had been done to protect the integrity of the samples sent for analysis; what test was ordered; what testing of the samples had been undertaken and by whom, his report could not be admitted. There was an email to which Mr Tulau referred in his evidence, but it was not tendered. The necessary evidence could have been put on by affidavit sworn by someone from the Laboratory. In the result, the evidence not having established those factual matters, Mr Tulau's report was not admissible. That problem could not be cured by the exercise of any discretion under the Evidence Act to admit the report. There was no such discretion.

151That submission accorded with the views of Heydon J in Dasreef Pty Ltd v Hawchar [2011] HCA 21; (2011) 243 CLR 588 at [102] - [127]. His Honour there discussed the construction of s 79 of the Evidence Act and what his Honour referred to as the common law 'proof of assumption rule' (see at [61]). His Honour took the view that there was such a rule at common law which had not been abolished by s 79. He concluded:

""[127] Conclusion. A construction of s 79 which holds that there is no proof of assumption rule in relation to s 79 tenders is difficult to reconcile with the practical exigencies pursuant to which parties conduct their cases. It is necessary for trials to be conducted in a businesslike and efficient way. That is a matter of context pointing to the view that there is a proof of assumption rule with which those tendering expert opinion evidence must comply by reason of ss 55, 56 and 79 read against the background of the common law.""

152In oral submissions the prosecutor accepted that the evidence had not proven the assumed facts as to the soil analysis. It was argued that Mr Tulau's report was nevertheless admissible, because there was no issue as to his field of expertise and his oral evidence was that the Laboratory results had confirmed his field observations as to soil type. Even if the part of his report which rested on the Laboratory results were not admissible, the balance of his report, including the conclusions which he had reached were admissible, based on his field observations alone. The Laboratory results were not a fundamental premise of the conclusions which he reached.

153It seems to me that this submission cannot be accepted, reading the report fairly and having regard to Mr Tulau's oral evidence, where in cross-examination he agreed that the Laboratory analysis was crucial to his conclusions.

154The question of the admissibility of the report thus turns on whether in order to be admitted, the assumed facts as to the soil analysis on which Mr Tulau's conclusions rested, had to be established. On Heydon J's approach in Dasreef, the report was not admissible because those facts were not proved.

155In Dasreef, the plurality did not concur with the view which Heydon J came to about the ""proof of assumption rule"", which they referred to at [41] as the ""the basis rule"". They described this to be a rule by which expert opinion evidence is to be excluded, unless the factual bases upon which the opinion is proffered are established by other evidence. 

156At [30] the plurality observed that the opinion rule in s 76 of the Evidence Act, that 'evidence of an opinion is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact about the existence of which the opinion was expressed': 

""... is expressed, as it is in order to direct attention to why the party tendering the evidence says it is relevant. More particularly, it directs attention to the finding which the tendering party will ask the tribunal of fact to make. In considering the operation of s 79(1) it is thus necessary to identify why the evidence is relevant: why it is ""evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding""[Evidence Act, s 55(1)]. That requires identification of the fact in issue that the party tendering the evidence asserts the opinion proves or assists in proving.


157At [32] the plurality said:

""To be admissible under s 79(1) the evidence that is tendered must satisfy two criteria. The first is that the witness who gives the evidence ""has specialised knowledge based on the person's training, study or experience""; the second is that the opinion expressed in evidence by the witness ""is wholly or substantially based on that knowledge"".


158In this case, there is no question that Mr Tulau had relevant specialised knowledge and training, which he applied to the results of the soil analysis in reaching his opinion as to the extent of the transitional soil at the site, or that the opinion he expressed was based on his knowledge.

159After reference to the evidence given by the expert in Dasreef and the use to which it was put by the trial judge and the Court of Appeal, the plurality observed at [37] that: 

""It should be unnecessary, but it is nonetheless important, to emphasise that what was said by Gleeson CJ in HG (and later by Heydon JA in the Court of Appeal in Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles [2001) 52 NSWLR 705 at 743-744 [85]) is to be read with one basic proposition at the forefront of consideration. The admissibility of opinion evidence is to be determined by application of the requirements of the Evidence Act rather than by any attempt to parse and analyse particular statements in decided cases divorced from the context in which those statements were made. Accepting that to be so, it remains useful to record that it is ordinarily the case, as Heydon JA said in Makita (2001) 52 NSWLR 705 at 744 [85], that ""the expert's evidence must explain how the field of 'specialised knowledge' in which the witness is expert by reason of 'training, study or experience', and on which the opinion is 'wholly or substantially based', applies to the facts assumed or observed so as to produce the opinion propounded"". The way in which s 79(1) is drafted necessarily makes the description of these requirements very long. But that is not to say that the requirements cannot be met in many, perhaps most, cases very quickly and easily. That a specialist medical practitioner expressing a diagnostic opinion in his or her relevant field of specialisation is applying ""specialised knowledge"" based on his or her ""training, study or experience"", being an opinion ""wholly or substantially based"" on that ""specialised knowledge"", will require little explicit articulation or amplification once the witness has described his or her qualifications and experience, and has identified the subject matter about which the opinion is proffered.""


160In the above passage, the plurality referred to what Heydon JA (as his Honour then was) had observed in Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles [2001] NSWCA 305; (2001) 52 NSWLR 705 at [85]. There his Honour was discussing the regulation of expert evidence under s 76 and s 79 of the Evidence Act, which had been considered in HG v R [1999] HCA 2; (1999) 197 CLR 414. There Gleeson CJ had observed:

""[39] The opinions of Mr McCombie were never expressed in admissible form. An expert whose opinion is sought to be tendered should differentiate between the assumed facts upon which the opinion is based, and the opinion in question.[9] Argument in this Court proceeded upon the basis that it was possible to identify from Mr McCombie's written report some facts which he either observed or accepted, and which could be distinguished from his expressions of expert opinion. Even so, the provisions of s 79 will often have the practical effect of emphasising the need for attention to requirements of form. By directing attention to whether an opinion is wholly or substantially based on specialised knowledge based on training, study or experience, the section requires that the opinion is presented in a form which makes it possible to answer that question.

161In Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles [2001] NSWCA 305; (2001) 52 NSWLR 705 what Heydon J had observed was:

""85 In short, if evidence tendered as expert opinion evidence is to be admissible, it must be agreed or demonstrated that there is a field of ""specialised knowledge""; there must be an identified aspect of that field in which the witness demonstrates that by reason of specified training, study or experience, the witness has become an expert; the opinion proffered must be ""wholly or substantially based on the witness's expert knowledge""; so far as the opinion is based on facts ""observed"" by the expert, they must be identified and admissibly proved by the expert, and so far as the opinion is based on ""assumed"" or ""accepted"" facts, they must be identified and proved in some other way; it must be established that the facts on which the opinion is based form a proper foundation for it; and the opinion of an expert requires demonstration or examination of the scientific or other intellectual basis of the conclusions reached: that is, the expert's evidence must explain how the field of ""specialised knowledge"" in which the witness is expert by reason of ""training, study or experience"", and on which the opinion is ""wholly or substantially based"", applies to the facts assumed or observed so as to produce the opinion propounded. If all these matters are not made explicit, it is not possible to be sure whether the opinion is based wholly or substantially on the expert's specialised knowledge. If the court cannot be sure of that, the evidence is strictly speaking not admissible, and, so far as it is admissible, of diminished weight. And an attempt to make the basis of the opinion explicit may reveal that it is not based on specialised expert knowledge, but, to use Gleeson CJ's characterisation of the evidence in HG v R [1999] HCA 2; (1999) 197 CLR 414, on ""a combination of speculation, inference, personal and second-hand views as to the credibility of the complainant, and a process of reasoning which went well beyond the field of expertise"" (at [41])."" 


162After concluding that there was no footing on which the primary judge could have concluded that the opinion in question in Dasreef was wholly or substantially based on specialised knowledge based on the expert's training, study or experience, at [41], the plurality observed that:

""[41] Contrary to submissions on behalf of Mr Hawchar, this analysis does not seek to introduce what has been called ""the basis rule"": a rule by which opinion evidence is to be excluded unless the factual bases upon which the opinion is proffered are established by other evidence. Whether that rule formed part of the common law of evidence need not be examined. It may be accepted that the Law Reform Commission's interim report on evidence [Australia, The Law Reform Commission, Evidence, Report No 26, (1985) Vol 1 at 417 [750]] denied the existence of such a common law rule and expressed the intention to refrain from including a basis rule in the legislation the Commission proposed and which was later enacted as the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) and the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). What has been called the basis rule is a rule directed to the facts of the particular case about which an expert is asked to proffer an opinion and the facts upon which the expert relies to form the opinion expressed. The point which is now made is a point about connecting the opinion expressed by a witness with the witness's specialised knowledge based on training, study or experience.""


163At [42] the plurality explained that a failure to demonstrate that an opinion expressed by a witness is based on the witness's specialised knowledge, based on training, study or experience, is a matter that goes to the admissibility of the evidence, not to its weight. 

164It follows that the plurality did not consider that s 79 required that expert opinion evidence be excluded, unless the factual bases upon which the opinion proffered were all established. It considered it to be unnecessary to resolve the question of whether the ""basis rule"" formed a part of the common law, observing, however, that the Law Reform Commission did not consider that it did. That approach reflected, presumably, that the expert evidence there in contention did not satisfy the two criteria which the plurality found had to be satisfied under s 79. Heydon J came to a similar conclusion on the facts (see Dasreef at [137]). 

165From his judgment, it is apparent that Heydon J considered that what the Law Reform Commission had said in its report as to the basis rule at common law was wrong. What was there said was:

""750. The Basis Rule. It has been implied in some cases and asserted in some academic writing that there is a rule of evidence that for expert opinion testimony to be admissible it must have as its basis admitted evidence [See Appendix C, para 107-8]. The better view is that there is no such rule. Were it to exist, it would not be possible to have opinion evidence which had as a significant component the opinions or the statements of others. This would preclude the tendering of evidence whose value is dependent upon material not before the court and, therefore, difficult for it to assess. While this would have its advantages, it would fail in its inflexibility to take account of the normal means by which experts generally form their opinions-by means of reports of technicians and assistants, consultation with colleagues and reliance upon a host of extrinsic material and information that it would be an endless and unfruitful task with which to burden the courts. It is proposed to refrain from including a basis rule in the legislation, thus allowing opinion evidence whose basis is not proved by admitted evidence prima facie to be brought before the court. Under these circumstances the weight to be accorded to it will be left to be determined by the tribunal of fact. Areas of doubt however must be addressed. These include:

· whether evidence by the expert of the hearsay foundation of his opinion may be excluded and, if so, on what grounds; and

· whether an opinion based upon hearsay material should be open to exclusion and, if it is excluded, the grounds for its exclusion.

Such material will be able to be excluded by the operation of a relevance discretion. Thus, if it appears to the court that excessive time will be expended upon the reception of the evidence, or that its prejudicial effect substantially outweighs its probative value, the court not being able to assess the weight to be accorded to it, the testimony can be excluded. The same approach is proposed to control the admissibility of the expert's testimony of the facts on which his opinion is based where a party does not propose to, or does not, call direct evidence of the truth of the statements of fact relied upon by the expert. Tactical considerations will demand that under most circumstances the bases of expert opinion testimony are established by other admissible evidence.

751. The relevance discretions will come into play on the rare occasions when other evidence is not led as to bases of the opinion. It is not envisaged that this will make a substantial change to the law as it functions at present [ibid]. The changes that it will make, however, will clarify the grounds upon which the court may exclude the evidence of the expert as to his opinion and its basis.


166Dasreef was, of course, not concerned with a criminal trial. The Law Reform Commission's footnote at [750] refers to Appendix C to the report, where as to criminal trials it was said:

· Criminal Trials. There is authority suggesting that the issue becomes one of weight in the criminal trial [Gordon v R (1982) 41 ALR 64; R v Reiner (1974) 8 SASR 02; R v Schafferius [1977] Qd R 213; R v Ahmed Din (1962) 46 Cr App R 269, 274-6; R v MacKenney (1980) 72 Cr App R 78, 81]. Notably it is the case of R v Turner [(1974) 60 Cr App R 80, 81 (Lawton LJ) (1974) 60 Cr App R 80, 81 (Lawton LJ)] that Pattenden [Pattenden, 88] cites as her authority for the putative basis rule. However, it is submitted that the words of Lord Justice Lawton do not necessarily support the existence of the rule:

It is not for this Court to instruct psychiatrists how to draft their reports but those who call psychiatrists as witnesses should remember that the facts upon which they base their opinions must be proved by admissible evidence. This elementary principle is frequently overlooked [R v Turner (1974) 60 Cr App R 80, 82].

The sanction to be imposed by the courts for nonfulfilment of this imperative was not spelt out by His Lordship. Whether what was being assumed was an admissibility criterion or simply an injunction whose breach would substantially affect the weight to be given to the opinion evidence is not clear. Lord Justice Lawton went on to say:

The psychiatrist's report contained a lot of hearsay which was inadmissible. A ruling on this ground, however, would merely have trimmed the psychiatrist's evidence: it would not have excluded it altogether [id, 83].

Once more, it is not clear whether these comments refer to the opinions or to the statements of the facts upon which they were based. Similarly, in R v MacKenny [(1980) 72 Cr App R 78, 81 (May J)] it was held that since much of a psychologist's report was based on hearsay 'that' would have to be 'edited out'. However, the English Court of Criminal Appeal has since stated definitively:

Where an expert relies on the existence or non-existence of some fact which is basic to the question on which he is asked to express his opinion, that fact must be proved by admissible evidence: see English Exporters (London) Ltd v Eldonwall Ltd [1973] Ch 415, 421E per Megarry J and R v Turner (Terence) [1957] QB 834, 840B. Thus, it would no doubt have been inadmissible if Mr Cooke had said in the present case that he had been told by somebody else that the refractive index of the fragments of glass and of the control sample was identical, and any opinion expressed by him on this basis would then have been based on hearsay. If he had not himself determined the refractive index, it would have been necessary to call the person who had done so before Mr Cooke could have expressed any opinion based on this determination [R v Abadom [1983] 1 WLR 126, 131].

Compounding the uncertainty in the criminal context, a recent Full Court decision of the Victorian Supreme Court has expressed itself in similar terms, the Chief Justice, for instance, saying:
Before the evidence sought to be adduced could have been received it would have been necessary to prove by admissible evidence the facts upon which such an expert may base his opinion before the opinion can be received [R v Haidley and Alford [1984] VR 229, 234. See also the interpretation of Kaye J in Ramsay v Watson (1961) 108 CLR 642, 648-9]. 

If it can be correctly said that an admissibility rule does not yet exist in Australia, the reasons for refusing to admit expert opinion evidence based upon material not admitted into evidence could be as follows:

― Irrelevance. The trial judge could hold an opinion to be irrelevant in the sense of it being not sufficiently relevant either because its probative value could not be assessed or was too slight [MI Aronson, NS Reaburn & MS Weinberg, Litigation: Evidence and Procedure, 2nd edn, Butterworths, Sydney, 1979, para 31.18; see above, para 57 (App C)]. 

― Criminal Trial Discretion. The common law discretion to exclude prosecution evidence when its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect could be what is utilised [This was not, of course, available in the civil case of Ramsay v Watson (1961) 108 CLR 642].

Research, has not however, revealed any authorities where these options are canvassed.


167Dasreef was discussed by Sackville AJA in Nicholls v Michael Wilson & Partners Ltd [2012] NSWCA 383, where his Honour said:

""242 Different views have been expressed as to the consequences of the failure of a party tendering an expert's report to prove the assumptions on which the report rests. In Dasreef Pty Ltd v Hawchar, Heydon J expressed the view (at [102]) that an opinion tendered under s 79 of the Evidence Act is inadmissible unless there is evidence admitted or to be admitted before the end of the tendering party's case, capable of proving matters sufficiently similar to the assumptions to render the opinion of value. By contrast, the Court of Appeal held in a case decided four months before Dasreef Pty Ltd v Hawchar (but not referred to by Heydon J), that it is enough for an expert to identify facts and a reasoning process which he or she asserts justifies the opinion, since this allows the court to evaluate the opinions expressed: Hancock v East Coast Timber Products Pty Ltd [2011] NSWCA 11; 80 NSWLR 43, at [77], per Beazley JA (with whom Giles and Tobias JJA agreed), following Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Rich [2005] NSWCA 152; 218 ALR 764, at [105], per Spigelman CJ. 

243 It is not necessary to resolve in the present case the apparent conflict between the two approaches. It is enough for present purposes to note that even if an opinion based on assumed but unproven facts is admissible, the opinion may be given little or no weight if the assumption is not made good by the evidence: Ramsay v Watson [1961] HCA 65; 108 CLR 642, at 649, per curiam. 


168Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Rich [2005] NSWCA 152; (2005) 218 ALR 764 was also a case where there was no issue as to the expertise of the expert, an accountant, who had given the opinions in contention. He had been found to be 'fully qualified to give evidence on the issues the subject of the Report' (see at [52]) and to have 'set out the statements, or assumptions, of fact on which the opinions purported to be based', as well as the process of reasoning by which he said he had reached the various opinions he had expressed (see at [53]).

169Spigelman CJ there considered Heydon J's decision in Makita and concluded at [105] that such an expert's duty will be satisfied 'if the expert identifies the facts and reasoning process which he or she asserts justify the opinion. That is sufficient to enable the tribunal of fact to evaluate the opinions expressed'. In the result his Honour concluded that the opinions should have been admitted. 

170Dasreef has been referred to in numerous later cases, including Gilham v R [2012] NSWCCA 131, where it was observed by McClellan CJ at CL:

""186 An expert in formulating an opinion is entitled to draw upon a variety of sources, which may vary in their importance and the weight the expert gives them. For example, an expert was entitled at common law to give evidence of hearsay matters which went to demonstrate their expertise: Dasreef Pty Ltd v Hawchar [2011] HCA 21; (2011) 243 CLR 588 at [69] (Heydon J). However, there is no doubt that where, in order to give an opinion in a particular case, an expert relies upon assumptions of fact as the basis of the opinion, it is necessary to prove, in admissible form, those facts or facts which are sufficiently similar, in order to render the opinion of value: Hawchar at [66] (Heydon J); Ramsay v Watson [1961] HCA 65; (1961)108 CLR 642 at 648-649; Paric v John Holland (Constructions) Pty Ltd [1985] HCA 58; (1985) 59 ALJR 844 at 846; R v Perry (1990) 49 A Crim R 243 at 249; R v Hilder (1997) 97 A Crim R 70 at 79.""


171In Gilham it was concluded that the opinions were not admissible because they were based on experiments which the expert had conducted, the primary evidence of which was captured by videos. That was to be proved by the tender of the videos. The videos were found to be inadmissible, with the result that the opinions expressed in relation to the videos were also inadmissible.

172In Paric v John Holland Constructions Pty Ltd [1985] HCA 58; (1985) 59 ALJR 844; 62 ALR 85 it was observed by the Court:

""9. It is trite law that for an expert medical opinion to be of any value the facts upon which it is based must be proved by admissible evidence (Ramsay v. Watson [1961] HCA 65; (1961) 108 CLR 642). But that does not mean that the facts so proved must correspond with complete precision to the proposition on which the opinion is based. The passages from Wigmore on Evidence cited by Samuels J.A. in the Court of Appeal (Wigmore on Evidence, (1940) 3rd ed., vol.II, 680, p.800; 2 Wigmore, Evidence 680 (Chadbourn rev. 1979), p.942) to the effect that it is a question of fact whether the case supposed is sufficiently like the one under consideration to render the opinion of the expert of any value are in accordance with both principle and common sense."" 


173In Ramsay v Watson [1961] HCA 65; (1961) 108 CLR 642 the issue was whether an objection to a question about a person's medical history had been wrongly upheld. It was there observed by the Court:

""5 .... It was argued before us that his Honour was wrong in upholding an objection to this question. It was said that the answer would have been admissible as being a statement made by a person out of court concerning his bodily sensations. The most satisfactory brief statement of the doctrine relied upon is a passage in Wills on Evidence 3rd ed. (1938), p. 209 as follows: ""Whenever there is an issue as to some person's state of health at a particular time, the statements of such person at that time or soon afterwards with regard to his bodily feelings and symptoms are admissible in evidence. This medium of proof does not appear, like most of those which are known as Declarations, to possess any special sanction of credibility; like declarations accompanying acts it would seem to have been admitted on the ground of necessity and convenience"". (at p647) 

6. The origin of this rule and its present scope and logical basis have been much discussed. It is easier to suppose it originated in practical necessity than to give it a logical place in a symmetrical scheme of conceptions concerning evidence. It is not confined to complaints of sensations of ill-health; for statements by a deceased man, said to have been poisoned, as to his state of health made before the poison was supposed to have been administered, have been received for the prosecution: R. v. Johnson [1847] EngR 368; (1847) 2 Car & K 354 (175 ER 146) . In some textbooks this rule has been put on the ground that the statements admitted were themselves relevant facts, because they were spontaneous and natural expressions of suffering forming part of a res gesta: Phillips, 10th ed. (1852) pp. 149, 150; Starkie, 4th ed. (1853) pp. 88, 468; Phipson, 8th ed. (1942) pp. 71, 72. And this view had some support from Professor Thayer in his article on Bedingfield's Case reprinted in his Legal Essays (1927). But it seems better to regard such statements as evidence of the facts they recount, and thus as exceptions to the general rule excluding hearsay: see the remarks of Dixon J. in Adelaide Chemical and Fertiliser Co. Ltd. v. Carlyle [1940] HCA 44; (1940) 64 CLR 514 at p 530 ; and see too an article by Professor Stone in (1939) 55 Law Quarterly Review 66, at 84, 85 The rationale of the rule allowing such evidence has been said to be that it was the best or only evidence available. If a man's bodily feelings at a particular time were relevant, but he could not be called as a witness, or was not a competent witness, what he had said at that time might be the only means of proving the fact. In most, if not all, of the cases in which this question has arisen the declarant was dead before the trial: see Aveson v. Kinnaird [1805] EngR 57; (1805) 6 East 188 (102 ER 1258) ; R. v. Johnson (1847) 2 Car & K 354 (175 ER 146) ; R. v. Gloster (1888) 16 Cox CC 471 ; R. v. Black (1922) 16 CAR 118 ; Gilbey v. Great Western Railway Co. (1910) 102 LT 202 ; Amys v. Barton (1912) 1 KB 40 ; Sharp v. Loddington Ironstone Co. (1924) 132 LT 229 ; Evans v. Hartigan (1941) 41 SR (NSW) 179 ; and Nalder v. Dutch-Australia Contracting Co. Pty. Ltd. [1960] VicRp 70; (1960) VR 458 . The remark of Holt C.J. in Thompson v. Trevanion [1728] EngR 9; (1693) Skinner 402 (90 ER 179) an action by a husband and wife for assault, battery and wounding of the wife is sometimes regarded as the beginning of this rule, but only because Lord Ellenborough referred to it in Aveson v. Kinnaird [1805] EngR 57; [1805] EngR 57; (1805) 6 East 188, at p 196 [1805] EngR 57; (102 ER 1258, at p 1262) . The wife, being a party, was not a competent witness. Mr. Cross has said in his work on Evidence (1958) p. 387 of this topic: ""Whatever may be its true nature, the evidence is received because it is frequently all that can possibly be available"". The rule, whatever its basis, could not be relied upon to justify the questions asked in this case. (at p648) 

7. A sounder argument for admitting evidence of what the men had told the examining doctor might have been that it was part of the material on which he formed the opinion that he gave in evidence. When a physician's diagnosis or opinion concerning his patient's health or illness is receivable, he is ordinarily allowed to state the ""history"" he got from the patient. This practice accords with what seems to be the better opinion in the United States: see Wigmore on Evidence s. 688. It matters not whether the person whose health is in question was a regular patient of the doctor, or whether the doctor saw him for the purpose of qualifying as a witness. This, of course, is quite a different matter from the rule last discussed. That, in cases where it applies, makes statements made to anyone concerning present symptoms and sensations admissible as evidence that those symptoms and sensations, in fact, existed. This makes all statements made to an expert witness admissible if they are the foundation, or part of the foundation, of the expert opinion to which he testifies; but, except they be admissible under the first rule, such statements are not evidence of the existence in fact of past sensations, experiences and symptoms of the patient. Hearsay evidence does not become admissible to prove facts because the person who proposes to give it is a physician. And, if the man whom the physician examined refuses to confirm in the witness box what he said in the consulting room, then the physician's opinion may have little or no value, for part of the basis of it has gone. Each case depends on its own facts. In this case counsel for the defendant sought to get the examining doctor to recount things he had been told by those he examined. Yet he did not undertake to call them as witnesses. Indeed he made it clear that he did not intend to do so. His Honour in his summing-up told the jury that the medical evidence was that none of the twenty-one men had, when examined, exhibited any symptoms of lead poisoning. The appellant nevertheless complains, because it seems that the respondent's counsel had suggested to the jury that they might discount this evidence, as they did not know the past medical history of the men. This comment, the appellant suggests, could not have been made had the doctor been allowed to tell the jury what they had told him. His Honour, however, could properly refuse to admit evidence of this, it having been made apparent that the men would not be called. His refusal is not a reason for a new trial. (at p649)


174Further, in Palmer-Bruyn and Parker Pty Ltd v Parsons [2001] HCA 69; (2001) 208 CLR 388, referred to by Heydon J in Dasreef at [66], Kirby J, with whom Callinan J agreed on this point (see at [214]), observed:

""137 The appellant complained that the Court of Appeal ought not to have interfered with the primary judge's conclusion that it had proved actual loss (in the form of loss of its contractual retainer by McDonald's) and that it had quantified that loss (through the evidence of the accountant, Mr Coughlan) [cf Fink v Fink (1946) 74 CLR 127 at 143; McRae v Commonwealth Disposals Commission (1951) 84 CLR 377 at 412; JLW (Vic) Pty Ltd v Tsiloglou [1994] 1 VR 237 at 245-246.]. It submitted, in effect, that the Court of Appeal had been too pernickety in concluding that it had not established its damages. It urged this Court, if necessary, to follow the approach favoured, in dissent, by Barwick CJ in Ted Brown Quarries Pty Ltd v General Quarries (Gilston) Pty Ltd[(1977) 16 ALR 23 at 27.]. 

138 I will not delay long over this point. It has to be said again that, generally, tender of an expert's opinion is only rendered relevant to the issues for trial if the factual premises upon which the opinion is based are made good by other evidence[Ramsay v Watson (1961) 108 CLR 642 at 648-649; cf Milirrpum v Nabalco Pty Ltd (1971) 17 FLR 141 at 161-163; Australian Law Reform Commission, Evidence, Interim Report No 26, (1985), vol 2 at 179-181 [107]-[108].]. It is true that the accountant's report was received into evidence without objection. However, both in the report and in cross-examination, Mr Coughlan made it clear that he based his estimate of the loss sustained by the appellant upon assumptions that McDonald's would have continued its retainer of the appellant at the same rate of net profit for two and a quarter years longer than in the event occurred. 

139 The issue on this point is therefore whether the Court of Appeal erred in concluding that the appellant did not sufficiently prove the factual premises. The respondent said that the appellant did not and that its failure was more surprising because it could have attempted to do so through the witnesses that it called. The Court of Appeal accepted this submission [[2000] Aust Torts Reports ¶81-562 at 63,785 [51].]. The primary judge, whilst complaining about the lack of specificity of the evidence and the requirement which this imposed on him to make various assumptions, concluded that there was adequate evidence to support the appellant's claim that its actual loss was $38,000. Who was correct?""


175His Honour concluded at [142] that:
""... However, as the report of the accountant was admitted by consent, undue doubts or excessive rigour about the quantification of the damage were not called for. The judge was entitled to approach the issue as a jury would - applying common sense and reason to all of the evidence. The appellant had to quantify its loss according to the civil burden of proof. Given the evidence and inferences available to the primary judge, I am inclined to think that the Court of Appeal's approach on this issue took an unduly restrictive and narrow view of the evidence and the inferences available upon it. ...""


176In the result, the current position appears to be that for expert opinion evidence to be admissible under s 79 of the Evidence Act, it must satisfy the two criteria identified by the plurality in Dasreef. That is, it must establish that the expert ""has specialised knowledge based on the person's training, study or experience"" and that the opinion expressed by the expert ""is wholly or substantially based on that knowledge"". The evidence must also be presented in a form which reveals the facts and reasoning on which the opinion rests.

177An expert opinion which meets those requirements need not be excluded if all of the factual bases upon which the opinion is proffered are not established by the expert's own evidence. Even if facts which the expert ""assumes"" or ""accepts"" in reaching the opinion expressed are not proved in some other way, then the opinion may still be admissible. That will depend on the nature of those facts and what bearing they have on the opinion. If they provide but a small part of the basis upon which the opinion rests, then the failure to prove those facts may have but little impact, and not render the opinion inadmissible. The failure to prove facts which provide a significant basis for the opinion might, by way of contrast, be such as to render the opinion no longer relevant to a fact in issue, no foundation for the opinion having been established. Such an opinion, even if it were admitted, would be of no value. Where an opinion is admitted, the failure to establish a fact which is not of such significance, may nevertheless have an impact on the weight given to the opinion. 

178In this case, the circumstances were akin to those considered in R v Abadom [1983] 1 All ER 364; 1 WLR 126, referred to at footnote [129] in appendix C to the Law Reform Commission's report. Here, Mr Tulau had been told by some unidentified person that the critical soils had been analysed at the Laboratory, with certain results. He had used those results, in order to form his opinions, but what the chain of custody had been, and what analysis had been undertaken of the soil samples and by whom, were not disclosed, nor was anyone called to give any evidence about those matters. 

179In those circumstances, as the Law Reform Commission postulated, Mr Tulau's report was inadmissible. The probative value of his opinions could simply not be tested or assessed, in the absence of evidence establishing crucial facts on which his conclusions about the soil rested. Further, even if the report had been admissible, in a criminal trial such as this, the discretion provided by s 135 of the Evidence Act to exclude the evidence, given its prejudicial effect in relation to the critical question of the extent of the transitional soil at the site, had to be exercised. These conclusions are unavoidable, given that the basis on which parts of the critical, prejudicial opinions which Mr Tulau had reached had not been revealed to the defendant and could not be tested.

2706761,R v Mathew Aquilina [2013] NSWSC 525,"Judgment
INTRODUCTION
1On 27 August 2012 Mathew Dean Aquilina (""the offender"") was indicted for the murder of Adrian John Trevett (""the deceased""). The offender pleaded guilty to manslaughter but not guilty to murder. The Crown did not accept the plea of manslaughter and the offender was tried on the count of murder jointly with his mother, Karen Dawson (""Dawson""). In the course of the trial, and in the circumstances which are more fully set out below, the offender raised the issue of provocation. 

2A third offender, David Comber (""Comber"") pleaded guilty to the deceased's murder shortly before the trial commenced. Two other offenders, Deborah Grant (""Grant"") and Kristine Weston (""Weston"") previously pleaded guilty to offences of hindering the discovery of evidence, and hindering the apprehension of Comber, respectively.


3On 26 September 2012 the jury found both Dawson and the offender guilty of the deceased's murder. 

4The maximum penalty for the offence of murder is one of life imprisonment pursuant to s 19A of the Crimes Act 1900 (""the Act""). A standard non-parole period of 20 years is prescribed for the offence pursuant to s 54A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Act""). The Crown has not sought the imposition of a life sentence upon the offender.

5In determining the appropriate sentence, I am not required to assess whether or not, having regard to the standard non-parole period, the offence is within the middle range of objective seriousness. Similarly, I am not required to commence by asking whether there are reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period (see Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [25]). The relevant statutory provisions, particularly ss 21A, 54B(2) and 54B(3) of the Sentencing Act require an approach to sentencing in which all of the relevant factors are identified and, having regard to all such factors, a determination reached as to the appropriate sentence (see Muldrock at [26], citing Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [51]). 

6The standard non-parole period for the offence of murder requires that content be given to its specification as the 'non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness'. It represents the non-parole period for a hypothetical offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, without regard to the range of factors, both aggravating and mitigating, that bear relevantly on sentencing in an individual case (see Muldrock at [27]; [31]).

7I received, in the sentencing proceedings of the offender, a victim impact statement from Lee Ostler, the deceased's niece. Ms Ostler chose not to read that statement to the court, however I have read it in its entirety. The statement sets out the effect and impact of the deceased's death upon his family, and particularly upon Ms Ostler's father who is the deceased's brother. 

8I express my sympathy to the members of the deceased's family. It is to be hoped that the opportunity which Ms Ostler has been given to provide her statement will assist her family's process of grieving. The authorities make clear the approach which is to be taken by a sentencing judge in relation to statements of that kind in a case such as the present (see R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76).


THE SENTENCE PROCEEDINGS
9As previously noted, the jury returned a verdict on 26 September 2012, more than 7 months ago. It is necessary for me to set out the circumstances which have given rise to the significant delay which has been occasioned in finalising the matter. 

10Following the verdict, and bearing in mind that there were a total of five persons charged with offences arising out of the deceased's murder, I listed the matters involving the present offender, Dawson, Comber and Weston on 30 November 2012, for the purposes of hearing submissions on sentence. The matter involving Grant had been listed, for the same purpose, on the previous day. I took these steps intending to hand down sentence in respect of all five offenders prior to the conclusion of the 2012 law term.


11On 30 November 2012, the jury's verdict having been returned more than two months previously, counsel for the offender sought an adjournment of the sentence proceedings for the purposes of obtaining medical evidence. On that occasion, I was informed by counsel that: 

(a) the offender was under ""psychiatric care"" within the prison system, a fact of which counsel was not previously aware;
(b) the offender had recently been assaulted in custody; and
(c) a report of a psychologist, Kate Siedler, had only recently been received which indicated some ""serious concerns"" (although the precise nature of those concerns was not further articulated). 

12Counsel for the offender informed me that in these circumstances an adjournment was sought in order to obtain a psychiatric assessment. Counsel further informed me that to this end, it was proposed to issue a subpoena for the production of material (I inferred, from Justice Health) and then provide that material to the psychiatrist who was to be engaged to provide a report. 

13In the circumstances, and in fairness to the offender, the Crown did not object to the matter being adjourned. Given the time of year, along with the fact that as things stood at that time no psychiatrist had been engaged, and also having regard to my own commitments at the commencement of this year, I was forced to adjourn the matter until 1 March 2013 to hear submissions on sentence.

14When the matter came before me on 1 March 2013: 

(a) no report of Ms Siedler, to which reference had previously been made and which was said to have indicated ""serious concerns"", was tendered on behalf of the offender;
(b) to the best of my knowledge, and contrary to what I was informed was proposed, no subpoena had ever been issued for the production of any material to assist in the preparation of a report by a psychiatrist;
(c) no material setting out the nature and extent of any medical treatment which I was informed had been undergone by the offender whilst in custody, was tendered; and
(d) the report of Dr Kasinathan, Psychiatrist, which was tendered in the offender's case, contained no reference to the provision of material from Justice Health, be it material produced under Subpoena or otherwise. The only reference in the entire report to the offender receiving treatment whilst in custody related to the prescription of medication.


15Bearing in mind those matters which were advanced by counsel on 30 November 2012 in support of the application for an adjournment, the circumstances in [14] above are best described as curious.

16When the matter proceeded on 1 March 2013, and in the course of submissions, counsel for the offender made reference to evidence of conversations recorded by listening device which were tendered in the trial and which, it was submitted, supported a conclusion that the offender had been provoked into killing the deceased. When I asked to be taken to those conversations which it was said specifically supported that submission, counsel indicated that she was not in a position to do so. The submissions were completed on that day, and the matter was adjourned for sentence until 5 April 2013. I gave counsel for the offender the opportunity to provide me with the references to the evidence to which she referred in her submissions. Subject to the provision of that material, the sentence proceedings were completed.

17On 8 March 2013 my associate received an e-mail from counsel for the offender, attached to which were a number of transcripts of recorded conversations. In that same correspondence, counsel for the offender sought to make further submissions and indicated an intention to rely upon a transcript of an interview between the police and Dawson. There followed various communications between counsel for the offender and the Crown, copies of which have been provided to me. 

18A number of observations should be made in relation to these various communications. 


19Firstly, when counsel for the offender made reference, in her submissions on 1 March 2013, to the significance of recorded conversations, I understood her to be referring to the evidence of those conversations which had been tendered in the trial. Some of the transcripts provided under cover of the e-mail of 8 March were additional to those tendered before the jury. I accept that when sentencing an offender following a trial, the court is not necessarily restricted to evidence tendered in the trial, and that it is open to a party to tender further material. However, if further material was to be relied upon in the offender's case, it should have been tendered when the matter was before the court. 

20Secondly, the submission as advanced to me orally in the proceedings on 1 March 2013 (at T 14 line 30 to T 15 line 6), was limited to the proposition that the transcripts of the recorded conversations were relevant to the question of whether or not words attributed to the deceased, and which were said to constitute provocation, were in fact said. The transcripts provided under cover of the e-mail of 8 March were unaccompanied by any specific submission(s) as to what findings were said to be open on the basis of their contents. Moreover, they bore various handwritten notations such as ""relevant to psychiatric opinion"" and ""comparative culpability"". Leaving aside the form in which this material was provided, it was never suggested when the submission was originally made that the transcripts went to any issue other than that of provocation. 

21Thirdly, and as I have set out in more detail below, a report from Dr Kasinathan, Psychiatrist, was tendered in the offender's case on sentence. To the extent that some of the transcripts with which I was provided were endorsed with the handwritten notation ""relevant to psychiatric opinion"" it should be observed that no such transcripts were ever provided to Dr Kasinathan for his evaluation. 

22Fourthly, and in circumstances where the evidence and submissions on sentence had been completed on 1 March (subject only to the provision of transcript references which were said to go to a discreet issue) the e-mail of 8 March was used as an opportunity to indicate that the offender now sought to rely upon excerpts from an interview between Dawson and the police. That material had not previously been tendered, and no submissions had been made in relation to it. Indeed, there had been no reference to it at all.

23Fifthly, in the correspondence which followed between the parties (copies of which were provided to me) counsel for the offender sought to qualify an earlier submission regarding the offender's criminality. 

24A combination of these circumstances left me with no option other than to re-list the sentence proceedings on 27 March 2013.

25When the matter came before me on that day, counsel for the offender confirmed that she now wished to rely upon the additional material to which I have previously referred. No satisfactory explanation was provided as to why it was that the material was not tendered when the matter was before me on 1 March. The Crown did not object to the tender of the additional transcripts of the recorded conversations to which the offender was a party. Although the Crown's position was less clear in relation to the transcript of Dawson's interview, I did not understand the Crown to ultimately object to it, bearing in mind that no order had been made, pursuant to s. 4 of the Evidence Act 1995 that the provisions of that Act would apply to the proceedings. However, the Crown submitted that the assertions made by Dawson in that interview were untested and that in these circumstances, little weight should be attached to them. The Crown also drew my attention to the fact that there was evidence in the trial that Dawson had provided inconsistent accounts of the relevant events to police, including one account which was completely exculpatory of the offender. This, the Crown submitted, provided a further reason why little weight should be afforded to anything said by her in her interviews with police.

26As a result of these matters, I was required to set a further timetable for the provision of submissions. This, in turn, necessitated the vacation of the proposed sentence date of 5 April 2013.

27When this matter came before me on 1 March 2013, a period of more than 5 months had elapsed since the jury's verdict was returned. Evidence and submissions should have been completed on that day. What followed after that time caused the sentence date to be vacated, such that it is now approximately 8 months since the jury's verdict, and almost 5 months since all of the co-offenders were sentenced.

28For a variety of reasons which will be obvious, it is preferable in cases of multiple accused that, wherever possible, all persons are sentenced together. It is also in the interests of any offender, for equally obvious reasons, that he be sentenced as soon as possible following a jury's verdict. Because of the circumstances I have outlined, it has not been possible to achieve either of those outcomes in the present case. 
29As events transpired, the transcripts of the conversations relied upon by the offender are as follows: 

(a)Disc 10, tracks 37 - 44;
(b)Disc 14, tracks 2 and 18;
(c)Disc 21, tracks 57, and 58 - 69;
(d)Disc 24, tracks 46 - 50; 55 and 61;
(e)Disc 30, tracks 37, 38 and 46;
(f)Disc 32, tracks 54 - 63; 
(g)Disc 49, tracks 57 and 58; and
(h)Disc 50, tracks 16 and 17.


30The excerpts from the interview between Dawson and the police on 11 January 2011 relied upon are as follows: 

(a) page 8, lines 1 to 5;
(b) page 10, lines 1 to 18;
(c) page 14, lines 12 to 17;
(d) page 16, lines 8 to 18.

31I have made further reference to parts of this evidence below.

THE OBJECTIVE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENDING
32For the purposes of determining the appropriate sentence, I am required to make findings of fact in relation to the circumstances of the offending. Any factual findings I make must be consistent with the verdict returned by the jury. In particular, I must accept such facts as are established by that verdict, and I must not determine any factual issue in a way which is inconsistent with it (see R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374). 

33The Crown bears the onus of satisfying me, beyond reasonable doubt, of any finding of fact against the offender. The offender bears the onus of proving factual matters in mitigation on the balance of probabilities. Further, the practical effect of the requirement that findings of fact against an offender be established beyond reasonable doubt is that I am obliged to sentence, consistent with the jury's verdict, upon a view of the facts which is most favourable to the offender (see Cheung v R [2001] HCA 67; (2001) 209 CLR 201. 

34The Crown case against the offender was that he was part of an extended joint criminal enterprise with Dawson and Comber, amounting to an agreement, that the deceased would be assaulted by the application of physical force. The Crown further alleged, and it was not disputed at trial, that it was the offender who was primarily responsible for committing the act of strangulation which caused the death of the deceased. Leaving aside specific issues which have arisen on sentence, with which I have dealt separately below, I find that the circumstances of the offending were as follows. 

35At the time of his death the deceased was aged 62. He resided alone in a caravan which was located on a vacant block of land at Red Range, a small village situated east of the township of Glen Innes in northern New South Wales. The deceased was well known in the local area. An avid cycling enthusiast who used his bicycle as his principal mode of transportation, he operated a small business selling fruit and vegetables from a cart in Glen Innes as a means of supplementing his income. 

36At the time of the deceased's death Dawson resided, with her 12 year old son Brandon, on a property adjacent to that of the deceased. As a consequence, she and the deceased became friends. They would socialise together, and were in the habit of drinking heavily in each other's presence. 

37At some time in or about the middle of 2010, the relationship between the Dawson and the deceased became strained. In particular, Dawson made allegations to other persons that the deceased had sexually harassed her. Importantly, Dawson had also complained to a friend that whilst minding her grandchildren, she had seen the deceased inappropriately touch one of them. The child said to have been touched inappropriately was the offender's son. 

38On 28 October 2010 Dawson drove the deceased to the Jackadgery Caravan Park which was located on the Gwydir Highway, 120 kilometres east of Glen Innes. It was the intention of the deceased to stay the night at that location, before undertaking a cycling trip across the Gibraltar Range on the following day. Dawson left the deceased at the caravan park and arranged to collect him on the following day from a location known as Ranger's Hut, which was on the eastern side of the Gibraltar Range, further towards Glen Innes. When taken to the caravan park by the offender, the deceased had in his possession an ""Apollo"" road bike, along with a black backpack and a bicycle helmet. He was in possession of approximately $1,000.00 when he checked into the caravan park.

39On the morning of 29 October 2010 Dawson drove to Casino to see the offender. I am satisfied that the purpose of doing so was to discuss, with the offender, the behaviour of the deceased which Dawson had reported to other persons in the period leading up to that time. I am also satisfied that at the instigation of Dawson, the offender agreed to travel with her to Red Range for the purpose of confronting the deceased about his alleged behaviour. The offender asked Comber to accompany them.

40On that same day, Dawson drove the offender and Comber from Casino to Red Range, stopping at Glen Innes to purchase alcohol. When he left Casino, the offender was in possession of an iron bar and a knife. 

41Upon arrival at Red Range, Dawson left the offender and Comber in an area known as the ""Old Butter Factory"" which was adjacent to her premises. That area housed an open shed with a cement floor and some items of furniture. Dawson then collected the deceased and returned to Red Range. Dawson left the deceased near the area of the Old Butter Factory, where the offender and Comber were waiting. When the deceased entered that area, the offender struck him from behind with the iron bar which he had brought with him. The blow was sufficiently severe to draw blood. The offender then called Dawson to join himself, the deceased, and Comber. Dawson then left her premises and made her way down to the Old Butter Factory. Following her arrival, various allegations were put to the deceased about his behaviour. During this period, the deceased was subject to a number of acts of violence. This included him being punched by Dawson and the offender. 

42At a time when the deceased was lying helpless on the ground, the offender fashioned a noose from a length of rope which had been found nearby. The offender then placed the rope around the deceased's neck and killed him by pulling on it. Although there was some evidence that Dawson and Comber also pulled on the rope, the offender conceded in his evidence at the trial (particularly at T 468 lines 30 to 45) that he was the person primarily responsible for pulling on the rope. Importantly, the offender told the jury (commencing at T 468 line 24) that in doing so he wanted to kill the deceased. He also told the jury (commencing at T 549 line 40) that he pulled on the rope for 15 to 20 minutes, during which period the deceased was gurgling and gasping for breath. In a conversation recorded by way of listening device (exhibit L 44) the offender made reference to the fact that in pulling on the rope, he stood on the deceased's shoulder, a manoeuvre which was obviously designed to ensure maximum leverage. 

43Following the deceased's death, his body was loaded into the rear of the Dawson's vehicle with the aid of a wheelbarrow by the offender, Dawson and Comber. The area where the deceased was killed was cleaned, following which Dawson drove, with the offender and Comber, to Sandy Hill, a location approximately 27 kilometres east of Tenterfield. Upon arrival, the deceased's body was disposed of in the bush and barely covered. Dawson then drove the offender and Comber back to Glen Innes.

44Two days later, on 31 October 2010, Dawson, the offender and Comber returned to Sandy Hill. The purpose of doing so was to take steps to further conceal the deceased's body in the hope that it would not be discovered. Upon the arrival of Dawson, the offender and Comber, the deceased's body was dragged by the offender and Comber through a fence line and then rolled down a steep slope until such time as it hit a fallen tree. Sticks and branches were used to cover the body.

45Evidence was given at the trial by Professor Timothy Lyons, a Forensic Pathologist, who conducted an autopsy of the remains of the deceased on 4 January 2011. Whilst there was extensive decomposition and some early skeletalisation, Professor Lyons was able to observe that there was a noose around the neck of the deceased which had been constructed from what he described as heavy duty twisted hemp rope, which had been tied with a bow line. 

46Professor Lyons described the noose as being 40 centimetres in circumference, and found that it had been wrapped twice around the deceased's body. Leaving aside detected defects in the soft tissues of the clavicle, Professor Lyons also observed that there was a defect in the deceased's body consistent with his genitalia being absent. However, he was not able to come to a definitive conclusion as to whether the deceased's genitals had been removed by a person, or whether they had been removed as a consequence of animal predation or heavy maggot infestation.

47The ultimate opinion of Professor Lyons was that the noose around the deceased's neck gave rise to neck compression and asphyxia, causing his death. He said that when pressure is applied to the neck area, there are three common mechanisms which can be associated with resultant death, namely: 

(a)restriction of the airway;
(b)obstruction of the blood supply;
(c)the application of pressure to nerves of the neck.


48Professor Lyons explained that the deceased's death could have occurred due to any one of those methods, or alternatively a combination of more than one. 

Matters the subject of agreement between the parties
49The Crown submitted that there were a number of specific conclusions which I should reach which were relevant to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending. But for one particular matter (namely, whether the offender's actions in fashioning the noose, applying it to the deceased's body, and killing him, evidenced some degree of planning on his part - an issue I have dealt with more fully below) counsel for the offender expressly stated that she took no issue with the Crown's submission. I am satisfied that the offending included the following specific aspects: 

(a)the deceased's killing occurred in the context of an agreement in which it was at the very least contemplated, if not intended, that violence would be perpetrated upon him;

(b)to that end, the offender made preparations which included recruiting Comber, and taking a knife and an iron bar with him to Red Range;

(c)the offender and Comber lay in wait for the deceased;

(d)the offender ambushed the deceased, striking him with the iron bar from behind as he entered the shed;

(e)the deceased was subjected to violence by the offender, Dawson and Comber;

(f)the offender observed Comber to torment the deceased with a knife which he (the offender) had brought with him;

(g)the offender was aware that in so acting, Comber was intending to steal from the deceased;

(h)the deceased was detained over a period of several hours;

(i)before the noose had been placed around his neck, the deceased was rendered, through his consumption of alcohol and the violence perpetrated upon him, incapable of fending for himself;

(j)the act of strangling the deceased extended over a period of time, for the majority of which the offender was actively involved in pulling on the rope;

(k)the offender derived a personal gain from the crime, both in terms of cash taken from the deceased's wallet as well as the money raised from his sale of the deceased's bicycle;

(l)the offender was party to disposal of the deceased's remains;

(m)the offender was motivated by vengeance, acting as an ""executioner"" in circumstances where he himself had expressed doubt about Dawson's allegations concerning the deceased's behaviour;

(n)the offence was committed in company;

(o)at the time of the deceased's death, the offender intended to kill him.

50Whilst the matters in [49] were not the subject of any dispute, counsel for the offender took issue with the Crown's submission that the actions of the offender in fashioning the noose, placing it around the deceased's neck, and pulling on it until he was dead, demonstrated a degree of planning. Although the Crown did not suggest that the offender had gone to Red Range with the strangulation of the deceased specifically in mind, it was submitted that his actions in this regard involved a number of separate and deliberate acts which were inconsistent with the offender's assertion in evidence that he had suddenly ""lost it"". 

51Counsel for the offender submitted that the offender's actions in this regard should be viewed as being essentially spontaneous. Counsel submitted that such conclusion was consistent with the fact that the offender had brought other weapons to the scene but had not used them. Counsel also submitted that the offender's ability to fashion the noose as he did was explicable on the basis of his previous experience with ropes.

52On the offender's own evidence, he located the rope, made it into a noose, and then used it to kill the deceased. In my view, and irrespective of what previous experience the offender may have had in the use of ropes, the fashioning of a length of rope into a noose of sufficient strength to kill the deceased required dexterity, concentration, and a conscious application of thought. Those actions, and those which followed, bespeak of deliberate and controlled steps having been taken by the offender to bring about the death of the deceased with the use of a ligature. This resulted, on the offender's own evidence, in the deceased gargling and gasping for air as the offender stood on his shoulder and pulled on the rope over a period of between 15 to 20 minutes. That, on any view, was a horrifying manner in which to die. 

Aggravating factors
53The offending had a number of aggravating features. The use of a ligature has been treated as a form of weapon (as to which see Versluys v R [2008] NSWCCA 76) and accordingly that is an aggravating feature pursuant to s. 21A(2)(c) of the Sentencing Act. Further, the offence was committed in company (s. 21A(2)(e) of the Sentencing Act) and it involved a series of criminal acts (s. 21A(2)(m) of the Sentencing Act).

54The offender's participation, on two separate occasions, in the treatment of the deceased's body following his death is also an aggravating factor (see for example Knight v R [2006] NSWCCA 292; R v Yeo [2003] NSWSC 315). However, I am not satisfied that the deceased's body had been mutilated by the removal of his genitalia. Even if I were in a position to be satisfied of that fact, there is no evidence at all which would link that mutilation to any conduct on the part of the offender. In any event, the general principle that the treatment of the body of the deceased is capable of amounting to an aggravating factor has been extended to cases where such treatment did not involve any form of mutilation: R v Goundar [2010] NSWSC 1170; R v Dong [2010] NSWSC 1242. 

Conclusion as to the objective circumstances of the offending
55Both counsel made submissions as to where, within the relevant range, the objective seriousness of the offending fell. Whether I am required to quantify the distance between the offending before the court, and the conduct involved in a putative offence in the middle of the range, is open to debate. For example, it has been observed that a sentencing judge need not, and arguably should not, engage in such an exercise (see PK v R [2012] NSWCCA 263 per McCallum J at [25] with whom Macfarlan JA and Price J agreed). However, the assessment of objective seriousness of the offending nevertheless remains an important part of the sentencing process.

56One can only imagine the anguish and the helplessness which would have been experienced by the deceased in the final moments of his life. He lay on the ground, gargling and gasping for air, whilst the offender pulled on the rope, standing on the deceased's shoulder as he did so to ensure maximum leverage was achieved. The deceased endured this for a period of between 15 and 20 minutes.


57The offender then played a part in disposing of the deceased's body in bushland, only to return to it some days later in an apparent effort to take further steps to conceal it. He then profited from the deceased's death by (inter alia) selling his bicycle.


58Initially, in oral submissions, counsel for the offender expressly conceded that the role played by the offender was greater than that played by each of Dawson and Comber. Later, in further written submissions, counsel qualified that position somewhat and submitted that although the physical acts committed by the offender were greater, his moral culpability was less than that of Comber. This, it was submitted, was because Comber had participated in the killing for personal gain only, as opposed to the offender, who, it was said, had become involved because it had been reported to him that the deceased had acted inappropriately towards his child and his mother. Counsel submitted that these considerations led to the conclusion that the offender's overall criminality was less than that of Comber.

59I do not accept the submission that the offender's overall criminality is less than that of Comber. In my view, it is greater. The evidence before me in these proceedings does not enable any definitive conclusion to be reached as to why it was that Comber participated in the agreement which led to the deceased's killing. What is clear, is that it was the offender who recruited Comber, it was the offender who took weapons with him, and it was the offender who assembled the murder weapon. It is also clear that it was the offender's actions which were primarily responsible for bringing about the deceased's death. For reasons to which I will come, the fact that the offender's involvement may have been sparked by what Dawson had told him about the deceased's alleged behaviour assists him only to a limited degree, and certainly does not provide an excuse for what ultimately transpired. 

60Were I required to do so, I would conclude that in all of the circumstances, the offending is above the mid range of objective seriousness.

THE OFFENDER'S SUBJECTIVE CASE
61Material concerning the offender's personal background is essentially limited to that contained in the report of Dr Kasinathan, Psychiatrist, which was tendered before me. The offender is now 27 years of age. At the time of his commission of the offence he resided in Casino with Grant and six children. The offender was the biological father to two of those children, aged 3 and 4. His daughter died in a motor vehicle accident when the offender was 21 years of age.

62Dr Kasinathan recorded that the offender has a history of depressive illness, and had attempted suicide on more than one occasion. He also reported that the offender has been treated whilst in custody for depression and is presently taking anti-depressant medication. As I have noted, those medical records were not tendered before me on sentence. 

63The offender left school in Year 10 and completed two thirds of an apprenticeship as a butcher. Beyond that, his employment history is vague. 

64Dr Kasinathan concluded that the offender did not have a mental illness but qualified for the psychiatric diagnoses of Dysthymia, Alcohol abuse, Cannabis dependence disorder and Amphetamine dependence disorder. 

65I have taken all of these matters into account. However, it was not submitted that any of the diagnoses made by Dr Kasinathan, or the depressive illness for which the offender is apparently receiving treatment whilst in custody, would render a term of imprisonment more onerous than might otherwise be the case.

66Having regard to the submissions made on behalf of the offender, the following issues of mitigation arise: 

(a)whether the offender's history of alleged sexual abuse, and his ""insecure attachment"" to Dawson as diagnosed by Dr Kasinathan, were causally related to his offending;

(b)whether the offender was provoked (s. 21A(3)(c) of the Sentencing Act);

(c)whether the offender has no, or no significant, record of previous convictions (s. 21A(3)(e) of the Sentencing Act);

(d)whether the offender is unlikely to re-offend and has good prospects of rehabilitation (s. 21A(3)(g) and (h) of the Sentencing Act); and

(e)whether the offender has shown remorse (s. 21A(3)(i) of the Sentencing Act).


The offender's history of sexual abuse
67Counsel for the offender submitted that the offender's history of sexual abuse, as well as an ""insecure attachment"" to Dawson which was diagnosed by Dr Kasinathan, were causally related to the offending. In order to consider this submission it is necessary to make reference to a number of aspects of the evidence.

68In the course of his evidence in chief, the offender said that he had served a sentence of three months imprisonment in 2007 during which he was sexually assaulted. In particular he gave the following evidence (commencing at T 452 line 52):


Q. When you say forced to do sexual things, could you be a little bit more explicit?
A There was two older inmates that made me have sex with them and stuff like that.

Q Was that anal sex with you?
A Yes
Q And were you forced to also have sex with them?
A Yes.

69As I have noted, a report of Dr John Kasinathan, Psychiatrist, was tendered on sentence. Because of the reliance placed on that report, it is necessary for me to make a number of observations in relation to it. 

70Firstly, amongst the material which was provided to Dr Kasinathan for the purposes of furnishing his report was a copy of a statement of facts, along with copies of transcripts of two interviews between Dawson and the police. The statement of facts is not before me in evidence. Of the two transcripts, only one is before me. Dr Kasinathan expressly stated that this material had been reviewed and the contents ""incorporated into (his) final opinion"". It would therefore seem clear that material which has not been tendered before me has formed part of the basis upon which Dr Kasinathan reached his opinions.


71Secondly, in terms of the offender's history of alleged sexual abuse, the history taken by Dr Kasinathan included the following (at p. 7):

""Whilst in Grafton jail, Mr Aquilina reported three Aboriginal inmates raped him, he was forced to perform oral sex and he said that he was anally raped"". 

72It is noted that this history is, at least in part, at odds with the offender's sworn evidence before the jury as set out in [68] above.

73Thirdly, Dr Kasinathan under the heading ""Personal History"" (at p. 7) stated:

""You reported that Ms Grant informed you that Mr Aquilina was totally under his mother's control and continued to try to please her despite her malicious behaviour and indifference towards him"". 

74The reference to ""Ms Grant"" is a reference to the offender's former partner who, as I previously noted, had pleaded guilty to an offence of hindering the discovery of evidence. I infer that this passage of the report is based upon something allegedly said by Grant to the offender's solicitor, which was in turn conveyed by the offender's solicitor to Dr Kasinathan in a letter of instructions. There was no evidence before me of any such assertion made by Grant. 

75Fourthly, part of the history recorded by Dr Kasinathan included the following (at p. 3):

""Mr Aquilina reported consuming significant amounts of alcohol and other drugs prior to and at the material time. He reported consuming $100 worth of cannabis and intravenous amphetamine (speed) .05 grams on the day prior. He reported drinking alcohol on the morning of the offence and at the material time reported consuming two cans of Jack Daniels and two litres of cask wine"" (my emphasis).

76There was certainly evidence before the jury to support the conclusion that the offender had consumed alcohol during the period leading up to the killing of the deceased. However, unlike the history which was recorded by Dr Kasinathan, the offender did not give any specific evidence of how much (or what kind) of alcohol he consumed. Accordingly, on the evidence which was before the jury, the extent to which the offender may have been intoxicated or disinhibited was far from clear. 

77Further, and perhaps even more significantly, at no stage in the course of his evidence before the jury did the offender ever assert that he had consumed any drug ""prior to and at the material time"" as was reported by Dr Kasinathan. The offender gave no evidence on sentence. 

78Counsel for the offender, as I understood it, sought to rely upon the contents of lines 1 to 18 on page 10 of Dawson's interview as evidence which supported a conclusion that the offender had consumed drugs at or about the time of the murder of the deceased. That portion of the interview (which follows on from questions directed to alcohol consumption on the day of the deceased's death) includes an assertion by Dawson that the offender and Comber consumed ""two bongs"", along with a further assertion that they ""might have been on pills but (she) wasn't sure"". According to Dawson, the offender ""was talking about something having something out of like out of some sachet or something"". She went on to describe the offender as having ""a lot of energy"". 

79In my view, the untested assertions of Dawson, particularly in the absence of any evidence from the offender, provide no reliable support for the conclusion that the offender had consumed, or was affected by, drugs at or about the time that the deceased was killed. In terms of any marijuana use, the basis of Dawson's assertion is not clear. She certainly did not tell the police that she made any such observation herself. In terms of any use of other drugs, it is apparent that Dawson's assertions were based upon what she was told by the offender. As I have set out below, the Court of Criminal Appeal has, for some time, been critical of reliance being placed upon untested hearsay assertions of the nature of those contained in Dawson's interview. 

80The conclusions reached by Dr Kasinathan, upon which counsel for the offender relied, included the following (at p. 9 - 10):

"" ... due to his own experience of being sexually assaulted and of having previously lost a child, this anger, combined with past unresolved grief, was likely to be overpowering and uncontained, particularly when he was disinhibited by alcohol and other drugs. His insecure attachment left him aligned to protect his mother, despite her inconsistencies, and reduced his ability to weigh up the 'evidence' of the victim ""being a paedophile"" in an objective and rational manner. The combination and synergistic interaction of the above developmental, personality and attachment factors helps us understand why Mr Aquilina felt provoked to contribute to the killing of the victim"" (my emphasis in each case).

81The issue of provocation to which Dr Kasinathan referred is dealt with below. At this juncture, it is appropriate to make a number of further observations in relation to Dr Kasinathan's report, and the conclusions he expressed.

82Firstly, Counsel for the offender explained that the provision of (inter alia) the statement of facts was because of ""financial constraints"" and that the purpose in providing the statement of facts was to furnish Dr Kasinathan with ""an overview"" and ""a little bit of background"". Counsel emphasised that Dr Kasinathan was not ""invited to make any findings as a result of that"". Be that as it may, the fact remains that material was provided to Dr Kasinathan which he took into account in forming his opinion, but which is not in evidence before me.

83Secondly, and even though the letter of instructions is not before me, it is apparent that such instructions included observations made to the offender's solicitor by the offender's former partner, Grant. In the form in which they were conveyed to Dr Kasinathan, those observations are in the nature of untested second hand hearsay. Significantly, they related to the relationship between the offender and Dawson, and formed part of the material upon which Dr Kasinathan based his ultimate opinion. 


84Thirdly, the opinion of Dr Kasinathan was clearly based, at least in part, upon the history provided by the offender. That history included assertions regarding his use of drugs at the relevant time. As I have noted the offender gave no such evidence before the jury, and gave no such evidence before me on sentence. 

85There have been repeated statements by the Court of Criminal Appeal regarding the caution with which unsubstantiated, and untested, assertions recorded in medical (and similar) reports tendered in sentence proceedings should be treated (see for example Butters v R [2010] NSWCCA 1 at [18]). Leaving aside the fact that Dr Kasinathan was provided with material which is not before the court on sentence, his report contained a considerable amount of material in the nature of unsubstantiated and untested assertions. The contents of Dawson's interview fall into the same category. 

86None of these observations should be construed, in any way, as a criticism of Dr Kasinathan. He was obviously left to express his opinions on the basis of the material provided to him. However in the circumstances that I have outlined, his report, and the opinions which are expressed in it, are in my view deserving of little or no weight. 

87Further, and in any event, I am not satisfied of the truthfulness of the offender's account of being sexually assaulted in gaol. Leaving aside the inconsistency between his evidence to the jury and his account to Dr Kasinathan, the offender admitted in the course of his evidence before the jury that when he first spoke to the police he had told various untruths in order to minimise his role in the deceased's killing (see for example his evidence at T 527 lines 10 to 15). 

88The offender also agreed that he had omitted to tell the police about matters which he asserted in evidence and which were, on any view, material. For example, and as I have referred to further below, the offender gave evidence that the deceased was ""smirking"" at him which made him (i.e. the offender) believe that the deceased had in fact interfered with his son and caused him to act as he did in killing the deceased. Notwithstanding the obvious significance of this, the offender made no mention of it at all to the police when they interviewed him. His explanation was that ""he didn't think it would matter"" (see his evidence at T 530 line to T 531 line 20).

89Having heard the offender's evidence, and having viewed him carefully as he gave it, it is my view that much of what he said was unreliable. For these reasons, I do not accept his evidence regarding the sexual assault said to have been committed on him whilst in custody. 


90For all of these reasons I do not accept the submission that there exists any causal relationship between the offender's history of alleged sexual abuse, and his offending. Further, in the circumstances, I do not accept the opinion of Dr Kasinathan regarding the offender's ""insecure attachment"" to Dawson. 

Provocation
91As previously noted, the offender raised provocation at his trial. This was obviously rejected by the jury. However, that does not preclude a finding that provocation is a mitigating actor (see R v Fahada [2013] NSWCCA 86 at [18] per Fullerton J). 

92Following the decision of the High Court in Muldrock (supra) differing views have been expressed concerning the range of factors to be taken into account in determining the objective seriousness of the offence. On one view, where provocation is established such that it is a mitigating factor under s. 21A(3)(c) of the Sentencing Act it is a fundamental quality of the offending which may reduce its objective seriousness (see R v Willmott [2012] NSWSC 824 at [9]). In any event provocation, if found, is a factor relevant to the sentence to be imposed (see Markarian (supra)). 

93At the close of the evidence in the trial, and before counsel addressed the jury, an issue arose as to the evidence which was available to be considered by the jury in relation to provocation. In the course of submissions at that time, counsel for the offender conceded that what might be described as the direct evidence of provocation (or, in other words, the evidence of statements made or acts done by the deceased towards the offender) was limited to the following passage from the offender's evidence (at T 463 lines 32-46):

Q And so what happened then?
A For a while we were just talking calmly and then he turned to me and said that he loved them little boys more than you'll ever know and that is when I lost it and I hit him myself.
Q When you say you hit him yourself, what did you actually do?
A I punched him four times in the head.
Q Why did you do that?
A Because I was angry and by him saying what he did I though he was telling me that it was true about what he'd done (my emphasis).


94Counsel for the offender had further submitted at the close of the evidence in the trial that statements made by Dawson to the offender concerning the deceased's behaviour amounted to ""hearsay provocation"" which the jury could properly consider. By reference to the decisions in R v Quartly (1986) 11 NSWLR 332 and R v Clarke [2008] NSWCCA 36, and particularly having regard to the judgment of Lee J in the former decision, I rejected counsel's submission. It followed that the evidence of provocation by the deceased which was available to be considered by the jury was limited. 

95It is evident from the jury's verdict that they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was not acting under provocation when the deceased was killed. However, it has been submitted on behalf of the offender that I should conclude, for the purposes of sentence, that there was some provocation on the part of the deceased which was directed to the offender, and which mitigates the severity of the offence. It is therefore necessary to set out, in some detail, the evidence which bears upon this issue.

The offender's evidence at trial
96The offender gave evidence at trial and was cross examined by senior counsel for Dawson and by the Crown. Having told the jury that he had gone to Dawson's premises ""in order to find out (himself) if it was true about someone touching (his) boys"" (at T 457 line 37) he gave the following evidence in chief (commencing at T 457 line 45):

Q. Did you discuss killing Adrian Trevett with anyone before you went over there?
A. Because of how angry and upset I was, I do believe that I said it to David, but I did not mean it.
Q. What did you say to David?
A. I believe I said that I wanted to kill the person.
Q. And you say you didn't mean it?
A. No. I was angry and upset.
Q. Did you have any discussion with your mother at all?
A. I believe I may have said it to her once also as well.

97Having told the jury that the deceased was struck by Dawson, the offender then said (commencing at T 463 line 31):

Q. And so what happened then?
A. For a while we were just talking calmly and then he turned to me and said that he loved them little boys more than you'll ever know and that is when I lost it and I hit him myself.
Q. When you say you hit him yourself, what did you actually do?
A. I punched him four times in the head.
Q. Why did you do that?
A. Because I was angry and by him saying what he did I thought he was telling me that it was true about what he'd done.
Q. And how was he talking at that stage?
A. Because of the alcohol he was slurring his words a little bit but he was also smiling a lot at me and laughing about the things that I was asking him.
Q. Now, you said you started punching him?
A. Yes.
Q. And what happened then?
A. At one stage he had fallen over onto - landing onto the round table, which I believe he hit his chest and also his head.
Q. What happened then?
A. He was laying on the ground, that was when I noticed that his glasses had broken and he had a few cuts on his face from the glasses.
Q. And what happened then?
A. That was when I was - the three of us were standing there just talking.
Q. When you say ""just talking"", what were you saying?
A. I was telling my mother that what sort of a bad person he was for doing what he done and I was quite angry at that stage and that was when I seen the piece of rope and tied a slip knot in it and put it around his neck.
Q. So you did that?
A. Yes.
Q. And you were the one who put around his neck?
A. Yes.

98The offender then gave the following further evidence (commencing at T 468 line 24):

Q. You said, just before the adjournment, that you took the rope?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you know where the rope had come from?
A. It was just laying there on the floor inside the shed area.
Q. You didn't bring it to the property?
A. No.
Q. Why did you take the rope?
A. Because at that stage I was quite angry and I wanted him to feel my pain.
Q. You said you're the one who put the rope around his neck?
A. Yes.
Q. And you said you pulled it at the end?
A. Yes.
Q. What were you doing at the time? What was your intention?
A. Because I lost it and snapped, I wanted to kill him.
Q. And is it correct that you said in one of the interviews that you were the main person who did it. Is that true?
A. Yes.
 
99The offender admitted that when spoken to by police he told a number of untruths about his involvement in the deceased's death. They included telling police that it was Comber who placed the noose around the deceased's neck (Exhibit N2 at Q 201; T 503 line 31). He further admitted (at T 473 line 26) that he told untruths because he was trying to minimise his role in what had occurred.

100In the course of cross-examination by senior counsel for Dawson, the offender gave the following further evidence about the circumstances of the deceased's death (commencing at T 494 line 30):

Q. In terms of the actual events leading up to Mr Trevett's death, you had lost it, as you say?
A. Yes, that's right.
Q. And you were the one who punched him to the head, is that right?
A. I did, about four times, yes.
Q. And that was when he was still sitting on a chair in that shed area?
A. Yes, he was.
Q. And he fell to the ground after you were punching him?
A. He did.
Q. And you then picked up the rope?
A. Yes, that is correct.
Q. Put it into the knot and put around his neck?
A. Yes.
Q. And you pulled on it?
A. Yes.
 
101The offender asserted, at the conclusion of cross-examination by senior counsel for Dawson, that he had pulled on the rope until the deceased was dead ""because (he) was angry"" (at T 523 line 24). Significantly, the Crown's cross-examination commenced with the following (at T 523 line 27):

Q. You were angry because of what your mother had told you, weren't you?
A. Yes.


102The Crown further cross-examined the offender (commencing at T 530 line 1) as follows:

Q. What do you mean by 'I lost it'?
A. Him saying the things he'd done and me being told the things I was told about what he done, it made me snap.
Q. He never said he'd done the things, did he?
A. Well by him saying that he loves them little boys more than I'll ever know, I took that as he was saying that he did do it.
Q. So somebody's denying that he touched three little boys or two little boys, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And that person continually denies that he touched those boys, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And eventually in the course of denying, he attempts to reinforce that by saying, ""You don't know how much I love those little boys"", correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And because of his denials, and his attempt to emphasise the reason or a support for those denials, it means he did it?
A. Well when he was laughing and smirking at me, I took it as the way I took it, which was he done it.
Q. When did you remember that he was laughing and smirking at you?
A. When I was asking the questions, he was.
Q. No, when did you first remember that after the event, that he was laughing and smirking at you?
A. Straight away.
Q. Well that must have been something very important, was it?
A. In a way it was, yeah.
Q. Must have been one of the - well he was denying everything, wasn't he?
A. Yes, he was.
Q. But he was laughing and smirking you say?
A. Yes.
Q. And that was what caused you to take the answer he gave as being an admission?
A. Yes.
Q. So that must have been very important in your mind that he was laughing and smirking?
A. It did upset me, yes.
Q. And it must have been something that stayed with you the whole time?
A. Yes.
Q. Something that would be at the forefront of your mind?
A. Yes.
Q. About these events?
A. Yes.
Q. It would be just as important in these events as the words, ""You don't know how much I love those little boys"", wouldn't it?
A. Yes.
Q. Can you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury why you've never told anyone publicly, about that. Withdraw that. Can you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury why you never told the police about the smirking and the laughing and the smiling in your record of interview?
A. Because I didn't think it would matter, that's why.
Q. This thing that convinced you that he'd touched your boys, you didn't think it would matter?
A. No, not really.
Q. This thing, that had caused you to get so upset you say, you didn't think would matter?
A. Yes.
Q. And when you got to the walk through, why didn't you tell the police about the smirking, the smiling and the laughing, when you were then denying the allegations?
A. I just didn't think of it, there was that much going through my mind.
103The Crown's cross-examination then turned to the circumstances of the killing of the deceased (commencing at T 549 line 40):

Q. Did he start to gurgle and gargle and gasp, withdraw that, that's three questions. Did he start to gasp for breath?
A. Well yes, he did.
Q. Did he start to make a gurgling sound?
A. Yes.
Q. Did he - you describe it as sounding like he had blood in his airways, I think in one of your interviews?
A. Yes.
Q. Was that when you were pulling it the first time?
A. Yes, it was.
Q. You were pulling as hard as you could?
A. I don't believe I was pulling that hard, but I was pulling on it.
Q. The combined pulling, that's your pulling?
A. Yes.
Q. Pulling by the other two and then you taking back over, all took a fair amount of time, didn't it?
A. I believe it did, yes.
Q. Took about 20 minutes or more for him to expire?
A. Yeah, about 15, 20 minutes.
Q. And during all of that time when anyone was pulling on that rope, he was gasping for air?
A. Yes.
Q. And he was making this gurgling, gargling sound?
A. Yes. 

104The Crown's cross-examination then turned to the offender's assertion regarding the words of the deceased which were said to constitute provocation (commencing at T 550 line 24):

Q. Can I just ask you this, Blake's not your son is he?
A. No he's not.
Q. He's Deborah's son by another male?
A. Yes.
Q. And do you treat him any differently to Malachi and Israel?
A. No I don't, I love him like he's my own son.
Q. If somebody accused you that you were biased in favour of your two own sons, you'd tell them how much you loved them, wouldn't you?
A. Yes.
Q. You might even say, ""You don't know how much I love that bloke"", mightn't you?
A. Yes.
Q. You're not a paedophile, are you?
A. No I am not.
Q. It's a very common expression for people to use to explain their attitude to children, isn't it?
A. Yes, but when you believe something and you are angry, you don't think about that, do you?
Q. Well the point is you see, what you just said is it didn't matter what he said and what he did, you were already in that angry mood, weren't you?
A. Yes I was.
Q. Wasn't anything he did that day that made you do this, it was what you went there to do, wasn't it?
A. I was angry before I got there. (my emphasis).


105The Crown submitted that I would not be satisfied that the words attributed by the offender to the deceased were in fact said, and that I would not be satisfied that the deceased was ""smiling and smirking"". Accordingly, the Crown submitted that I would conclude that the offender was not provoked. In advancing this submission, the Crown relied (inter alia) upon the fact that there was nothing said by the offender, when spoken to by police, about the fact that the deceased was ""smiling and smirking"" at or about the time he said the words attributed to him. The Crown further submitted that even if I concluded that the words attributed to the deceased were in fact said, a proper analysis of the evidence established that it was not these words, nor anything else said or done by the deceased, which provoked the offender. 

106Counsel for the offender, whilst obviously accepting that the jury had rejected provocation, submitted that I should conclude that ""the reason that the offender was found guilty of murder was not because the jury did not accept that he was provoked and lost control, but rather that he failed the ordinary person test"". Clearly, the jury rejected provocation. The precise basis on which they did so is difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain.

107Counsel for the offender further submitted that there was specific support for the conclusion that the words attributed to the deceased were in fact said. Such support, it was submitted, was contained in the transcripts of the conversations obtained by listening device, as well as in the content of Dawson's interview.
 
108Having considered all of the evidence I am not satisfied that the offender was provoked by the conduct of the deceased.

109For the reasons I have already expressed, I formed the view that the offender was unreliable in a number of aspects of his evidence. The fact that he may have made reference, in a conversation with Grant (contained in Track 58 of Disc 49) to the words allegedly said by the deceased does not cause me to change that view. I accept that Dawson also made reference to the issue at lines 8 - 18 at page 16 of her interview with the police on 11 January 2011. Again, for the reasons I have already expressed, I attach no weight to untested assertions of that nature. For these reasons I am not satisfied that the words attributed to the deceased were in fact said.

110In any event, and even if the evidence established that the words in question were said by the deceased, I do not accept that they provoked the offender to kill the deceased as he did. 
 
111In the final answer in cross-examination by counsel for Dawson, and in his answer to the Crown's very first question in cross examination, the offender admitted that he:

(a) had pulled on the rope and killed the deceased;
(b) had done so because he was angry; and
(c) was angry because of what his mother had told him about the deceased's behaviour.

112In giving that evidence, the offender did not attribute his act of killing the deceased to anything said or done by the deceased towards him. The fact that he did not do so is completely consistent with a conversation (in Disc 21) in which he explained the reasons for killing the deceased as follows: 

"" I done it. I thought that cunt was, raped me mum. I thought that cunt had touched me kids. That's why I done it"". 

113Once again, there was no reference to anything said or done by the deceased to the offender himself as having provoked the offender into acting as he did. On the basis of that conversation, the offender killed the deceased because of what he had been told by Dawson. That is consistent with the evidence given by the offender before the jury, and to which I have referred. 

114As previously outlined, the offender also asserted in the course of his evidence that the deceased was ""smiling and smirking"" as he said the words attributed to him and that he (the offender) somehow construed this as an admission by the deceased that he had acted inappropriately. This was so, notwithstanding that on the offender's evidence the deceased had spent some time, in face of being assaulted by the offender and Dawson, denying that any wrongdoing had taken place. The offender also agreed that these actions of the deceased assumed considerable importance in his (the offender's) own mind, but that he had omitted any reference to it when spoken to by the police. His explanation for that omission was that he did not think it would matter. In view of the importance which the offender himself attached to those actions on the part of the deceased, his explanation for making no reference to it when spoken to by the police is a wholly implausible one, and is one which I reject. It is a further demonstration of the offender's unreliability. I am not satisfied that the deceased smiled and smirked at the offender at any time. 

115For all of these reasons, I am not satisfied that the deceased engaged in any behaviour towards the offender which amounts to provocation.

116Counsel for the offender submitted that the ""hearsay provocation"" should be regarded as provocation within the meaning of s. 23A(3)(c) of the Sentencing Act. In my view, that is not correct. Tension and general enmity between parties leading up to an offence, and which forms part of the overall circumstances in which an offence was committed, does not constitute evidence of provocation sufficient to amount to mitigation: see Shaw v R [2008] NSWCCA 58 at [26]. In my view, and in the context of a case such as the present, the provocation contemplated by s. 23A(3)(c) is provocation constituted by the conduct of a deceased towards an offender, as distinct from reports of the conduct of a deceased towards someone else which are conveyed to an offender. 

117However, counsel for the offender also relied upon the ""hearsay provocation"" on what I understood to be a slightly different basis. Specifically, counsel submitted that I should find that as a result of what he had been told by Dawson about the deceased's behaviour, the offender was ""incited into believing that his children had been abused"". 

118The offender gave evidence that he went to Red Range ""because (he) wanted to find out (himself) if it was true about someone touching (his) boys"" (at T 457 line 38). He also said (at T 459 line 35 - 40) that there was a conversation between himself and Dawson on the way to Red Range about ""all the stuff that (the deceased) had done"". In my view, that evidence supports a conclusion that the catalyst for the offender's decision to travel to Red Range, and to become involved in the enterprise which resulted in the deceased's death, was information conveyed to him by Dawson. I did not understand the Crown to argue to the contrary.

119However, even accepting this to be the case, it is a circumstance which assists the offender to a limited degree. The more important considerations are that, as expressly conceded by counsel for the offender, the killing of the deceased which followed occurred in circumstances where there was (inter alia): 

(a)at the very least, a contemplation on the part of the offender that violence would be visited upon the deceased; and

(b)preparation on the part of the offender, both in terms of the recruitment of another person and the obtaining of weapons to take with him.

120Moreover, when informed by Dawson about the deceased's alleged behaviour, the offender had more than one option open to him. He took the option of going to Red Range, in circumstances where it is accepted that in doing so, he acted in the manner set out in [49] above. He impermissibly took the law into his own hands, exacted physical revenge upon the deceased, and killed him, intending to do so. The offender's original decision to go to Red Range may be explained, to some degree, by what Dawson had told him about the deceased. However, that provides no excuse for his conduct. In all of these circumstances, personal and general deterrence both have a role to play in sentencing the offender (see R v Buddle [2005] NSWCCA 82 at [11] per Wood CJ at CL.

The offender's criminal history
121The offender's criminal history in New South Wales is limited to two matters, the first being an offence of steal from person, and the second being an offence of having custody of a knife in a public place. Both of these offences were committed at the same time, and both were dealt with by the Local Court in 2007. The first originally resulted in the imposition of 12 months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 6 months. That non-parole period was reduced to 3 months on appeal. The second matter resulted in the imposition of a fine, and was not the subject of an appeal.

122The Crown tendered the statement of facts relating to these matters, from which it was clear that both arose from the one set of circumstances. In short, the incident involved the theft of a purse, by the offender, from an 83 year old lady who had just withdrawn an amount of cash from an automatic teller machine in the town of Ballina. Although the offender was in possession of a knife at the time, there was no suggestion that he used it to threaten or harm the victim, nor did he commit any other act of violence. The offender was apprehended by members of the public shortly after the theft and in a subsequent interview with the police he made full admissions. In one of the recorded conversations tendered on the offender's behalf in these proceedings (in Disc 10) the offender was recorded telling Grant that at the time of the commission of these offences he was living in his car and needed money.

123The only remaining matter in the offender's criminal history stems from an appearance before a Children's Court in Western Australia in 2000 for a burglary offence in respect of which no conviction was recorded. 


124In my view, in these circumstances, the offender should be regarded as having no significant criminal history. That is a mitigating factor.

Prospects of rehabilitation and likelihood of re-offending
125It was submitted that the offending on this occasion should be viewed as having arisen in particular circumstances which were unlikely to be repeated. I accept that the circumstances were somewhat unique and in the absence of any substantial criminal history, I accept the submission of counsel for the offender that there are ""some"" prospects of rehabilitation. The likelihood of re-offending may well be dependent upon the offender obtaining treatment for the disorders diagnosed by Dr Kasinathan, and continuing the anti-depressant treatment which he is obtaining whilst in custody.

Remorse
126Counsel for the offender submitted that I should find that the offender had expressed remorse in a number of the conversations recorded by listening device. 

127In one of the transcripts tendered at the trial (exhibit L 34) the offender was recorded saying:

""Made me do this to the other fucking putrid maggot paedophile rapist dog. The next fucking paedophile rapist dog will get the same fucking treatment from me and the fucking next one after that too. Every paedophile should be dead. Every rapist should be dead"".

128In another conversation (exhibit L 36) the offender was recorded saying:

""I'm really going to fuck people up now. Cool hey? I can't wait till the next cunt that fucks me over. What else am I supposed to do if they get away with it?""

129In exhibit L 44 the offender described his killing of the deceased in the following terms: 

""I tied a rope. Dave was standing there like a bitch. I seen a piece of rope and tied a noose, put it straight around the cunt's neck and I stood on his fucking shoulder and pulled it"".

130In a further conversation (recorded at track 58 of Disc 49, a transcript of which was tendered by counsel for the offender) the offender is recorded as saying:

""Well, the cunt did deserve it"".

131The offender was also cross-examined in relation to correspondence which had passed between he and Dawson following the deceased's death, whilst each of them was in custody. In one letter (exhibit 1) the offender wrote to Dawson:

""I'm OK doing the time because I was the one that killed that old rotten dog"".

132In a further letter (exhibit 5) the offender wrote:

""Hey, I'm glad your legal team is helping you, but I did talk to my legal team and I'm going to be fucked. I'm getting a real good whack. It does not matter, but I'm just going to plead guilty to murder. It was all worth it to me because of what that old dirty cunt's done"".

133In a further letter to Dawson (exhibit 6) the offender wrote:
""..... I was the one who killed Adrian, so I should pay for what I have done, not anyone else"". 

134Section 21A(3)(i) of the Sentencing Act permits a court to take into account, on sentence, remorse which is shown by an offender, but only if: 

(a)the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions; and

(b)the offender has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions, or made reparation for such injury.

135In written submissions, Counsel for the offender argued that the offender had ""expressed considerable remorse in his letters to his mother following the murder"". In oral submissions, counsel advanced the general proposition that the offender had expressed ""very strong remorse"" about what he had done. 

136The contents of exhibit 6, and the offender's reference to the fact that he should ""pay"" for what he had done, exhibit some degree of acceptance of responsibility. Beyond that, the submissions made on behalf of the offender concerning remorse are, in my view, fundamentally at odds with the evidence generally, and with the contents of exhibit 1, exhibit 5, and the conversation in Disc 49 in particular. 

137Statements by the offender that deceased's murder was ""worth it"", and that the deceased ""deserved it"" are, in my view, the antithesis of expressions of remorse. A similar observation may be made regarding the derogatory and offensive terms in which the offender described the deceased, both in the recorded conversations with Grant and his correspondence with his mother. For these reasons, I am not satisfied that there has been any remorse expressed by the offender.
 
Special circumstances
138Finally, and although it was initially raised, counsel for the offender did not maintain the submission that I should make a finding of special circumstances. In this regard counsel, as I understood it, acknowledged that there would necessarily be a lengthy period of parole.

conclusion
139The offender has been in custody since his arrest on 5 January 2011. It is agreed that any sentence I impose should be backdated to commence on that date.

140The offender is sentenced to a non-parole period of 21 years imprisonment, commencing on 5 January 2011 and ending on 4 January 2032, with an additional term of 7 years imprisonment commencing on 5 January 2032 and ending on 4 January 2039.

141The total term is one of 28 years imprisonment.

142The offender will be eligible for parole on 5 January 2032 and his sentence will expire on 4 January 2039.

		10 May 2013",2013-05-09 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2706762,RH v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2013] NSWSC 520,"Judgment
1HIS HONOUR:  Nature of proceedingsThe plaintiff proceeds by way of amended summons for the following orders:
1. An order pursuant to s51B rule 6(2)(a) Supreme Court Rules 1970 extending time for the institution of the appeal to 18 October 2012.
2. An order pursuant to s55(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 setting aside the plaintiff's conviction.
2The appeal is brought pursuant to s52(1) of that Act from a decision of his Honour Mr Dunlevy LCM of 6 July 2012 in which he convicted the plaintiff of the offence of aggravated break and enter contrary to s112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 which was said to have occurred between 1 and 2 October 2010.  At the time, his Honour was sitting as the Wentworth Children's Court.
3No objection was raised by the defendant to time being extended for the hearing of the appeal.  Accordingly, I make that order.
4It was common ground that for the appeal to succeed, the Court had to be satisfied that the decision of his Honour was affected by legal error (Fleet v District Court of NSW [1999] NSWCA 363 at [59]).
5The grounds of appeal were:
Ground 1 - The Magistrate erred in law in finding that there was evidence capable of rebutting beyond a reasonable doubt the presumption of doli incapax.
Ground 2 - The Magistrate erred in law in applying an objective test to the question of whether the presumption of doli incapax was rebutted beyond reasonable doubt.
Ground 3 - The Magistrate erred in law in relying on factual matters that constituted no more than the commission of the offence itself to rebut the presumption of doli incapax.
6No objection was taken by the defendant to the competency of the appeal, i.e. that it did not raise a question of law.  Accordingly, the appeal proceeded on that basis.
Factual background
7There was no issue as to the relevant facts.  There was no issue that between 8pm on 1 October and 5am on 2 October 2010 at Xxxxxx RH did break and enter the Xxxxxx Fire Station and did steal property belonging to the New South Wales Fire Service in circumstances of aggravation, i.e. that he was in company with another person being his cousin S.
8RH was aged 12 at the time.  The only issue in the appeal was whether the evidence before his Honour was sufficient to rebut the presumption of doli incapax in favour of RH.  
9That evidence was relevantly:  
Investigating Police observed several jemmy marks on the rear door of the main office building of the Xxxxxx Rural Fire Station.  The lock on the door of a smaller building, which consisted of an office and storage area, had been jemmied open and the office area had been ""ransacked"".
A silver ACER laptop computer had been stolen from the office area and several rulers, balloons and cans of soft drink had been stolen from the storage area.
Investigating Police went to the residence of RH.  Within a few minutes of searching, one of the Police officers located rulers with the Rural Fire Service logo on them.  In the lounge-room, inside a television cabinet, one of the Police officers located a silver ACER laptop computer.  There was no issue that these items had been stolen from the Rural Fire Service station on the evening of 1 - 2 October 2010.
In early October 2010 SH, the mother of RH, noticed some rulers with ""Fire Brigade"" written on them and little packets of coloured pencils in the kitchen.  She thought that these had been given to RH by the firemen.  When she learned that a computer belonging to the Rural Fire Service had been found in the house, she became very angry and subsequently spoke to RH.  Included in the conversation was:
""I said ""where did the computer come from?""  R said ""Don't blame me, baby S.""
CK was a cousin of RH and was aged 15.  At about 9 or 10pm at night early in October 2010, he was asleep in his bedroom with the window ajar when he heard RH say ""I got drinks and that here, I got them from the fire station, I broke in there, I was in with all the fire trucks, I was searching looking for money.  I found drinks and balloons and rulers.  Me and S got them"".
RS then came in through the window and sat near the bed.  CK turned on the light and could see that RH had three or four cans of Coke in both his pockets.  The next day, CK saw RH walking towards him and could see that he was throwing a large bag of balloons up in the air.  The balloons then fell on the ground and then he jumped on the bag and the balloons went all over the road.  CK looked at the balloons and could see the word ""Fire"" written on one of them.  RH left the balloons lying in the road and said to CK ""Look at I got, I got them last night, I got them from the Fire Station in Xxxxxx"".
A few days later, CK was speaking to the sister and cousin of RH.  When he asked about RH, he was told ""He's at home playing the computer he stole"".
10There were photographs of some of the stolen property, but there were no photographs of where that property was found.  In particular, there was no photograph of the television cabinet, inside which the computer was found.
11The reasons of his Honour were as follows:
""Because these are Children's Court proceedings and because of the age of the young person, the Police are also required to rebut the presumption of doli incapax in relation to the young person.  In that regard, the Police are required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the young person knew what he was doing was very wrong or seriously wrong and not merely mischievous.  The Prosecution are not required to prove that he knew what he was doing was criminally wrong.  
On this issue, a doli incapax cannot be rebutted merely by virtue of the commission of the offence itself.  Even if the offence seems quite heinous in nature.  And so in examining this issue, the Court does have to go beyond proof of the mere elements of the offence, however, the Court can take into account other facts which are relevant to the commission of the offence and I will refer to that issue very shortly.
...
Thus, the only other element which I need to consider is whether the Police can rebut the presumption of doli incapax.  In that regard, I again note the guidance that I provided to myself at the start of this judgment.
In terms of the offence itself, it is notable that the offence was committed on a fire station that is an Emergency Services building.  That lends an additional sinister aspect to this case.  It marks it as being a very wrong act.
It is also the case that the premises were forcefully entered with the lock, and it was padlocked, being jemmied open.  That adds another additional sinister element to this offence.  It is not for instance the case that the young person has just snuck in by opening an unlocked door.
In addition to that, another reason why I feel that this offence goes beyond mere mischief or being naughty and can obviously be seen to be very wrong and very much a culpable act is that the office was ransacked and so the young person committing this offence has not just gone in and taken a number of items.  He has severely messed up the place so to speak.
The young person has then also subsequently made some attempts to secrete a number of items which he took.  The young person also, in talking to CK, appears to be boasting about what he has done.
I am, therefore, satisfied that there are other aspects of this case that go beyond the mere commission of the offence itself and the elements itself and there are other aspects of the facts which lend the commission of this offence a much more sinister air and one which, of themselves, in my view, are sufficient to rebut doli incapax.  The actions of the young person go beyond being naughty or even very naughty.  They are very serious acts.  Not acts of mischief and, in my view, obviously criminal acts.
I have also taken into account the young person's maturity.  He is not that young and by the age of twelve he should be well aware that you cannot break into fire stations, particularly in the modern era of universal education, access to the internet, television, radio and so on.
And so, again, conglomerating all of those conclusions I find that doli incapax has been negatived by the prosecution and so, therefore, each element that the prosecution are required to prove has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.""
Applicable Legal Principles
12The presumption was comprehensively examined in C (A Minor) v Director of Public Prosecutions [1996] 1 AC 1.  Lord Lowry (with whom the other Lords agreed) delivered the leading judgment.  Having examined authority and the arguments both in favour and against the presumption, his Lordship said at 38C:
""A long and uncontradicted line of authority makes two propositions clear.  The first is that the prosecution must prove that the child defendant did the act charged and that when doing that act, he knew that it was wrong as to distinct from an act of mere naughtiness or childish mischief.  The criminal standard of proof applies.  What is required has been variously expressed, as in Blackstone, ""strong and clear beyond all doubt or contradiction"", or, in Rex v Gorrie (1918) 83 JP 136, ""very clear and complete evidence"" or, in B v R (1958) 44 Cr App R 1,3 per Lord Parker CJ, ""it has often been put in this way, that ... ""guilty knowledge must be proved and the evidence to that effect must be clear and beyond all possibility of doubt"".""
No doubt, the emphatic tone of some of the directions was due to the Court's anxiety to prevent mere naughty children from being convicted of crimes and in a sterner age, to protect them from the draconian consequences of conviction.  
The second clearly established proposition is that evidence to prove the defendant's guilty knowledge, as defined above, must not be the mere proof of the doing of the act charged, however horrifying or obviously wrong that act may be.  As Erle J said in Reg v Smith (Sidney) (1845) 1 Cox C C 260:
""A guilty knowledge that he was doing wrong - must be proved by the evidence, and cannot be presumed from the mere commission of the act.  You are to determine from a review of the evidence whether it is satisfactorily proved that at the time he fired the rick (if you should be of the opinion he did fire it) he had a guilty knowledge that he was committing a crime.""
The report of Rex v Kershaw (1902) 18 TLR 357, 358, where a boy of thirteen was charged with murder, states:
""His Lordship [Bucknill J], in summing up, pointed out that the commission of a crime was in itself no evidence whatever of the guilty state of mind which is essential before a child between the ages of 7 and 14 can be condemned.""
In that case the jury found the prisoner guilty of manslaughter and he was sentenced to 10 years penal servitude.
The cases seem to show, logically enough, that the older the defendant is and the more obviously wrong the act, the easier it will generally be to prove guilty knowledge.  The surrounding circumstances are of course relevant and what the defendant said or did before or after the act may go to prove his guilty mind.  Running away is usually equivocal, as Laws J rightly said it was in the present case, because flight from the scene can as easily follow a naughty action as a wicked one.  There must, however, be a few cases where running away would indicate guilty knowledge, where an act is either wrong or innocent and there is no room for mere naughtiness.  An example might be selling drugs at a street corner and fleeing at the sight of a policeman.""
13In reaching that conclusion Lord Lowry considered the application of the presumption in circumstances where it had been assumed in the court below that the minor charged was a person of ordinary intelligence.   At 33D his Lordship said:
""4.  The rule is said to be illogical because the presumption can be rebutted by proof that the child was of normal mental capacity for his age; this leads to the conclusion that every child is initially presumed not to be of normal mental capacity for his age, which is absurd.  This argument involves a point which I must deal with when considering the second part of the certified question (how to prove that the child is doli capax), but at this stage I will focus on the illogicality.  We start with a benevolent presumption of doli incapax, the purpose of which was to protect children between 7 (now by statute 10) and 14 years from the full rigour of the criminal law.  The fact that the presumption was rebuttable has led the courts to recognise that the older the child (see B v R 44 CR App R 1,3) and the more obviously heinous the offence, the easier it is to rebut the presumption.  Proof of mental normality has in practice (understandably but perhaps not always logically) been largely accepted as proof that the child can distinguish right from wrong and form a criminal intent.  The presumption itself is not, and never has been, completely logical; it provides a benevolent safeguard which evidence can remove.  Very little evidence is needed, but it must be adduced as part of the prosecution's case or else there will be no case to answer.""
14The decision in C v DPP was subjected to strong criticism by the Victorian Court of Appeal (Callaway and Batt JJA and Cummins AJA) in R v ALH [2003] VSCA 129; 6 VR 276.  In particular, Callaway JA at [19] - [20] considered that the decision in C v DPP was ""unduly restrictive"" and had produced ""absurdities"".  Cummins AJA expressed opinions to similar effect at [85] - [86].  Batt JA agreed with those criticisms.
15In deciding this matter, however, I sit as part of the judicial hierarchy of NSW.  The leading cases in this State are Regina v CRH (NSWCCA, 18 December 1996, unreported, (Smart, Newman and Hidden JJ)) and BP v Regina; SW v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 172 (Hodgson JA, Adams and Johnson JJ).
16In Regina v CRH Newman J (with whom Smart and Hidden JJ agreed) said:""In short, it is my view that such Australian authority as exists is consistent with the law as expressed by Lord Lowry in C.  This is the law of Australia.  That being so, as I have said, the evidence was insufficient to rebut the presumption of doli incapax having regard to the criminal standard of proof.""
17In BP and SW, Hodgson JA (with whom Adams and Johnson JJ agreed) said:
""27 The common law concerning the criminal responsibility of children has been modified in New South Wales by s5 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (which provides for a conclusive presumption that no child under the age of 10 years can be guilty of an offence), but not otherwise. Accordingly, as regards a child between 10 and 14 years, there remains a presumption that such a child is doli incapax, that is incapable of committing a crime because of lack of understanding of the difference between right and wrong, and consequential lack of mens rea. It is clear that when a child between 10 and 14 years is accused of a crime, the onus is on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt not only that the child did the act charged, accompanied by the necessary mental element, but also that, when doing it, he or she knew it was seriously wrong, as distinct from an act of mere naughtiness or mischief: The Queen v M (1977) 16 SASR 589; C v DPP [1996] 1 AC 1 at 38; R v CRH, NSWCCA, 18/12/96; R v ALH (2003) 6 VR 276.
28  The child must know that the act is seriously wrong as a matter of morality, or according to the ordinary principles of reasonable persons, not that it is a crime or contrary to law: Stapleton v The Queen (1952) 86 CLR 358, The Queen v M.
29  It has been said that evidence to prove the child's guilty knowledge must not be the mere proof of doing the act charged, however horrifying or obviously wrong the act may be: C v DPP at 38. This was said in CRH to represent the common law of Australia; but it was strongly disapproved by the Victorian Court of Appeal in R v ALH at [20] and [85]-[86]. However, on either view, the circumstances of the offence, such as concern to avoid detection, may be some evidence of knowledge; although, if the concern is consistent with the child thinking that the act is merely naughty, this will carry little weight.
30  It is not necessary to resolve this conflict in this case, because there was evidence in addition to the mere doing of the acts charged. However, I would say that, even if the view expressed in C v DPP and CRH is correct, there should not be a narrow view taken on what are circumstances of the offence that can operate as evidence. For example, in the present case, assuming the jury accepted LD's evidence that she was crying and screaming and struggling and asking BP to stop, these would in my opinion be factors that could support the inference that BP knew that what he was doing was causing great distress to another human being and as such was seriously wrong.  That evidence, coupled with the evidence that BP asked SW to stop LD screaming, that BP continued what he was doing after LD said she would tell the police, and the statement of Ms Dockrill, was in my opinion plainly sufficient to base a finding by the jury, beyond reasonable doubt, that BP had sufficient understanding of the wrongness of his conduct.""
18It should be noted that in BP and SW evidence was given by a teacher and by a psychologist as to the level of intelligence of the appellants in that case.
19In resolving this matter, I propose to apply the law as stated by Hodgson JA in BP and SW.  In my opinion, his Honour's statement of the law is not only consistent with authority, but is appropriately tempered by common sense.
Submissions and consideration
20The first point made by the plaintiff related to the second ground of appeal, i.e., that his Honour had applied an objective test to the question of whether the presumption was rebutted.  That ground of appeal was directed to the observation by his Honour at T.6.1 (6 July 2012) where he said:
""I have also taken into account the young person's maturity.  He is not that young and by the age of 12 he should be well aware that you cannot break into fire stations, particularly in the modern era of universal education, access to the internet, television, radio and so on.""
21The plaintiff submitted that there was no evidence before his Honour which would justify a conclusion that his level of maturity was that of a normal 12 year old and that accordingly, he should be treated as such.  The plaintiff submitted that C v DPP made it clear that the prosecution could not assume normal or average intelligence, but that this was a matter which had to be proved.
22It was common ground that the relevant test was a subjective one and concerned the state of mind of the particular minor.  It could not be applied on the basis of what a normal child of 12 would have known or thought.
23The only evidence before his Honour as to the plaintiff's level of maturity was the response to his mother when she challenged him about where the computer came from and whether his sister was there, the conversation with his older cousin, CK, that night and on the following day and the comment by his sister that ""He's at home playing the computer he stole"".  Was it open to his Honour to infer from that evidence that the level of maturity of the plaintiff was that of a normal 12 year old.  I have concluded, not without some hesitation, that it was not open.  The evidence concerning ""playing the computer"" could refer to very basic operations of it.
24I should observe that not much more evidence would have been required to enable his Honour to properly draw the inference which he did.  Evidence from the plaintiff's mother concerning his performance at school or his behaviour generally, would have been sufficient.  Absent that sort of evidence, I agree with the plaintiff that this finding by his Honour as to his maturity was not open and that that aspect of the appeal has been made out.
25This does not end the matter.  What it means is that when considering the evidence which was before his Honour, I have to ignore that finding.   The question remains whether by reference to the evidence as a whole, it was still open to his Honour to find that the presumption had been rebutted.  Put another way, had the Crown on the evidence established beyond reasonable doubt that RH knew that what he did at the fire station was seriously wrong as distinct from an act of mere naughtiness or mischief.
26Two matters which his Honour took into account as important were that the object of the break in was a fire station and that the premises were entered by breaking open a padlock by use of a jemmy, as distinct from sneaking into premises which were otherwise unattended.  The plaintiff submitted that these were not matters which could be properly taken into account by his Honour since they constituted the ""mere proof of the doing of the act charged"" as referred to in C v DPP.
27I do not agree.  Read in context, the observation in C v DPP was to the effect that it was not sufficient to rely only upon the matters charged.  That is not the case here.  In any event, as already indicated, I prefer the approach of Hodgson JA in BP and SW to the effect that ""there should not be a narrow view taken on what are circumstances of the offence that can operate as evidence"".
28The importance of the object of the break-in being a fire station was that it would have been appreciated by the plaintiff that the fire station existed for a specific purpose and that he was not meant to be there.  That he was aware of this fact, emerges from statements which he made to CK.  Of more significance is the use of a jemmy to break open the padlock.  I have concluded that it was well open to his Honour to conclude that this was something which could be taken into account with other circumstances to indicate an awareness on the part of the plaintiff that what he was doing was seriously wrong.  This was an obviously wrongful act which required some planning, i.e., having a jemmy available.
29The third matter relied upon by his Honour was that the office had been ""ransacked"".  It was open to his Honour to take that matter into account with other facts.  The difficulty for his Honour, and for this Court, is that what was meant by the word ""ransack"" was never explained by the two police officers who used it.  In the absence of any explanation, I would not be prepared to interpret the word as indicating anything more than it was obvious to an observer that drawers and cupboards had been opened (and perhaps left open) consistent with the search for money, which was one of the plaintiff's purposes in breaking into the premises.
30The next matter which his Honour took into account was that the plaintiff had made some attempts to secrete a number of the items which he took.  I agree with the submission by the plaintiff that such a finding was problematic.  The evidence from his mother was that there were rulers with ""Fire Brigade"" written on them and little packets of coloured pencils in the kitchen.  There does not seem to have been any attempt to hide those.  The police officers who searched the home had no difficulty in finding a number of Rural Fire rulers in a hallway cabinet.  The only evidence concerning the finding of the laptop was that it was located ""inside a television cabinet"".   There was no evidence of a description of the cabinet or of where in the cabinet it was found.  I have concluded that it was not open to his Honour to find that the plaintiff had ""made some attempts to secrete a number of items which he took"".
31The most important evidence from the point of view of the prosecution was the statements made by the plaintiff to CK.  His Honour characterised those statements as ""boasting about what he has done"".  The statements do bear that characterisation and it is difficult to see what other purpose RH had in going to the home of CK late at night and telling him about what he had done.  That was a finding open to his Honour.  
32It is, however, the actual words used by the plaintiff which I consider are of particular significance in determining his state of knowledge.  The words were ""I got drinks and that here, I got them from the fire station, I broke in there, I was in with all the fire trucks, I was searching looking for money.  I found drinks and balloons and rulers.  Me and S got 'em"".  The next day he said to CK ""Look at I got, I got them last night, I got them from the fire station in Xxxxxx"".  
33The plaintiff submitted that the words ""I was in with all the fire trucks"" was the sort of expression a young and immature person would use.  That may be so, but it says nothing about his understanding of whether what he was doing was seriously wrong.  On the other hand, the statements ""I broke in there""; ""I was searching looking for money.  I found drinks and balloons and rulers.  Me and  S got 'em"" make it clear that the plaintiff understood that what he was doing was seriously wrong.  He was breaking into a fire station with the intention of looking for money and anything else of value.  On the basis of that evidence, it was well open to his Honour to find that the plaintiff understood that these were seriously wrongful acts and not acts of mischief.
34When one leaves out his Honour's finding as to the plaintiff's maturity, and when one leaves out the finding that the plaintiff made some effort to hide the items which he stole, was there sufficient evidence to allow his Honour to find beyond reasonable doubt that the plaintiff knew that what he was doing was seriously wrong and was not merely mischievous. In my opinion, there was sufficient evidence and it was open to his Honour to make such a finding.  The plaintiff's understanding of ""breaking in"" with his intention of ""searching looking for money"" is decisive.
Conclusion
35It follows from the above that the appeal should be dismissed.
36The orders which I make are as follows:
(1) I extend time for the bringing of the appeal pursuant to Pt 51B rule 6 Supreme Court Rules 1970.
(2) I dismiss the appeal.
(3) I make no order as to costs.

		10 May 2013",2013-05-09 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2706766,R v Ahola (No 4) [2013] NSWSC 701,"EX TEMPORE Judgment

1An application was made some days ago by the Crown Prosecutor to uplift three exhibits in this murder trial. The first is exhibit K, namely the shirt taken from the accused on 19 October 2011; the second is exhibit L, the denim shorts taken from the accused on the same date; and the third is exhibit M, the thongs taken from the accused, again on the same date.

2This morning the Crown Prosecutor has indicated that, on reflection, he does not seek to uplift exhibit M, the thongs.

3The application is opposed by defence counsel on three bases. First, it is said that there is a procedural unfairness in the testing at this stage of the trial, because many months ago the accused had indicated to the police that his position was that there was paint, as opposed to blood, on at least one of the items he was wearing when they were taken from him on 19 October 2011.

4The second basis is that the testing will inevitably interfere with two exhibits that are already before the jury, and that, in accordance with usual practice, have been into the jury room during the adjournments already.

5In short, the foundation of this aspect of the resistance to the items being uplifted is that the integrity of the exhibits already in evidence and placed before the jury should not be interfered with.

6The third basis of resistance is that, inevitably, if the exhibits are manifestly interfered with, something will have to be said to the jury about the fact that they have been tested. It is submitted that that occurring at this stage of the trial, especially in light of the cross-examination by defence counsel, would have an adverse and prejudicial impact upon the accused.

Chronology

7In order to understand the issues, and in particular the procedural unfairness ground of resistance, it is necessary for me to recount a little of the chronology, not only of the evidence that has been tendered so far in the trial and on the voir dire, but also a chronology of some of the aspects of the proceedings themselves.

8The offence is said to have occurred on 18 October 2011 in the township of Malua Bay. The Crown case is that the accused brutally assaulted the deceased and caused her death by way of a large number of blows to the head and neck. 

9An important part of the Crown case is analysis of the pattern of blood, not only found at the scene and on the body of the deceased, but also an analysis of the pattern of red material said to be blood observed upon the body of the accused and his clothing on 18 and 19 October.

10At 10.34pm on 18 October 2011 a triple-0 call was received at Batemans Bay Police Station from the accused, informing them of the situation of the deceased being very badly injured and in the bathroom of her home.

11Police attended, and at the scene the accused spoke to Senior Constables McLean, Schmidt and Quick. Some of the things said by the accused were rejected by me on the voir dire. The accused said some things about his appearance, including what appeared to be blood upon him.

12In neither the material tendered in the voir dire nor the lesser material received in the trial did the accused say to any of those three police officers that any of the material observed upon him or upon his clothes was paint.

13Early in the morning of 19 October 2011, the accused engaged in a forensic procedure with Detective Hollands. That took place between 3am and 3.26am, and the transcript of that procedure became exhibit 14 on the voir dire as part of the Crown case.

14Some aspects of what the accused said to Detective Hollands during that process were also cross-examined into evidence in the trial by defence counsel.

15During the forensic procedure, the accused said a number of things as to his appearance. In particular, at the bottom of page 5, he said, ""By the way half that red stuff on the thongs is actually red oxide"". A little later he said, ""I was painting my bloody verandah."" And a little later he said, ""Just that it doesn't look as bad as it are.""

16At the bottom of page 6 of the transcript the accused is recorded as having said, ""There's blood splatters on my feet"", and a little later, ""Most of the red marks on the bottoms are red oxide.""

17It is noteworthy that, although it is certainly clear that, in the early hours of 19 October 2011, the accused was asserting to the police that some at least of the red marks on his thongs, and perhaps his feet, were in truth paint, he did not make any such assertion with regard to his shirt or his shorts.

18Between 5.26am and 7.05am on 19 October 2011, the accused engaged in an ERISP with police. He was asked 563 questions and chose to answer all of them. Throughout that ERISP he said nothing about the presence of paint on his clothes or on his person.

19At questions and answers 464 to 467, the following exchange occurred:

""Q464 O.K. I noted when we conducted a forensic, the forensic procedure on you earlier tonight - - -

A Yes.

Q465 - - - and the other crime scene officer took the photographs - - -

A Yes.

Q466 - - - there appeared to be some blood or some blood spatter on the top of your feet?

A Yes, yes.

Q467 Can you explain to me how that would have come to be there?

A Well, I've got no idea.""

20The accused was subsequently released and re-arrested on 20 October 2011, and charged with murder. On arrest, on legal advice, he exercised his right to silence.

21I am informed that a paper committal was conducted in the Local Court before the matter was committed to this court for trial. In other words, there was no cross-examination or submissions as to whether or not anything could be paint, as opposed to blood, at that stage.

22It seems that when initially arraigned in this court, in the arraignments list, there was no reference made to any question as to whether what may have been assumed to be blood was in fact paint.

23Similarly, when the matter was mentioned before me, defence counsel did not point to the possibility of that question being an issue in the trial, though I hasten to add that I made it perfectly clear to both parties at that stage that there was no responsibility on defence counsel to indicate any issue in the trial if he did not wish to do so.

24On 29 April 2013, the accused was arraigned before a jury panel and me on a single count of murder.

25Defence counsel exercised his right to open to the jury and at T26.6 of the trial transcript, the following is recorded. Defence counsel said ""But the principal issues in this trial are firstly, who was it who killed the deceased, secondly, the interpretation of the blood spatter,"" and then defence counsel went on to mention two other issues that are not presently relevant.

26At T31.16, in the same opening, defence counsel said ""The interpretation of the blood spatter that will be an issue in the trial I anticipate"", and then again he went on to discuss other issues not presently relevant.

27It can be seen that, although ""the blood spatter"" was identified as an issue, as was its interpretation, it was not at that stage revealed that it would be an issue for the jury as to whether or not the underlying material was either blood or paint.

28The trial proceeded with the calling of various civilian and police witnesses.

29On 6 May 2013, Mr Sergejeff, a longstanding friend of the accused, was called by the Crown. In cross-examination by defence counsel, he agreed that some days before the accused travelled from Tarcutta to Malua Bay (that is, some days before 18 October 2011) the accused had been engaged in painting some items with red oxide paint. Four photos were tendered in support of that proposition and became defence exhibit 2 in the trial.

30It was quite open to infer from the evidence of Mr Sergejeff in crossexamination that the proposition was being placed before the jury that it was not just the thongs of the accused that could have had red paint on them, but also his shirt and shorts. And I am prepared to infer that it became clear from that moment on to everyone in court who was following the evidence that the issue of whether or not the red material found on the body of the accused and his items of clothing was in fact all blood, but in truth could possibly be paint, had been clearly raised.

31Prior to that cross-examination, defence counsel had not sought from me an advance ruling pursuant to s 192A of the Evidence Act 1995 as to what, if any, consequences could flow from that course of cross-examination.

32In particular, there was no advance ruling sought as to whether or not that cross-examination could lead to the Crown leading evidence that had not previously been notified as to the true nature of the red material.

33The Crown re-examined Mr Sergejeff adversely, if I may call it that, but there was no application to cross-examine him by the Crown Prosecutor pursuant to s 38 of the Evidence Act on the basis that he had given unfavourable evidence.

34On 7 May 2013 the shirt and the shorts were tendered through Detective Hollands, the Crime Scene Officer and, as I have said, became exhibits K and L.

35On 8 May 2013, the Crown applied to uplift the exhibits and made it clear that what was proposed was that there would be a further testing of them to determine the true nature of the red material. That was opposed by defence counsel.

36The resolution of the question was stood over until today to permit the smooth running of the trial, and also to permit the thinking of both parties and me to evolve.

37On the same day, defence counsel cross-examined into the trial from Detective Hollands some, but not all, of the things said by the accused during the forensic procedure in the early hours of 19 October 2011.

38Defence counsel also obtained in cross-examination from Detective Hollands, in effect, an agreement that the stains or spots on the thongs were ""potentially of a similar colour"" to what was depicted in the four photographs in exhibit 2.

39Finally with regard to my chronological review of the evidence in the trial and voir dire with regard to procedural aspects, I was informed by the Crown Prosecutor that the transcript of the forensic procedure was not in his brief. However, it was in the brief of defence counsel when he received it from another barrister.

40Finally, defence counsel has informed me that for his part the items in question have never been sought for expert testing.

Submissions

41Turning to the submissions of defence counsel, it is accepted that, with regard to procedural unfairness, the accused referred explicitly in the forensic procedure only to the possible presence of paint on the thongs, and that he said nothing about the presence of paint on the shirt or the shorts. 

42However, what was submitted was that the police should have inferred that that was a possibility, and had the items tested months ago.

43It was submitted that, in short, forensic decisions were made by defence counsel based upon the material that he had been led to understand was in the prosecution brief. And the police, in that indirect way at least, were indeed on notice that the true nature of the red material could very much be an issue in the trial.

44In all of the circumstances, he submitted, it would be quite unfair now for the Crown to seek, after Mr Sergejeff had been cross-examined, to ""fix up"" the potential problem that has arisen in the Crown case.

45The second ground of resistance was that inevitably the testing will involve an interference with the integrity of the exhibits that have already been tendered, received into evidence, and inspected by the jury. 

46It is clear from the evidence on the voir dire of Detective Moon, the blood spatter expert who is proposed to undertake any examination, that there would indeed be an interference with the appearance of the exhibits, in particular by way of the cutting out of small portions of the shirt and the shorts so that they can be tested.

47It was submitted that I should not permit such an interference, which is significant and permanent, with exhibits that have already been tendered.

48Thirdly, it was submitted that to permit the tests to be undertaken now would have an adverse impact on the jury's assessment of the accused and the defence case. In particular it was submitted that the jury might prejudicially use the chronology of events against the accused.

Determination

49Turning to each of the grounds of resistance and focusing first upon procedural unfairness, the position of defence counsel may well have some force if it were directed towards the thongs. After all, as I have demonstrated by my chronological review, the accused did indeed, many months ago, indicate to the police that his position was that some at least of the red marks on the thongs were paint, not blood.

50However, as I have said, the Crown Prosecutor made it clear this morning that he is not pressing the application to uplift with regard to the thongs.

51As my review of the evidence and the procedural history of the trial demonstrates, at least on the material so far before me, it has never been suggested by the accused, or anyone else, that there could be paint on the shirt or shorts. The first time that that suggestion was made was during the cross-examination of Mr Sergejeff on 6 May 2013.

52I do not consider that the police should have inferred from the assertion during the forensic procedure that there could be red oxide paint on the thongs that the accused may or would also assert at the trial that there could well be red oxide paint on the shirt or the shorts.

53It follows that I respectfully reject the argument founded on procedural unfairness.

54As for the second argument, it is true that it is regrettable that there will be interference with the integrity of exhibits if the application is granted. 

55However, as I suggested in argument, I would have thought that a number of steps could be taken with the co-operation of the parties, and if necessary by order from me, to ensure that as accurate a record as possible is retained of the appearance of the exhibits as they are before they are tested. 

56Such steps could include: a detailed inspection by the jury for a second time in the courtroom of the exhibits once they are taken out of their sealed bags; the taking of photographs of the exhibits before they are tested; the creation of sketches or diagrams of the marks on them; the making of notes as to their appearance; and perhaps the creation of a video record of precisely what is done to them for the purposes of testing. And I would have thought that any expert retained by the defence team, or any member of the defence team, should, with the cooperation of the parties and subject to it having any adverse affect on the integrity of the testing, be permitted to be present in order to observe it.

57In short, in light of the steps that I consider can be taken in order to ensure that an accurate record is made of the appearance of the two items before they are tested, I respectfully reject ground 2.

58With regard to ground 3, it is conceivable that the interference with the exhibits could lead to some adverse view of the accused or the defence team on the part of the jury. It goes without saying that if and when the exhibits are tested, something would have to be said to the jury by me about the fact that the appearance of the exhibits has changed or is to change. 

59During discussion with counsel I formulated a possible direction designed to remove any such prejudice. It would be along the lines of:

""Members of the jury, you have seen that the exhibits have changed. That is because they have been tested. You may well think that the police should have undertaken that testing many months ago, but be that as it may it goes without saying that you would not hold the fact that the testing is being undertaken now against the accused to the slightest degree"".

60The Crown Prosecutor indicated that he would have no opposition to such a direction by me to the jury.

61Although there is a small possibility of the jury being perplexed or concerned by the testing being undertaken at this stage, I consider that a warning along the lines of that proposed by me would adequately deal with any such faint possibility. It follows that ground 3 of resistance to the uplifting of the exhibits is respectfully rejected.

62As I have indicated, my expectation is that the precise logistics of any testing that is to be undertaken would be with the concordance of defence counsel, in order to ensure that there can be no adverse consequence to the presentation of his case. And if agreement is unable to be reached between counsel as to precisely how any testing is to be undertaken, there would be no difficulty in any such controversy being placed before me again for my resolution.

63Finally, although I propose to allow the application of the Crown to uplift the exhibits in question, that says nothing as to the admissibility of any evidence arising from any testing undertaken by the police expert. It is clear that, at this stage, bearing in mind that one knows nothing of what the results of any such testing might be, I am incapable of making any assessment as to whether or not the test in s 55 of the Evidence Act is made out, or whether my discretion should be exercised pursuant to s 137 of the same Act, to give but two examples. I regard the question of the admissibility of any evidence obtained as a completely separate one.

Order

64In short, I make the following order: the Crown may have leave to uplift exhibits K and L.

		03 June 2013",2013-05-12 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2706772,Hammond v R [2013] NSWCCA 93,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ AT CL: I agree with Slattery J.

2SLATTERY J: The applicant was convicted in May 2012 in the Local Court of NSW at Warren of a single count under Crimes Act 1900, s 195(1)(a) of maliciously damaging the property of another, by the act of spitting on a stainless steel seat. He appealed against that conviction to the District Court sitting at Dubbo in its criminal and special jurisdiction. On 20 September 2012 his Honour Judge Lerve dismissed his appeal but, at the applicant's request, stated a case to this Court under Criminal Appeal Act 1912 s 5B. The point at issue on this case stated is whether the facts Lerve DCJ found are capable of supporting the applicant's conviction.

3The Criminal Appeal Act s5B(2) authorises the submission of a question of law ""even though the appeal proceedings during which the question arose have been disposed of"", as the proceedings had been in this case. Lerve DCJ set out the essential facts that he had found in dismissing the appeal before him in the form of a case stated. On the basis of those facts he submitted the question for this Court's determination in the following form:-
Can these facts [the facts set out in the case stated] support a finding of guilt for an offence contrary to section 195(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900, in particular was the evidence capable of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the seat had been damaged by the conduct of Dion John Hammond?

4The applicant submits that this question should be answered ""no"". And the respondent, the Director of Public Prosecutions, submits it should be answered ""yes"".

5The procedure and powers of the Court upon the District Court's submission of a question of law are prescribed under Criminal Appeal Act s 5B:

5B 
Case stated from District Court
(1) A Judge of the District Court may submit any question of law arising on any appeal to the District Court in its criminal and special jurisdiction coming before the Judge to the Court of Criminal Appeal for determination, and the Court of Criminal Appeal may make any such order or give any such direction to the District Court as it thinks fit.
(2) At the request of a person who was a party to appeal proceedings referred to in subsection (1), a question of law may be submitted under that subsection to the Court of Criminal Appeal for determination even though the appeal proceedings during which the question arose have been disposed of. The question of law must be submitted not later than 28 days after the end of the appeal proceedings, or within such longer period as the Court of Criminal Appeal may allow.
(3) The Court of Criminal Appeal may, in connection with the determination of a question of law in the circumstances referred to in subsection (2), quash any acquittal, conviction or sentence of the District Court on the appeal to the District Court.

6If the question stated by his Honour is determined in the negative, as the applicant contends it should, that determination would form the basis for an order quashing the applicant's conviction under Criminal Appeal Act s 5B(3). In the result this Court finds that the question should be answered in the negative and that his conviction should be quashed.

Crimes Act 1900 s 195 and the Case Stated
7The disposition of the point at issue in part depends upon the proper construction of Crimes Act s 195. Crimes Act s 195, which bears the heading ""Destroying or Damaging Property"" lies within Crimes Act, Part 4AD - Criminal Destruction and Damage and then within Division 2 - Crimes Against Property Generally. Some of the legislative history of Crimes Act s 195 is recounted below. The section relevantly provides:
195 Destroying or damaging property 
(1) A person who intentionally or recklessly destroys or damages property belonging to another or to that person and another is liable: 
(a) to imprisonment for 5 years, or 
(b) if the destruction or damage is caused by means of fire or explosives, to imprisonment for 10 years. 
(1A) A person who, in the company of another person or persons, intentionally or recklessly destroys or damages property belonging to another or to that person and another is liable: 
(a) to imprisonment for 6 years, or 
(b) if the destruction or damage is caused by means of fire or explosives, to imprisonment for 11 years. 
(2) A person who, during a public disorder, intentionally or recklessly destroys or damages property belonging to another or to that person and another is liable: 
(a) to imprisonment for 7 years, or 
(b) if the destruction or damage is caused by means of fire or explosives, to imprisonment for 12 years.

8The Crimes Act does not define the word ""damages"" as it is used within Crimes Act s 195(1). But Crimes Act s 194(4) gives an inclusive but not exhaustive definition for the purpose of Crimes Act Part 4AD in relation to the occurrence of damage to particular items of property known as ""unique identifiers"" (being permanent marks - such as bar codes - that distinguish the property from other similar property). Crimes Act s 194(4) provides:-
(4) For the purposes of this Part, damaging property includes removing, obliterating, defacing or altering the unique identifier of the property. The unique identifier is any numbers, letters or symbols that are marked on or attached to the property as a permanent record so as to enable the property to be distinguished from similar property.

9No such unique identifiers were said to have been damaged in this case. Although this inclusive definition provides an example of conduct that the legislation contemplates may amount to ""damage"" within s 195, its presence in the legislation throws little light on the application of s 195(1) to other forms of property.

10The applicant did not take issue with the prosecution's contention that he had acted intentionally or recklessly. Nor did he take issue with the contentions that it was his act that caused the spit to be deposited on the seat within the police dock or that the seat was ""property belonging to another"". The full facts in the case stated were:-

""In determining the appeal against conviction by Dion John Hammond on 20 September 2012 I was satisfied of the following beyond reasonable doubt:
1. Dion John Hammond was apprehended by Constable Emily May of the Warren Police at the address of 18 Wilson Street, Warren, New South Wales at about 5.20pm on 13 January 2012;
2. Upon being apprehended he was taken in policy custody to the Warren Police Station;
3. Once at the Police Station at Warren he was placed in the dock area, which is used by police to detain persons who are in police custody at the Warren Police Station;
4. At the Warren Police Station he was charged with the offences commonly or shortly known as ""Common Assault"" contrary to s 61 of the Crimes Act 1900 and ""Resist Police Officer in the Execution of Duty"" contrary to s 58 of the Crimes Act 1900;
5. While so detained at about or shortly before 7pm (time is taken from the original Court Attendance Notice, part of the Tender Bundle tendered by the Crown and marked as Exhibit A on the Appeal) projected spittle or mucus from his mouth causing it to land on the metal seat of the dock. The amount of spittle or mucus was considerable. The substance so projected is depicted in the photograph marked Exhibit ""D"" on the appeal before me;
6. The act of Dion John Hammond in so projecting that spittle or mucus was an intentional act;
7. No permanent or ongoing damage was occasioned to the dock of the Warren Police Station; and
8. Police informed Dion John Hammond that the presence of the spittle or mucus in the dock area would require professional cleaning.
Inferences drawn
I drew an inference that the dock area of the Warren Police Station had to be cleaned. I drew a further inference that such cleaning required some degree of effort by some person."" 


11With one qualification, these stated facts are a complete description of the facts necessary to resolve the contest on this appeal. Criminal Appeal Act s 5B(2) restricts the resources that appellate courts may deploy in their reasoning on a stated case. These restrictions have often been emphasised. In Collins v State Rail Authority of NSW (1986) 5 NSWLR 209, at 211, per Street CJ (Slattery CJ at CL and Yeldham J agreeing) called the procedure, ""... a cumbersome and often unsatisfactory means of bringing a matter up for consideration on appeal ... fraught with difficulties..."" The case stated must contain ""at least a statement of all the ultimate facts which in the opinion of the judge [in the court below] dictated his ultimate conclusion ... the case must state the ultimate facts including those found by inference, but not the evidence on which the ultimate facts were founded"": Industrial Equity Limited v Corporate Affairs Commissioner [1990] VR 780. Upon a case stated the Court's authority is limited to ascertaining from the contents of the case stated what are the ultimate facts and not the evidentiary facts and the Court may not have regard to matters outside the stated case: R v Rigby [1956] HCA 38; 100 CLR 146 and R v Madden (1995) 85 A Crim R 367 applying Re Van der Lubbe (1949) 49 SR (NSW) 309, at 312.

12The present stated case was generally drafted in conformity with these principles. This Court can rely upon the case as a complete statement of the District Court's ultimate findings on the appeal.

13But there is one qualification to this assumption of completeness. Both parties accepted in their respective arguments that the ""metal seat"" described in the stated case was actually comprised of stainless steel. This fact was a common feature of the parties' arguments. The facts Lerve DCJ stated certainly included a reference to the ""metal seat of the dock"". But they do not include an ultimate finding that the metal of the seat was stainless steel.

14The Court can accept the parties' consensus about that fact in their conduct of the appeal, although it makes no difference to the result. There are examples of Courts departing from this strict rule for the purpose of dealing with stated case proceedings ""within the constraints of their deficiencies""; see City of Hawthorn v Victorian Welfare Association [1970] VR 205 and Talay v R [2010] NSWCCA 308. On this minor factual issue, which does not affect the result, I will adapt to the deficiencies of this stated case by having regard, as both parties have done in their submissions, to the fact that the metal seat in question was of stainless steel.

15But on the materials before this Court there are clear limits as to what inferences are open. Exhibit D, which is the photograph of the seat, seems only to be referred to in Lerve DCJ's findings to show that the seat in question had been clearly identified. But Exhibit D itself did not become a part of the stated case. So no inference about the appearance of the seat could be drawn directly from exhibit D on the hearing of the stated case. This approach is consistent with the requirements of Rule 29 of the Criminal Appeal Rules made under the Supreme Court Act 1970. Criminal Appeal Rules r 29 provides:-

29 Submission of question of law 
Any question of law submitted to the Court for determination under sections 5A, 5B or 5BA of the Act shall be in writing and signed by the Judge. Such submission shall be sent to the Registrar together with a summary of the evidence and a statement showing the names of the parties and their legal representatives, if any.

16Exhibit D was referred to in, but was not itself a part of, the ""summary of the evidence"" in the stated case under Criminal Appeal Rules r 29.

Two Procedural Issues

17Two preliminary procedural issues arise. The applicant did not bring his application within the 28 days that Criminal Appeal Act s 5B(2) requires. The question thus arises whether leave should be granted under Criminal Appeal Act s 5B(2). The respondent also contended that the applicant had not submitted ""a question of law"" within Criminal Appeal Act s 5B(1) for this Court's determination. Both those preliminary procedural issues should be determined in the applicant's favour.

18An extension of time. The applicant's submission of the stated case was marginally out of time. It was submitted a few days beyond the time limited under Criminal Appeal Act s 5B, which requires its submissions ""not later than 28 days after the end of the appeal proceedings, or within such longer period as the Court of Criminal Appeal may allow"". The applicant's appeal was dismissed on 20 September 2012. Therefore the permitted 28 day period expired on 18 October 2012. Lerve DCJ signed the stated case on that day, 18 October 2012, and it was submitted to this Court and marked as filed on 26 October 2012, just after the 28-day period had expired. The applicant therefore needed an extension of time until 26 October 2012. 

19The applicant did not expressly make an application for extension of time. And he did not make any submissions in relation to factors favouring an extension. The respondent submitted that the leave of the Court is required for this matter to proceed. But it did not oppose the extension nor did it point to any factors to be weighed against granting the extension. The delay was very minor: a matter of only a few days. Applicants do not control the time within which judicial officers settle the final form of a stated case for submission under Criminal Appeal Act s 5B. Courts have often emphasised the need to observe the time limits set by s 5B, but usually in a context of much longer delay and where there are contests about the form of the case stated: Lavorato v Regina [2012] NSWCCA 61, at [5] - [18] and Elias v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2012] NSWCCA 302, at [10] - [17]. 

20Some flexibility should be afforded to this applicant for this very minor delay. Lerve DCJ signed the stated case on the date on which it was due to be filed. The matter is one in the Court's discretion. In my view in the circumstances it is appropriate to grant the necessary extension of time.

21A question of law. Cases stated under Criminal Appeal Act s 5B(1) must be limited to questions of law. The applicant argued that the question posed by Lerve DCJ was a question of law. The respondent disagreed.

22The test of what is a question of law for the purpose of statutory provisions such as Criminal Appeal Act s 5B(1) is well established. In Australian Gaslight Co v The Valuer-General (1940) 40 SR (NSW) 126, at 137-8 Jordan CJ stated the distinction between a question of law and a question of fact (or a mixed question of law and fact). Without the supporting authorities his Honour cited, Jordan CJ's statements of principle may be summarized in the following terms:

(1)The question what is the meaning of an ordinary English word or phrase as used in the State is one of fact not of law. This question is to be resolved by the relevant tribunal itself, by considering the word in its context with the assistance of dictionaries and other books, and not by expert evidence. Evidence is receivable as to the meaning of technical terms. And the meaning of a technical legal term is a question of law. 

(2)The question whether a particular set of facts comes within the description of such a word or phrase is one of fact.

(3)A finding of fact by a tribunal of fact cannot be disturbed if the facts inferred by the tribunal, upon which the finding is based, are capable of supporting its inferences.

(4)Such a finding can be disturbed only (a) if there is no evidence to support its inferences, or (b) if the facts inferred by it and supported by evidence are incapable of justifying the finding of fact based upon those inferences, or (c) if it has misdirected itself in law. Thus if the facts inferred by the tribunal from the evidence before it are necessarily within the description of a word or phrase in a statute or necessarily outside that description, a contrary decision is wrong in law. If, however, the facts so inferred are capable of being regarded as either within or without the description, according to the relative significance attached to them, a decision either way by a tribunal of fact cannot be disturbed by a superior Court which can determine only questions of law.

23The respondent contended that the facts inferred by the District Court ""are capable of being regarded as either within or without the description [of damage], according to the relative significance attached to them"" and accordingly this is not a decision which can be disturbed by a Court which can determine only questions of law. The respondent further submitted that this was not a case in which there is no evidence to support the determination, nor is it one in which the evidence is inconsistent with and contradictory of the determination, nor one in which the only true and reasonable conclusion contradicts the determination: see also Edwards v Bairstow [1956] AC 14, at 36. The respondent contended that the present application involved no more than deciding the meaning of an ordinary English word, ""damages"", used in a statute or deciding whether a particular set of facts comes within such a phrase, which are only questions of fact. 

24But the applicant's submissions are the more persuasive on this question. The applicant points out that the question for determination is framed to raise only a question of law: ""was the evidence capable of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the seat had been damaged?"" The applicant is only asking the Court to decide whether the facts actually inferred by the District Court are necessarily outside the meaning of ""damages"" in Crimes Act s 195(1) and therefore incapable of supporting a conviction beyond reasonable doubt. The applicant accepts all Lerve DCJ's findings of fact and contends on the basis of Jordan CJ's statement in Australian Gaslight Co v The Valuer-General (1940) 40 SR (NSW) 126, at 137-8 that the question is one of law. I agree it is a question of law. It comes within Jordan CJ's category (4): the applicant contends that facts inferred by the tribunal below from the evidence before it are necessarily outside the description of a word ""damages"" in this statute, so that a contrary decision is said to be wrong in law.

25This leads to an examination of the parties' respective contentions on the case stated.

The Parties' Submissions 

26The parties' respective submissions may be shortly stated. Both parties accepted that the Crimes Act itself did not anywhere define the verb ""damages"" within s 195, other than the limited inclusive definition in s 194(4), and that it was necessary therefore to look at the course of authority to determine the meaning of the word in this provision.

27The applicant's argument. The applicant's argument was put in two parts. The applicant first argued that mere functional interference does not form part of the meaning of ""damages"" in s 195 but that some material or physical damage is always required to make out a s 195 offence. Then, the applicant argues that findings as to what physically happened to the seat in this case could not establish material change to the seat so as to constitute s 195 ""damage"".

28(1) Material damage is necessary. The applicant first submits: that some physical alteration, derangement or interference with the physical integrity of an object is necessary for the prosecution to establish that ""damage"" to the object has occurred, or for a tribunal to conclude that a person ""damages"" it; and that mere interference with the functionality of the object is not ""damage"" within s 195(1). The applicant put his submission the following way:-
""..defacing a stainless steel chair by spittle, in circumstances where the said chair is designed for and situated within a holding cell at a police station, is not capable of establishing ""damage"", as there was no physical alternation, derangement, or interference with the physical integrity of Dock 1.""


29The applicant based his submission on certain statements of principle of Simpson J in Director of Public Prosecution v Fraser and O'Donnell [2008] NSWSC 244 (""Fraser""). In Fraser her Honour said (at [38]):
Interference with functionality alone, without ""physical derangement"" would, in my opinion, be insufficient to establish damage within the meaning of s 195 [of the Crimes Act].

30It was conceded in brief oral submissions on the applicant's behalf that if this Court decides that the decision in Fraser was wrong, then the applicant necessarily fails, because the District Court's findings included findings that there was a temporary interference with the functionality of the dock: Lerve DCJ inferred that ""the dock area of the Warren Police Station had to be cleaned"", presumably because it was unhygienic and could not be used for its proper function, until it was cleaned. For the reasons given below this concession was perhaps a little too generous when the facts found in the stated case are fully analysed.

31(2) No material damage to the seat here. The question arises next in the applicant's argument as to what material change to the seat would constitute s 195 ""damage"". The applicant concedes in submissions that his actions amounted to a defacement of the chair, in the sense that its appearance was altered. But pointing to a number of cases, which deal with defacement of objects, he argued that a conclusion that the defacement amounted to ""damage"" within the meaning of s 195 was not open on the facts here. 

32The applicant submitted that both generally and in the defacement cases authority requires consideration of two elements: the surface of the object defaced (here the chair) and the constitution of the substance defacing it (here spittle or mucus). 

33The applicant submits the chair was made of stainless steel, which ""is a non-porous, non-permeable and stain resistant surface incapable of being physically damaged by spittle"". The applicant concludes that spittle could not have bonded with the chair. It could have been easily removed without causing damage to the chair and therefore interference with the physical integrity of the chair was not demonstrated.

34The applicant concedes that Dock 1 was rendered temporarily inoperable during the period of time that it would have taken to clean it. But the applicant submits that this is a purely functional issue, something very different to suggesting a physical alteration to the chair: adapting Simpson J's words in Fraser, the applicant submits there was no damage here, merely an ""interference with functionality"". Again as these reasons later demonstrate, even this concession may be too generous upon closer analysis of the facts actually found in the stated case.

35Moreover, the applicant argues that having the dock professionally cleaned and presumably incurring the associated cost of such cleaning, instead of simply wiping away the spittle, was the choice of those administering the Warren Police Station and does not establish damage.

36Lastly the applicant submits that, for policy reasons, the facts of this case should not be classified as ""damage"" in s 195: to do so would extend the breadth of the offence and would render criminal a broad range of quite innocuous conduct. The applicant gives examples of conduct that would be criminalised were his submissions not accepted. The applicant presents the example of a person deliberately choosing to leave a dinner plate or other utensil unwashed, so that the food contents on the plate dried and hardened over time; such a plate with a hard porcelain surface could no doubt be washed without any permanent damage. But the washing of the plate would require strenuous physical labour later and would therefore qualify as s 195 ""damage"" if material damage to the surface of the object is not required.

37The respondent's argument. The respondent takes issue with both the applicant's main arguments. The respondent submits in reply: (1) that Crimes Act s 195 ""damage"" may include mere loss of functionality and that material damage is not an essential requirement; and, (2) that the physical changes to the seat here are not necessarily outside s 195 ""damage"".

38(1) Material damage is not necessary. The respondent submits that if Simpson J's decision in Fraser requires some physical injury interfering with the fabric or the integrity of the property in question, beyond interference with the function of the property, then: the decision represents an unduly restrictive narrowing of the interpretation of the word ""damage""; and it is at odds with the course of previous authority, which has developed a more flexible approach and allows Courts to consider the particular facts of each case and the property in its context when deciding what is or is not ""damage"" within Crimes Act s 195.

39(2) Physical changes here qualify as ""damage"". The respondent contends that Simpson J's analysis of the term ""damage"" in Fraser does require some physical derangement, interference or alteration of the property in question but that it need not be permanent, or even lasting. And the respondent submits: that Lerve DCJ found that placing the spittle on the chair involved such physical derangement and not an interference with functionality only, and so it was s 195 ""damage""; and, that such finding was open to his Honour on the facts before him.

40The respondent also replies to the applicant's policy based argument. The respondent says that narrowing the meaning of ""damage"", as the applicant appears to be advocating, is not appropriate. The respondent foresees that with the increasing development of modern technology new and developing forms of property might be capable of being damaged in various ways, which may not necessarily involve physical change or impact. The respondent submits that the broader interpretation of ""damage"" authorised under existing authority should be maintained.

41Summary of conclusions on these submissions. These reasons do not fully accept either the applicant's or respondent's submissions. Rather they conclude: (1) that the course of authority supports the respondent's submissions that mere interference with the functionality of an object (without material damage) may constitute s 195(1) ""damage""; (2) that it is not necessary to show that physical damage has occurred to the object to make out s 195(1) ""damage""; but (3) that facts found in the stated case do not support the conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that any material damage or functional interference was caused to the seat.

The course of authority on s 195 ""damages"" 

42The case law in relation to Crimes Act s 195(1) dates back to the early industrial revolution, when its predecessor legislation was first passed. As the Queensland Court of Criminal Appeal explained in R v Zischke (1982) Qd. R. 240 at 244E-G (""Zischke""), provisions such as the Criminal Code (Qld) s 469 (which is substantially equivalent to Crimes Act s 195 (1)) had their origins in a statute 24 and 25 Vict Chapter c. 97, known variously as the Malicious Damage Act and the Malicious Injury to Property Act which was passed in England in 1861. That enactment was itself a consolidation of a number of earlier statutes, which dealt with diverse acts of damaging fish-ponds, dams, crops, farm animals, machines or engineering works. As the Queensland Court of Criminal Appeal explained in Zischke, many of those particular provisions were designed to suppress the activities of early nineteenth century Luddites. But Section 51 of the Malicious Injury to Property Act of 1861 which became a model for the provisions of colonial legislatures (and which model, for example, ultimately found its way into Crimes Act s 195(1)) represents an attempt to formulate a general offence in respect of property of all types. Some of the early cases predate the passage of the Malicious Damage Act 1861 and are concerned with conduct in relation to machinery.

43In Zischke the Queensland Court of Criminal Appeal undertook its own comprehensive survey of these early cases, which that Court concluded demonstrated ""both the width of the expression 'damages' [used as a verb] and the variety of means available for injuring one's neighbour by acts directed against his property"". The Queensland Court of Criminal Appeal considered (at 245B - 246B) the principal 19th century authorities and some 20th century applications of them in the following way:-

Dismantling machinery was in R v. Tracey (1821) Russ. & Ry. 452; 168 E.R. 893 held to constitute a form of damage to it; as also was dislocating it: see Foster (1852) 6 Cox 25. In R v. Fisher (1865) L.R. 1 C.C.R. 7 a disaffected employee dismantled and wrongly re-assembled a boiler, plugging up a pipe forming part of it so as to render it temporarily useless and liable to burst if used. Although there was no ""actual damage"", his conviction was upheld, Pollock C.B. remarking that ""great injury may be done to a machine by the displacement of its parts"". The decision may have rested in part on the terms of the provision in question which spoke of ""damage with intent to render useless""; but Piggot B. suggested in arguendo that there was damage ""because labour was required to re-instate the machine"", and Willes J. that ""there was a lesion in the sense of a dislocation"". The decision has been followed in Northern Ireland in Getty v. Antrim County Council [1950] N.I. 114, where the plaintiff's tractor was dismantled.

Other activities resulting in convictions have included adding water to milk, which had to be thrown away: Roper v Knott [1898] 1 Q.B. 868, although the decision in that case may have been influenced by the presence of the word ""spoil"" as well as ""damage"" in s. 51 of the Act of 1861; The same may perhaps be said of the decision in R v. Maund (1866) 1 W.W. & a'B. (L) 96, where the Full Court of Victoria upheld a conviction for malicious damage arising from the scattering in the complainant's wheat field of seeds of noxious weeds (sorrell, drake and wild oats) where they germinated. Except as a conclusion of fact, it is considerably more difficult to justify the decision in Gayford v. Chauler [1898] 1 Q.B. 316 that walking across grass, described as ""knee-deep"", constituted damage. Another case which may be thought to come close to the limits is the decision of the Supreme Court of Ireland in Rexi Irish Mink Ltd. v. Dublin County Council [1972] I.R. 123 where it was held that deliberately allowing breeding mink to escape amounted to ""damage"" under the Act of 1861 because the mink, although recaptured, were thereafter no longer individually identifiable and were therefore valueless for breeding purposes. Fitzgerald J., who dissented, did so essentially on the ground that the mink were rendered less valuable ""not because of any injury to them but because of the owner's inability to identify them"" ([1972] I.R. 123, 142). The same thought underlies the [1983] 1 Qd R 240 at 246 decision of Jarvis J. in R v. Nyawo (1966) 2 S.A. 61, in the Supreme Court of what was then Rhodesia, refusing to uphold a conviction for malicious damage where the accused had pulled away the stays holding a stack of sugar cane which it had taken time and labour to compile. His Lordship considered that, although the stack was destroyed, the property to which damage had to be proved was the sugar cane and not the stack.

44Cases as early as Tracey in 1821, Foster in 1852 and Fisher in 1865 show that merely dismantling machinery so as to render it non-functional, but without there being additional evidence of physical injury, may yet amount to ""damage"" within this and equivalent legislation. As these reasons will show, later cases have often applied this reasoning. 

45Developments in technology in the 20th century led to the application of malicious damage legislation to new materials and new kinds of machine. For example in King v Lees (1948) 65 TLR 21 a divisional court held that a person who urinated on the mat of a taxi cab had injured the cab even though the injury could be put right ""quickly and easily leaving no after-effect"". Even daubing paint on statues, thereby disfiguring them, but in such a manner that they can be restored, although only with expense and difficulty, was nevertheless held to amount to damage within equivalent legislation: R v Bowden (1957) (3) SA 148 (applying the English law offence of malicious damage to property received into the Roman-Dutch law of South Africa).

46But in the last three decades of the 20th century developments in the relevant case law accelerated. Many of the cases in this later period arose out of acts of political protest or the causing of harm to computers. The first Australian example in this period is Samuels v Stubbs (1972) 4 SASR 200 (""Samuels v Stubbs""), a case in which the defendant was charged ""with having wilfully and without lawful authority destroyed or damaged a cap, the property of a police officer, contrary to s 43 of the Police Offences Act (SA) 1953 - 1972."" The police officer's cap had fallen to the ground whilst he was attempting an arrest during an anti-war demonstration. The defendant had kicked the cap and then jumped on it with both feet. The cap was crushed but not recovered. Another person had removed it from the scene. In Samuels v Stubbs Walters J, sitting on appeal from a dismissal of the charge, emphasized the difficulty of laying down any general rule about what may constitute damage and pointed out that the meaning of the word ""damages"" must be controlled by its context. In the relevant context his Honour considered that damage might be proved by a ""temporary functional derangement"" of the particular property, namely the cap. This is what he said (at 203):-

The word ""damage"" in law has more than one meaning, and care has to be exercised in examining the context in which the word appears (cf. Swansea Corporation v Harpur [1912] 13 KB 493, per Fletcher-Moulton LJ at p 505). It seems to me that it is difficult to lay down any very general and, at the same time, precise and absolute rule as to what constitutes ""damage"". One must be guided in a great degree by the circumstances of each case, the nature of the article, and the mode in which it is affected or treated. Moreover, the meaning of the word ""damage"" must, as I have already said, be controlled by its context. The word may be used in the sense of ""mischief done to property"", as distinct ""from injury done to the person"", so that the term ""damage"" may not necessarily ""be employed interchangeably with the term 'injury' with reference to mischief wrongfully occasioned to the person"" (cf. Smith v Brown (1871) LR 6 QB 729). It is my view, however, the word ""damages"", as it is used in s 43, is sufficiently wide in its meaning to embrace injury, mischief or harm done to property, and that in order to constitute ""damage"", it is unnecessary to establish such definite or actual damage as renders the property useless, or prevents it from serving its normal function - in this case, prevents the cap from being worn. 

In my opinion, it is sufficient proof of damage if the evidence proves a temporary functional derangement of the particular article of property. I think that an offence is committed against the section if there be wilful and unauthorised injury, mischief or harm to property, even though no loss to the owner of the property ensues; that a distinction may be drawn between damage to property and the consequent loss or damage to the owner of it. (cf. Roper v Knott *1872) lr 4 pc 184, AT P 191 PER Lord Russell CJ at p 872).

47Walters J found that the constable's cap was damaged in that it was ""injured or harmed in such a way to cause temporary derangement of its function and of the purpose which it was normally to serve"". His Honour concluded that the defendant should be convicted. His Honour's description, ""functional derangement"", has been subsequently used as a formula for testing whether damage has occurred due to loss of function or usefulness.

48In 1978 further judicial exegesis of the expression ""damages property"" in this and equivalent legislation first appeared. In that year an English Crown Court in ""A"" (a Juvenile) v The Queen [1978] Crim L Rev 689 (""A"" (a Juvenile)"" formulated and applied a test of whether a person ""damages property"", which test has since been considered with approval and applied at appellate level in Australia. 

49The case in question, ""A"" (a Juvenile), is not only a source of subsequent Australian authority, but it also bears a close factual resemblance to the present case. The defendant had spat once on a police sergeant's raincoat. The sergeant was unaware of the incident occurring but attempted to remove it later with a paper tissue. The defendant was arrested and charged and as a result no further attempts were made to clean the raincoat. At the hearing, when the uncleaned raincoat was produced, a faint mark could be seen on it. The prosecution contended that the raincoat required dry cleaning and must therefore have been ""damaged"". The defence contended that there was no case to answer because the prosecution failed to prove any damage. The defendant was convicted and appealed. The Crown Court in allowing the appeal said the following:-

that when interpreting the word ""damage"", the court must consider the use of an ordinary English word. Spitting at a garment could be an act capable of causing damage. However, one must consider the specific garment which has been allegedly damaged. If someone spat upon a wedding satin dress, for example, any attempt to remove the spittle may in itself leave a mark or stain. The court will find no difficulty in saying that an article had been rendered ""imperfect"" if, after a reasonable attempt at cleaning it, a stain remained. An article may also have been rendered ""inoperative"" if, as a result of what happened it has been taken to dry-cleaners. 

However, in the present case, no attempt has been made, even with soap and water, to clean the raincoat, which was a service raincoat designed to withstand elements. Consequently, there was no likelihood that if wiped with a damp cloth, the first obvious remedy, there would be any trace or mark remaining on the raincoat requiring further cleaning. Furthermore, the raincoat was not rendered ""inoperative"" at the time; if it was ""inoperative"", it was solely on account of being kept as an exhibit. 

Thus, in the view of the court, nothing occurred which could properly be described as damage. 

50The appellant's conviction in ""A"" (a Juvenile) was quashed. But the case introduced a new judicial approach to analysis of the various equivalents of Crimes Act s 195, an approach, which Courts have sometimes found to be of practical assistance. It may not be a test that will readily suit every case. In my view it is an approach that is useful for the present case. The ""A"" (a Juvenile) test requires the Court to look at the specific property in question and consider: (i) whether its physical appearance changed as a result of the act, despite reasonable attempts at cleaning, so that it may be described as ""imperfect""; or (ii) whether as a result of the act the property was rendered ""inoperative"", or unable to be used for its ordinary functions for a period whilst its imperfections were eliminated. If the property can be described as either ""imperfect"" or ""inoperative"" in these senses, then the property has been ""damaged"" within the meaning of Crimes Act s 195 and cognate legislation in relation to malicious damage to property.

51Four years later, in 1982 the Queensland Court of Criminal Appeal (Campbell CJ, and Matthews and McPherson JJ) applied ""A"" (a Juvenile) in Zischke. The appellant in Zischke had been convicted on 11 counts of wilful damage to property by painting political slogans on the surface of buildings, footpaths and walls in public places. The Queensland Court of Criminal Appeal considered the authorities already referred to and applied a test of ""damage"" that was directly based on that formulated in ""A"" (a Juvenile), namely whether the act rendered the object ""imperfect or inoperative"". The Court decided that the reasoning in Samuels v Stubbs could also readily be accommodated within the ""A"" (a Juvenile) formula:

What emerges from a review of the decisions is that ""damage"" may be held to have been done even though the injury to the article of property is not permanent but is remediable, if only by the expenditure of money. Probably the formula that most nearly embraces all the attempts at definition is that a thing is damaged if it is rendered imperfect or inoperative: see ""A"" (a Juvenile) v. The Queen [1978] Crim. L. Rev. 689. This would incidentally also serve to accommodate the decision in Samuels v. Stubbs (1972) 4 S.A.S.R. 200, where a conviction of damaging a policeman's cap was sustained by proof that the respondent had kicked it three times and then jumped on it, thus producing what was described as a ""temporary functional derangement"" of the article in question.

In the present case what was done is fairly capable of being described as rendering imperfect the objects to which the paint was applied. It was not in our view essential to the success of the prosecution to establish that an expenditure of money was required to remedy the state of affairs produced by the paint, although proof of such expenditure may afford helpful evidence of the fact and extent of the imperfection created. This being so, His Honour's direction on this point correctly and properly left it to the jury to determine as a fact whether or not, by applying the paint, the accused had damaged the property to which it was applied.

52On this basis, in Zischke the Court upheld the defendant's conviction; there being evidence of expense and effort expended by or on behalf of property owners to obliterate the painted words from the surfaces on which they appeared.
53Two years later, in 1984 another judicial formula for the establishing of malicious ""damage"" emerged. In R v Henderson & Battley Court of Appeal (Crim Div) (Unrep 29/11/84) (""Henderson & Battley"") involved the dumping of soil, rubble and mud onto a development site. The persons who dumped that material were convicted of damaging the land and the Court of Appeal upheld their conviction. It was found in Henderson & Battley that a significant sum of money had to be spent to remove the rubbish and to restore the land to its pre-existing condition. Cantley J's approach to whether or not damages had occurred was based on the concise Oxford Dictionary definition of ""damage"" as ""injury impairing value or usefulness"" (the Macquarie Dictionary definition is similar). His Honour said on this subject:

Ultimately whether damage was done to this land was a question of fact and degree for the jury. Damage can be of various kinds. In the Concise Oxford Dictionary 'damage' is defined as 'injury impairing value or usefulness'. That is a definition which would fit in very well with doing something to a cleaned building site which at any rate for the time being impairs its usefulness as such. In addition, as it necessitates work and the expenditure of a large sum of money to restore it to its former state, it reduces its present value as a building site ...""

54The Court of Appeal had held that the usefulness of the site had been temporarily impaired and upheld the defendant's conviction. Whether or not physical damage had occurred to the site was not considered in Henderson & Battley. But by 1990 it was to become clearer on the English authorities that malicious damage may be constituted either by physical material change to the property or by impairment of value or usefulness.

55But the formula in Samuels v Stubbs was still widely applied. In Hardman & Ors v The Chief Constable of Avon and Somerset Constabulary (1986) Crim. L Rev. 330 the Crown Court considered the appeal of a number of defendants who were convicted of causing criminal damage to a pavement during a nuclear disarmament demonstration. They had painted an unstable whitewash on the pavement which was expected to wash away with rain over time. But the local authority had decided to clean the pavement using high pressure water jets. The appellants contended there had been no damage to the pavement. ""A"" (a Juvenile) was cited to the Crown Court but it considered an ""unduly narrow definition of damage"" was not appropriate and took direction from the words of Walters J in Samuels v Stubbs that ""one must be guided in a great degree by the circumstances of each case, the nature of the article and the mode in which it is affected or treated"". The Court found that there had been damage in the sense of ""mischief to property"", citing Samuels v Stubbs, which had caused expense and inconvenience to the local authority.

56In Morphitis v Salmon (1990) Crim Law Reports 48 the Queens Bench Division (Lloyd LJ and Auld J) quashed the appellant's conviction by magistrates under Criminal Damage Act 1971 (UK) s 1(1) for damage to a scaffolding clip and bar erected as part of a barrier over a common access way. Auld J, in a judgment in which Lloyd LJ agreed, restated that determining whether damage done in any particular case is a matter of ""fact and degree"". After citing Cantley J in Henderson & Battley, his Honour said:

Whether the damage ... was caused in any particular case was a question of fact and degree and could be of various kinds ... It included not only permanent or temporary physical harm but also permanent or temporary impairment of value or usefulness. 

57Again Auld J continued and made clear that physical harm and impairment of usefulness were alternative ways of establishing malicious damage: 
The authorities show that the term ""damage"" for the purpose of this provision, should be widely interpreted so as to include not only permanent or temporary physical harm, but also permanent or temporary impairment of value or usefulness.

58The charge in Morphitis v Salmon was only in respect of damage to the scaffold bar and clip, not the larger barrier of which it was a part. The distinction between the two became important on the appeal because the magistrates had found there was no actual physical damage to the bar and clip that could be attributed to the appellant. There was no doubt that the usefulness of the barrier as a whole had been impaired by the removal of the individual bar and clip. But because the charge related only to the bar and clip the question was whether their removal had impaired their usefulness. The case demonstrates the importance of analysis of the use and function of the precise property the subject of the charge, when impaired usefulness is in question. Auld J said: 

Even if the scratches had been capable of being attributed to the appellant, it is apparent from the case stated and the findings of the magistrates, that there was no evidence before them upon which they could have found that it constituted damage in the sense of impairment of value or usefulness on what were, after all, scaffolding components. The scratching of a scaffolding bar is an ordinary incident of its existence and it is unlikely that the magistrates, if they had considered the matter, would have been entitled to find that it constituted damage in the sense that I have described. 

The main question for this court is whether the dismantling of the barrier constituted damage to the bar and to the clip in the wide sense of impairment in their value or usefulness as part of the barrier. 

Many of the reported cases concern allegations of criminal damage to an article by reason only of the removal of some part of it although no physical damage was caused to the article in question or to the part removed. In such case, where the owner is left, albeit temporarily, with an incomplete article which does not fully serve the purpose that it did before the removal of the part, there has clearly been damage to the article as a whole. Thus, in R v Tacey (1821) Russ & Ry 452, there was held to be damage to a stocking frame where a part was removed from it rendering it inoperative. In R v Fisher (1865) 29 JP 804; (1865) LR 1 CCR 7, the mere tampering with a machine so that it would not work was held to be damaged although no part of it was removed or broken. And in Getty v Antrim County Council (1950) NIR 114, the dismantling of a plough without damage to any of the dismantled parts, was held to be damage to the plough. 

A more up-to-date example of criminal damage is Cox v Riley (1986) 83 Cr App R 54. In that case, the Court of Appeal upheld a conviction where the appellant had deliberately erased a computer programme from a plastic circuit card of a computerized sort so as to render it inoperable. 

However, the matter is different, as in this case, if the charge is one of criminal damage to the part removed from some other object and not to the larger object itself and where there is no physical damage to the part removed. See eg R v Woodcock [1977] Crim LR 104 and 161.

59The case is also instructive because it illustrates the need to have regard to matters of fact and degree: the scratches to the scaffolding, though constituting material alterations to the surface of the bar were nevertheless consistent with its ordinary use. Moreover the case indicates against the overly rigid formulation of requirements for physical harm to property or impairment of its value or usefulness.

60In R v Whiteley (1991) 93 CR App R 25 the Court of Appeal considered an appeal of a computer hacker against his conviction under the Criminal Damage Act (UK) 1971, legislation which is in similar terms to Crimes Act s 195(1). No physical damage had been caused to the discs of the computer by the hacker's conduct, which had involved rewriting the information on the discs. But the result of the hacker's actions was that the computer's programs did not work as intended and time and effort had to be spent in replacing them. After reviewing the authorities including Henderson v Battley, Morphitis and Salmon and the computer damage case Cox v Riley (1986) 83 Cr. App R.54 , Lord Chief Justice Lane held [at 29]:
Morphitis v Salmon [1990] Crim.L.R. 48 was another decision of the Divisional Court. The facts of the case are immaterial, but in the course of delivering his judgment, but in the course of delivering his judgment, with which Lloyd L.J. agreed, Auld J, in the transcript of the judgment, having cited the decision in Cox v Riley (1983) 83 Cr.App.R. 54 said this:

""The authorities show that the term 'damage' for the purpose of this provision, should be widely interpreted so as to include not only permanent or temporary physical harm, but also permanent or temporary impairment of value or usefulness.""

The effect of those various decisions, in our judgment, is as follows: Any alteration to the physical nature of the property concerned may amount to damage within the meaning of the section. Whether it does so or not will depend upon the effect that the alteration has had upon the legitimate operator (who for convenience may be referred to as the owner). If the hacker's actions do not go beyond, for example, mere tinkering with an otherwise ""empty"" disc, no damage would be established. Where, on the other hand, the interference with the disc amounts to an impairment of the value or usefulness of the disc to the owner, then the necessary damage is established.

61In the result the Court of Appeal dismissed the appellant's appeal against conviction. In my view by 1991 English authority was clear that malicious damage could be occasioned either by physical harm, or by impairment of value or usefulness.

62But Australian authority was also advancing. In R v Hayne, Court of Criminal Appeal (18 September 1998) CCA 60496/97 - unreported (""Hayne""), this Court (Handley JA and Levine and James JJ) said it ""had no reason to doubt the correctness"" of Samuels v Stubbs. In Hayne this Court was considering an appeal against conviction for manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act, namely the act of pouring petrol throughout a house, which then accidentally ignited, causing the death of an occupant. On the issue of whether that act was unlawful, this Court applied Samuel v Stubbs, Hardman v Chief Constable of Avon, and Morphitis v Salmon. But the Court does not seem to have been referred to Zischke or ""A"" (a Juvenile). The Court held that whether the pouring of petrol be described as a Samuel v Stubbs ""temporary functional derangement"" or a Morphitis v Salmon ""temporary impairment of value or usefulness"", the act of pouring the petrol qualified as malicious damage to property under Crimes Act s 195 and was therefore ""unlawful"". 

63This Court in Hayne did not have to choose between the formulae in Samuels v Stubbs and Morphitis v Salmon (nor consider Zischke) to reach this result. This is not surprising. As Walters J explained in Samuel v Stubbs ""it is difficult to lay down any very general and, at the same time, precise and absolute rule as to what constitutes 'damage'"". And as Lloyd LJ and Auld explained in Morphitis v Salmon ""whether damage...was caused in any particular case was a question of fact and degree and could be of various kinds"". The courts' approach to what constitutes ""damage"" will vary from case to case. But the judicially developed formulae of past cases do assist in determining whether damage has been caused in any particular case. But sometimes particular formulae will be more useful for analysis of the facts. Looking ahead at the facts of this case, involving as it does fluid on the surface of a seat, the approach taken in ""A"" (a Juvenile) seems particularly apt. But as will be seen, all the different judicial formulae would in my view produce the same result in this case.

64Finally, the course of authority is completed with two cases decided in the last decade; one in England in 2005 and the other in this Court in 2008. In R v Fiak (2005) EWC Crim 2381 (""Fiak"") the appellant had been arrested for being drunk in charge of a car and assaulting a police officer. He was convicted before a jury of criminal damage under the Criminal Damage Act (UK) s 1(1) and appealed. After being placed in a police cell overnight he had put a blanket down the toilet and repeatedly flushed it, flooding his cell. The appellant's argument that clean water on a waterproof floor could not constitute 'damage' was unsuccessful. Judge LJ and Rafferty and Hallett JJ applied the principles cited above from Morphitis v Salmon and Whiteley, that damage may include not only permanent or temporary physical harm but also permanent or temporary impairment of value or usefulness. Their Honours found that the blanket could not be used as a blanket until it had been dried and that the cell was out of action until the water was cleared. Their Honours also held it was open to the jury to conclude that the blanket and cell had been damaged within Criminal Damage Act s (1)(1) (UK) and the appeal against conviction was dismissed.

65The last decision in this survey of authority is DPP v Fraser and O'Donnell (2008) NSWSC 244 (""Fraser""). The appellant placed emphasis on this case in his submissions. In Fraser Simpson J was considering a DPP appeal against the dismissal of charges under Crimes Act s 195 against members of an environmental protest group, who put a coal conveyor belt out of operation for almost 2 hours. The members of the group had accessed the coal loader premises, activated a safety isolation switch, which rendered the conveyor belt inoperable and then chained themselves and locking devices to part of the conveyor belt structure. The defendants did not physically alter the conveyor belt, which could be de-isolated by resetting electrical equipment. The question was whether the protestors had occasioned ""damage"" within s 195(1) to the coal loader, despite the lack of a finding of physical harm. The appellant in Fraser argued on the basis of Walters J's statement in Samuels v Stubbs, ""In my opinion it is sufficient proof of damage if the evidence proves a temporary functional derangement of the particular article of property"" that mere functional interference to the conveyor belt was sufficient to constitute damage.

66Her Honour concluded that no damage within the meaning of s 195 had occurred, because the conveyor belt was not itself physically affected by the action of the defendants. After extensive review of the authorities, including a civil case Ranicar v Frigmobile Pty Limited [1983] Tas R 113, together with Henderson v Battley, Hardman, Samuels v Stubbs and Zischke her Honour concluded (at [38]) that physical harm was necessary before 'damage' could be established:
In my opinion, an essential element of ""damage"" for the purpose of s 195 is, to use the words (or some of them) of Walters J in Samuels v Stubbs, ""physical derangement"" (though not necessarily permanent, or even lasting) to the property in question. It is the word ""functional"" that has given rise to the present argument. But I do not read his Honour's conclusion as meaning that temporary functional interference, without a physical interference with the property itself, could be sufficient to establish criminal damage. It is of some significance that in that case the evidence was that the policeman's cap had been jumped upon and crushed. That was ample evidence of physical derangement. In my opinion too much emphasis has been placed upon the word ""functional"" without it being seen in its complete and proper context. Interference with functionality alone, without ""physical derangement"" would, in my opinion, be insufficient to establish damage within the meaning of s 195. Interference with functionality could be proved, for example, by proof of the removal of a key to a motor vehicle, or the erection of physical barricades around a vehicle preventing its use. But here, in my opinion, while they might amount to some other offence, such interference would fall short of amounting to (malicious) damage. 

67In the context of a substance such as spittle/mucus being placed on property (as is the case here), the applicant here submitted that her Honour's statements in Fraser in relation to a ""physical derangement"" or ""physical interference"" to the property meant that it was necessary for the prosecution now to establish that that the substance and the property in question had to ""bond"". He submits that if the analysis in Fraser is correct, and such physical interference is a necessary element of ""damages"" and if no such bonding can be established on the facts, no relevant damage could have occurred here. In answer the respondent submits that ""physical derangement"" may be satisfied by a substance being deposited on the property, without any ""bonding"" taking place.

68But it is not strictly necessary to decide this question in these reasons because of the approach taken below in relation to the findings in the stated case: that the findings neither establish physical damage nor functional interference with the seat. 

69But were it necessary to decide the question I would respectfully differ from the approach that Simpson J took in Fraser, and conclude that the course of authority in both England and Australia now supports the conclusion that interference with functionality of the property in question alone, even without physical harm to or ""derangement"" of the property is sufficient to establish ""damage"" within Crimes Act s 195. In my opinion this conclusion is justified on the various judicial formulae of what constitutes ""damage"" developed in the course of authority. Both Zischke and ""A"" (a Juvenile) allow physical harm (""imperfect"") and functional interference (""inoperative"") as alternative paths to establishing a finding of criminal damage. Samuels v Stubbs also approved in this court in Hayne allow that ""temporary functional derangement"" is alone a sufficient basis for a finding of criminal damage. And Morphitis v Salmon, Henderson & Battley and Whiteley allow the establishing of ""physical harm"" and ""impairment of value or usefulness"" as separate paths to a finding of criminal damage.

Consideration

70Whichever of these judicial approaches is taken to the facts found in the present case, those facts do not support the applicant's conviction. Whether the approach in Zischke and ""A"" (a Juvenile) is deployed to assess whether a person ""damages"" a thing within Crimes Act s 195(1) by being rendered imperfect or inoperative, or whether the approach in Samuels v Stubbs of ""functional derangement"" is adopted, or whether the approach in Morphitis v Salmon of ""physical harm"" or ""impairment to value or usefulness"" is adopted, the result in my view is the same. The facts found in this stated case do not support the applicant's conviction.

71This conclusion readily emerges from a close reading of the facts found in the stated case in light of authorities discussed above. Upon analysis Lerve DCJ found neither physical damage to the seat nor actual interference with the usefulness of the seat.

72As to physical damage, either permanent or temporary, the case stated is clear ""No permanent or ongoing damage was occasioned to the dock of the Warren Police Station"". But, of course, it is not necessary for the damage in question to be permanent or irreparable: Zischke at 246 and Fraser at [27].

73Nor did Lerve DCJ make any finding of temporary physical damage to the seat. His Honour did not make findings about the effect of the spittle/mucus interacting with or adhering fast to the surface of the stainless steel. This is perhaps not surprising given the anti-corrosive characteristics of stainless steel. This is not like the graffiti cases, which often include findings about material such as paint being applied to a surface then adhering to that surface, and only being able to be removed by specific methods such as a high-pressure hose, or over time, by the force of rain on other agents. Either no evidence was put before Lerve DCJ as to such adherence or as to specific removal requirements; or if there was such evidence, his Honour was not prepared to make any relevant findings based upon it, other than through his reference to ""professional cleaning"", a reference which has the limitations analysed below. The facts his Honour found are quite consistent with the physical effect of the spittle/mucus on the metal seat being such the same as many fluids, which could be wiped away with a damp cloth without leaving any mark.

74Nor did Lerve DCJ find any interference with the function of the seat in the dock. All he found was that the applicant ""projected spittle or mucus from his mouth"" and that he thereby caused it ""to land on the metal seat of the dock"". The only findings that could support an inference of interference with function were that ""police informed [the applicant] that the presence of the spittle or mucus in the dock area would require professional cleaning"". But his Honour recognised the unsatisfactory nature of this hearsay statement from the police about ""professional cleaning"". He did not infer as a matter of objective fact that professional cleaning would actually be required. His Honour was only prepared on the evidence before him to draw the rather more limited inferences that the dock area ""had to be cleaned"" and that ""such cleaning required some degree of effort by some person"" (emphasis added). These findings are quite consistent with an employee at the police station merely wiping a damp cloth over the seat to clear it of spittle/mucus in the course of otherwise required routine cleaning, or in the course of what described in Re ""A"" (A Juvenile) as ""a reasonable attempt at cleaning"". His Honour did not infer a need for professional cleaning, or a need for the expenditure of any specific funds on such cleaning, or any particular level of difficulty or additional effort or inconvenience beyond what would be required for the removal of this substance during routine cleaning of the area. 

75Whilst it is true on the authorities discussed it is not necessary to prove the expenditure of funds to establish damage on a Crimes Act s 195 charge, such expenditure is nevertheless one indicator that damage has occurred: Samuels v Stubbs, at 203. 

76But none of these findings amount to an ultimate finding of an interference with the function of the seat in the dock. Far more detailed preliminary findings would be required to support an ultimate finding of functional impact from the spittle/mucus. Such a finding could well require the answers to many questions. How long was the seat? (As explained earlier in these reasons, Exhibit D, the photograph of the seat, was not submitted as part of the facts found.) How much of the seat was covered by the spittle/mucus? Did the portion of the seat covered by spittle/mucus make the whole seat temporarily unusable, or not? Considering the importance of analysis of the relevant function of the property in question (see Morphitis v Salmon above), given the frequency of persons being charged in Warren Police Station at the time could the spittle/mucus have been removed with a simple cleaning cloth before it was required for the next person charged? Was the dock/seat in fact used after the applicant was present in it? Would the spittle/mucus probably have been removed in any event as part of the routine cleaning system for the dock area due to its regular use by members of the public: a cleaning system which must ordinarily anticipate that some of the dock's users may be intoxicated, may have influenza or may have recent wounds. Without the answers to those and other questions it is not open to draw an inference beyond reasonable doubt that this substance did interfere with the seat's function. These questions are neither asked nor answered in the findings before this Court on this case stated. And importantly here there was no clear finding that the seat or the dock could not serve its function for any identifiable period.

77Questions such as these illustrate that the element that a ""person damages"" property in this Crimes Act s 195(1) charge requires the proof of facts that establish either physical harm to or functional interference with the property the subject of the charge, so as to show that the thing was rendered imperfect or inoperative in the context in which the property exists. Such supporting proof is not evident in the findings here. This observation should not be taken as any criticism of Lerve DCJ: it seems apparent that the necessary factual material was not before him. 

78Thus the Court is left with findings that do not support an inference of physical damage or functional interference to the seat or showing that the thing was rendered imperfect or inoperative. The applicant's conviction therefore cannot be supported on those findings and must be quashed. 

Conclusion and Orders

79In the result therefore the orders I would propose that the Court make are:
(1)Extend time up to and including 26 October 2012 for the applicant to submit his stated case; 
(2)The question of law on this stated case should be answered in the negative, as the facts set out in the case cannot support a finding of the applicant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt of an offence contrary to Crimes Act s 195 (1)(a) by damaging the seat in question; and,
(3)The applicant's conviction is quashed pursuant to Criminal Appeal Act 1912 s 5B.

80BELLEW J: I agree with Slattery J.

2706774,R v Rodney Pitt [2013] NSWSC 548,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: Rodney Pitt pleads not guilty to the charge that he did murder Leslie James Pitt on 24 December 2011 at Walgett in the State of New South Wales. The plea of not guilty is entered on the basis that the accused was mentally ill at the time. Leslie James Pitt, the deceased, was the father of the accused.

2The Crown bears the onus of proof of establishing beyond reasonable doubt: 

(i) that it was a deliberate act or acts of the accused that caused the death of Leslie James Pitt; and 

(ii) the deliberate act or acts causing death were done with the intention to kill. 

3As the sole issue is the question of mental illness, the trial has proceeded by the way of the tender of witness statements, Dr Cala's autopsy reports, the DNA analysis and the reports of the psychiatrists (ex A). 

4I will refer to some of the witness statements as succinctly as possible. At about 4:45pm on Saturday 24 December 2011 Detective Senior Constable Singh and Inspector Ralph were informed by the Castlereagh LAC Aboriginal and Cultural Liaison Officer, Isaac Gordon, who for the sake of convenience I will refer to as ""Isaac"", about his concerns about the accused. 

5Isaac advised that one of his relatives, Leslie, was having problems with his son, Rodney, who had been suffering from schizophrenia. He said that
Leslie had contacted him recently voicing concerns about Rodney's health and his belief that Rodney had gone off his medication. Detective Senior Constable Singh informed Isaac that the police would have to conduct an assessment and based on that Rodney could either be taken to the hospital under a schedule or voluntarily go to the hospital of his own accord. Isaac said that Leslie did not want police to take Rodney from home but that he was going to talk to Leslie about it a bit more. Detective Senior Constable Singh suggested that Isaac speak to Leslie to find out if he wanted police assistance in which case an assessment of Rodney would be undertaken.

6At about 6:06pm Mr Bert Gordon, conveniently referred to as ""Bert"", Isaac's brother, received a phone call from Leslie saying, ""Help, I've been stabbed"". Bert drove to Leslie's house, followed by an ambulance. Bert was accompanied by a number of people and contacted Leslie's grandson, Edward Pitt, who also attended the premises. 

7Bert stated, in his statement signed 24 December 2011, that he saw the accused come out of another bedroom on the opposite side of the lounge room and he had his hand clenched like he had a knife up his arm. 

8Edward Pitt, in his statement signed 26 December 2012, stated that having entered Leslie's house, he found Leslie covered in blood and with a large cut to the back of his head. He stated that Leslie did not say what had happened to him. 

9The police subsequently found a white-handled boning knife under Leslie's bed that was covered in blood. Leslie was taken to Walgett Hospital and treated for stab wounds to his head and upper torso. He was pronounced dead by Dr Mohammad Sharier at 9:41pm. 

10The accused was arrested shortly after the incident. At the time of his arrest, Detective Senior Constable Singh observed that he was suffering from large wounds to the insides of his hands. Dr Sharier examined the accused in his police cell at 10:30pm and stated that the accused was agitated and not communicating with anyone. Dr Sharier scheduled the accused for involuntary admission. 

11The autopsy report reveals that the deceased had died from multiple stab wounds. The only rational inference from all of the evidence is that the accused stabbed his father multiple times with a white-handled boning knife. 

12Ms Yehia SC does not submit the stabbing was not voluntary, that is, not willed by the accused. 

13I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused deliberately stabbed his father multiple times, thereby causing his death, and he did so with the intention to kill. 

14I turn to the sole question for consideration, which is whether the accused at the time of the stabbing was mentally ill so as not to be responsible according to law. 

15The onus of proof of establishing mental illness is on the accused on the balance of probabilities. The Crown does not contend that the accused has failed to discharge the onus of establishing mental illness. To establish that the accused was mentally ill so as not to be responsible according to law for his actions, the accused must show that as a result of a defect of reason from a disease of the mind he did not appreciate the nature and quality of the physical act of stabbing his father or did not know that it was wrong. 

16What then is meant by a disease of the mind which produces such a defect of reason? The law requires that the accused's state of mind must have been one of disease, disorder or disturbance arising from some condition which may be temporary or longstanding, whether curable or incurable. A defect of reason, memory or understanding involves a disorder of the capacity to reason such as one that prevented the accused from knowing what he was doing, in that he did not know the physical nature or quality of the act or did not know that the act was wrong but wrong according to the ordinary standards of reasonable people in our community.

17As to whether the accused did not know the act of stabbing his father was wrong, the question I ask myself is whether the accused could be said to know, in the sense of appreciating or understanding, that his acts of stabbing his father were wrong if, through a disease or disorder of the mind, the accused could not think rationally of the reasons which to ordinary people would make that act right or wrong. 

18Dr Bruce Westmore, a psychiatrist, examined the accused on 14 September 2012. In a report dated 17 September 2012 Dr Westmore reports that the accused told him that he had been hearing voices and seeing ghostly figures for about two months. As to the events on the day of the stabbing the accused's recount of events to Dr Westmore, included hearing strange voices that were getting bad, and he did not remember grabbing a knife. He said that he knocked on his father's door, that his father opened the door and saw that he had a knife. The accused told Dr Westmore that he heard voices as he got into the room telling him to ""do it, do it"". He said that he had the knife raised up in the air. His father sort of fell in shock and said, ""Don't, Rodney."" The accused said that all of a sudden he heard the voices saying, ""Do it, do it."" He lowered the knife and hit his father with the knife in the shoulder. The accused said that he did not remember stabbing his father after the first blow. The accused explained to Dr Westmore that he thought his father had molested his kids or himself when he was young; that was what the voices were telling him. 

19The accused told Dr Westmore he first heard voices in about 1995 when he was about 16 or 17. He said that he was getting messages from Hillary Clinton when he would see her on television. 

20The accused first saw a mental health worker when he was aged 16 or 17. He was hospitalised in 2005, and there had been two admissions to Bloomfield with the last admission occurring in 2007 or 2008. The accused said that he had been prescribed Zyprexa on two separate occasions in the past but he last took medication about three to four weeks before the stabbing. 

21Dr Westmore's diagnosis included chronic paranoid schizophrenia. Dr Westmore opined, page 6:

""[The accused] was acutely mentally ill at the time. He was suffering from a disease of the mind (chronic paranoid schizophrenia). This illness would have totally compromised his ability to understand his actions in relation to his father were wrong, both in a moral and legal sense. His mental illness would have prevented him to consider his actions with a moderate degree of calmness and rational thought. I believe he was delusionally driven and he could raise the defence of mental illness.""

22In his evidence this afternoon, Dr Westmore confirmed the opinions that he expressed in the report. 

23Dr Lisa Brown, a psychiatrist, interviewed the accused at the request of the Crown on 29 January 2013. In a report dated 31 January 2013, Dr Brown carefully reviewed the accused's prior mental history and considered the accused had developed schizophrenia in around 2006. She considered that it was likely that in the period leading up to 24 December 2011 both the accused's substance abuse and psychotic symptoms remained active in association with a lack of compliance with antipsychotic treatment. She considered that the various sources of the information that she reviewed were consistent with the accused having suffered from an acute form of psychosis as part of an underlying diagnosis of schizophrenia at the time of the events occurring on 24 December 2011. 

24There is no disagreement in the opinions expressed by the psychiatrists. Dr Brown writes at page 17:

""Similar to the opinion provided by Dr Westmore it has been considered likely that [the accused's] capacity to consider his actions and their consequences, both from a moral and legal point of view, were impaired by his psychotic illness, even taking into account possible contributions from antisocial personality features and intercurrent substance abuse...""

25In her oral evidence, Dr Brown confirmed her agreement with the opinions expressed by Dr Westmore. 

26The opinions of the psychiatrists are supported by the accused's longstanding mental illness, the evidence from Isaac Gordon as to the difficulties the accused had with his mental health over the years and the accused's strange behaviour on the afternoon of 24 December 2011 prior to the stabbing. 

27One of the matters mentioned by Mr Gordon was that when he saw the accused at Dewhurst Street the accused went to the front fence, raised his head to the sky and howled like an animal or a werewolf. Mr Gordon sought to persuade the accused to go to hospital but was unsuccessful. 

28Shortly after the accused was arrested, he was assessed by Dr Sharier. The accused was agitated, non-communicating and seemed to be responding to auditory hallucinations. Dr Sharier scheduled the accused under the Mental Health Act for involuntary admission as his behaviour was not safe for himself or others. Justice Health records reveal features consistent with a psychotic illness, including inappropriate smiling, restricted, guarded and blunted moves and thought blocking, all of which Dr Brown considered were characteristic features of schizophrenia. 

29I accept the opinions of Dr Westmore and Dr Brown. The accused has satisfied me on the balance of probabilities that at the time he stabbed his father he was suffering from chronic paranoid schizophrenia, a disease of the mind. As a consequence of the paranoid schizophrenia, he could not consider his actions with a moderate degree of calmness and rational thought. I find that the accused did not know at the time of the stabbing that what he was doing was wrong. 

30I find the accused not guilty of murder by reason of mental illness. 

31Pursuant to s 39 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, I order that the accused be detained in the forensic hospital at the Long Bay Correctional Centre until released by due process of law.

		14 May 2013",2013-05-12 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2706780,R v MacLeod [2013] NSWCCA 108,"Judgment

1SIMPSON J: In September 2012 the respondent was charged on indictment in the District Court in Sydney with a single of count of making a collusive agreement with a member of the NSW Police Force for the purpose of improperly taking advantage of the member's position. He entered a plea of not guilty. After a trial, the jury returned a verdict of guilty. On sentence, the respondent asked that a further nine offences (of possession of restricted substances, contrary to s 16(1) of the Poisons and Therapeutic Substances Act 1966) identified on a Form 1 be taken into account pursuant to Pt 3 Div 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Procedure Act""). By s 200(2)(b) of the Police Act 1990, the collusive agreement offence is subject to a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 7 years and/or a fine of 200 penalty units. 

2On 14 November 2012 Phegan ADCJ sentenced the respondent to imprisonment for 9 months. Pursuant to s 12 of the Sentencing Procedure Act, his Honour suspended execution of the whole of the sentence.

3Pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 the Director of Public Prosecutions (""the DPP"") appeals against the asserted leniency of the sentence. The particular complaint made is directed, not to the length of the sentence imposed, but to the order for its suspension.

4The charge on the indictment was brought under s 200(2)(b) of the Police Act, which is in the following terms:

""(2) A person (including a member of the NSW Police Force) who: 
(a) gives, or offers or promises to give, any bribe (pecuniary or otherwise) or any other benefit to a member of the NSW Police Force, or
(b) makes any collusive agreement with a member of the NSW Police Force,
for the purpose of inducing the member to neglect his or her duty, of influencing the member in the exercise of his or her functions or of improperly taking advantage of the member's position is guilty of an offence.

The facts

5Because the respondent's conviction resulted from a contested trial, there was no agreed statement of facts. The facts relevant for sentencing purposes were found by the sentencing judge on the basis of the evidence in the trial. In that regard, his Honour was conscious that, while it was his responsibility to find the facts, it was necessary that those facts be not inconsistent with the jury verdict. There was one, in particular, disputed issue of fact for sentencing purposes, to which it will be necessary to return.

6The offence the subject of the indictment was committed between 3 May 2011 and 2 June 2011. The respondent was a businessman in the Coffs Harbour area, in the north of NSW. He owned and operated two furniture stores in that city, and operated a gymnasium, of which he was part owner, on the Gold Coast. In Coffs Harbour he was and is responsible for the employment of 12 staff. The respondent was a longstanding close friend of a local detective, Detective Senior Constable Anthony Farrell, who was assigned to the Joint Investigation Response Team. Farrell was the member of the Police Force with whom the respondent made the collusive agreement.

7A good deal of the evidence in the trial consisted of recordings of intercepted telephone conversations between the respondent and Farrell; there was also evidence of telephone conversations between the respondent and other individuals. Transcripts were available for the jury.

8The evidence established that, for some time, dating as far back as 2001, the respondent had been under suspicion by local police with respect to dealing in performance enhancing drugs and ecstasy.

9On 5 May 2011 a telephone conversation took place between Farrell and the respondent concerning the use of performance enhancing substances, during which the respondent appears to have expressed some concern about his own position, saying that he felt like ""crawling into a hole"". Farrell is recorded in the transcript as replying:

""Oh it's not worth standing in a hole mate. I'll always give you heads up if I see that you're under notice because I get all the intel reports and stuff.""

To this the respondent replied:

""Yeah.""

10This conversation, the sentencing judge held, was the conversation in which the collusive agreement the subject of the charge on the indictment was made. He held that its proper construction was that Farrell was offering (against police rules) to access information of a confidential nature and the respondent was accepting the offer. In other words, it was at this point that the respondent made the collusive agreement with Farrell. The judge held that, at this time, the respondent was well aware that he was accepting an offer by Farrell to act in breach of his professional obligations (both by accessing confidential information, and disclosing that information to the respondent). He held that the agreement was directed at averting any police investigation that might ultimately have had some adverse impact on the respondent, and enabling him to evade the consequences of the investigation.

11On 24 May 2011, while he was driving north from Coffs Harbour, the respondent was stopped by police and his vehicle searched. It was made clear to the respondent that his name was contained in the NSW Police database system (""COPS"") as a suspected supplier of steroids, and that the purpose of the search of the vehicle was to investigate whether he was in possession of such substances. (No such substance was in fact located in that search.)

12Immediately after the search, the respondent telephoned Farrell, and told him of being stopped and his vehicle searched. There followed a discussion about whether the information (""intel"") that prompted the search came from NSW or Queensland sources; Farrell then said:

""Ahh shit 'cause I um, I looked you up the other day and there's no, no dramas at all. I might have to look a little bit harder but I won't talk on the phone about it but buddy.""

13The construction placed on this conversation by the sentencing judge was that the respondent telephoned Farrell to protest that, contrary to the agreement they had made, Farrell had failed to warn him of the police intention to intercept him and search his vehicle, and that Farrell, recognising that he had failed to comply with his agreement, undertook to be more thorough in the future. A little later on the same day, Farrell sent the respondent a text message, requesting that the respondent provide his driver's licence number, and shortly thereafter Farrell accessed the COPS system, using the licence number the respondent had provided. Farrell accessed seven intelligence reports relating to the respondent.

14The evidence disclosed that thereafter Farrell did in fact access the COPS system on a number of occasions. It also disclosed a significant number of occasions on which Farrell and the respondent communicated, by text messages and telephone. A number of these occasions coincided with the times at which Farrell accessed the COPS system. The Crown relied upon this timing as the basis for an inference that Farrell was indeed passing on the information he obtained to the respondent. 

15On 29 May 2011 the respondent was recorded in a telephone conversation with another person, Cheyne Rogan. During the course of that conversation, with reference to a third person, the respondent said:

""I know you're good mates with him but it's probably a good idea to distance from him at the moment ... he's as hot as a hot potato, mate ... I kind of have a very good hunch on it.""

It was the Crown's contention, which the sentencing judge neither expressly accepted nor rejected, that this remark indicated that the respondent had in fact received information concerning the third person from Farrell - and that that explained his ""very good hunch"".

16On 1 June 2011 a search warrant was executed at the respondent's home. That search yielded the restricted substances that were the subject of the Form 1 offences. The respondent pointed to the results of this search as evidence that Farrell had not passed on information to the respondent.

17Farrell was charged with the common law offence of misconduct in public office. On the day fixed for trial (3 September 2010) he entered a plea of guilty, and asked that a number of additional offences (two of unauthorised access to restricted data - Crimes Act s 308(1); three of disclosure of personal information by a public official - Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998; two of possession of restricted substance) be taken into account.

18On 13 February 2013, after taking into account the somewhat belated plea of guilty, Phegan ADCJ sentenced him to imprisonment for 2 years, with a non-parole period of 1 year. Had it not been for the plea of guilty, the sentence would have been 2 years and 6 months.

The respondent's personal circumstances

19The respondent did not give evidence either in the trial, or on sentence. A considerable amount of personal information was put before the sentencing judge by way of a pre-sentence report prepared by an officer of the Probation and Parole Service, a psychological report, and a considerable volume of references and testimonials.

20The respondent was born in March 1971, and was therefore 40 years of age at the time of the offence. He had no prior criminal history. He was in a stable marriage, with two children aged (at sentencing) 6 years and 3 years. As mentioned above, he successfully operated furniture businesses, which produced adequate income. The authors of many of the testimonials spoke highly of his work ethic and commitment. 

21To the author of the pre-sentence report, the respondent claimed that the restricted substances located at his home on 1 June came into his possession by a variety of means - some had been left at his residence by visiting friends and relatives, some belonged to his wife, others were prescription medicines which he had tended to hoard. His wife gave a similar account.

22The author of the report expressed considerable scepticism, noting:

""Mr MacLeod's explanations for the substances was found wanting. Important questions remained unanswered regarding the provenance and purpose of the items.""

23The author of the report also recorded that the respondent had explained the conversation of 5 May as ""just a joke"".

24The psychological report to which I have referred was prepared by Dr Jacqui Yoxall. She recorded a similar personal history, including information provided to her by the respondent that Farrell was ""one of his closest friends"". She recorded that the respondent had explained to her also that the conversation of 5 May was nothing more than a joke between friends. She recorded that the respondent was aware of the potential of a sentence of full-time custody, and that he told her that that would have a devastating financial impact on his businesses, his staff and his family, and that his wife would be unable to manage the businesses in his absence; she said that he asked rhetorically, even if his wife took on the responsibility for the businesses:

""Who would look after our children?""

She recorded that the respondent told her that, if the businesses were lost, the costs of restarting would be prohibitive.

25At this point it can be noted that following receipt of Dr Yoxall's report, the respondent emailed her with some corrections to factual matters in the report. Of present interest is the following:

""Substances taken from home was more than just Viagra. A total of 13 items were seized, of which 10 were eliminated by either doctors script, physician dispensed (not requiring a script) or expired medication (most expired over 6 years ago). There are only 3 items of which I may be called upon to answer to. Literally nothing in quantity."" 

26Among the testimonials and references tendered was one from the respondent's wife, attesting to the history of their relationship and the businesses. She described the respondent as ""the heart and soul and the driving force"" of the businesses. Also included in that bundle was a letter from Ms M Jenkins, the accountant to the business. After describing in very positive terms the respondent's attention to and involvement in the businesses, Ms Jenkins referred to a recent period in which the respondent had become involved in another business on the Gold Coast which deflected his attention from the Coffs Harbour stores with the result that the Coffs Harbour stores suffered. She said that since he had removed himself from the Gold Coast business the Coffs Harbour stores had been performing better and were ""getting back on track"".

27She said:

""It does concern me that should Andrew be unable to manage the business on a daily basis that its financial performance will suffer. Those relying on their jobs and the financial support of this business will suffer. The local Coffs Harbour business community will also suffer if there is another struggling business. Additionally, the value and reputation of the business will also suffer.""



The proceedings on sentence

28The sentencing hearing took place on 13 November 2012. As mentioned, the respondent did not give evidence, and no oral evidence was called on his behalf. Counsel who appeared for him both at sentence and on appeal relied upon the documentary material placed before the sentencing judge. He pointed out that the origin of the collusive agreement lay in the offer by Farrell, unprovoked and unsolicited by the respondent. 

29He made other detailed submissions, of which the following ought be noted. He made particular reference to Dr Yoxall's report, concerning the respondent's involvement in the businesses, and their viability being dependent upon his involvement. He also referred to the statement by Ms Jenkins, particularly the paragraph extracted above.

30His Honour then said:

""Just so that I don't have any doubt about the adverse impact on both personal and if I can use a broad term, commercial that a sentence of imprisonment would have on a large number of people, that is convincingly argued in a number of the documents. The difficulty is for me is how heavily that consideration weighs in the overall determination of the sentence because generally that's not a matter of central importance in all of the issues that have to be weighed, I don't know whether the Crown would choose to say anything about that particular issue or not but it is well it's not for example a matter that is listed as a consideration under the relevant legislation, it is under the Commonwealth Act I should note, but not under the State Act and that tends to have led the court to - courts in this State to take the view that it's not a matter of central importance, but Ms Crown you're looking --""

31The Crown replied:

""No I accept that it's a matter of mitigation and your Honour could well take that into account but eventually the Crown would say the serious nature of the offence and the absence of exceptional subjective circumstances the only appropriate sentence would be imprisonment.""

32There was then further discussion with counsel for the respondent, who submitted, inter alia, that there was no evidence that the respondent was making use of any information provided by Farrell. Ultimately, counsel submitted that a non-custodial sentence would be open, and that if his Honour considered that the offence warranted something more serious than that, then a period of imprisonment wholly suspended would ""suffice to cover all of the matters"" before the sentencing judge. His Honour invited the Crown representative to comment upon that, to which she replied succinctly:

""Your Honour would be falling into appellable error.""

The Remarks on Sentence

33I have already referred to some of the factual findings made by the sentencing judge. The respondent does not dispute that the collusive agreement was made in the telephone call of 5 May; nor that the collusive agreement involved Farrell agreeing to access confidential police records, and disclose that information to the respondent; nor that Farrell did in fact have that access. What was in dispute in the proceedings was whether, and if so, to what extent, Farrell disclosed the results of that access to the respondent. This was the disputed issue of fact which I mentioned in [5] above. The sentencing judge dealt with this in his Remarks on a number of occasions. At an early stage, he said:

""It was part of the Crown case, and continues to be part of the Crown case on sentence, that it can be fairly assumed that the uninterrupted conversation was one in which Farrell, having access to COPS records - and I will come back to those in some more detail later - had passed on at least some of the information which was contained in those records. But that remains a matter of conjecture, I underline, but it certainly has been something which has been raised in both contexts by the Crown and which may take on some importance for reasons I will come back to later.""



Later he said:

""There is no evidence in this case of any actual benefit from the supply of information. I say that with the necessary reservation, and I will have something more to say about this in due course, that a great deal of what I will call the peripheral evidence in this case is very inconclusive. Whether Farrell ever did pass on the information to the offender which he had belatedly obtained from the COPS entries remains a matter of conjecture.

We know from the evidence, and this was one of a number of admitted facts, that Farrell accessed these entries, and he therefore had the entries available to him, and he could have passed them on, but there was no direct evidence of that ever happening.""

34With reference to the conversation with Cheyne Rogan, in which the respondent had claimed to have had ""a very good hunch"", the sentencing judge said:

""Again it is a matter of inference, and I make no further comment on that, but again can I say that that warning does not indicate that the offender was getting any benefit out of even that information that appears to have been passed on from Mr Farrell. It was intended, if anything, for the benefit of Mr Rogan rather than for anyone else.""

Finally, his Honour said:

""The Crown's position was essentially this, that the offender, on the basis of all of the evidence available on sentence, was, at the time of the offence, and had been for some years, engaged in the possession and sale not only of restricted substances, including steroids, but probably illicit drugs. That the items found and seized during a search of his house and garage were symptomatic of a much more substantial involvement in the import, possession and sale of illicit substances. The offence in this case, the Crown therefore argued, should be assessed in that broader context.""

35Later, his Honour dealt with the substances found at the respondent's home as a consequence of the execution of the search warrant. He expressed considerable scepticism about the explanation given by the respondent to Dr Yoxall concerning these substances. He noted that the respondent's assertion that only three items called for explanation was inconsistent with the nine charges on the Form 1.

36With respect to the respondent's personal circumstances, the sentencing judge quoted at some length from Dr Yoxall's report, and referred to the various letters and testimonials. He accepted the respondent as a person of prior good character. 

37Nevertheless, in the light of what was contained in the pre-sentence report, he found that there was no remorse exhibited by the respondent, and held that that rendered a satisfactory conclusion with respect to potential re-offending impossible. 

38He held that the offence fell at the lower end of the scale of objective seriousness, and that in those circumstances an appropriate sentence would be of imprisonment for 9 months. 

39He then turned his attention to the matter that has been the focus of the Crown appeal - the suspension of the sentence, which he said caused him more difficulty than any other matter he had to consider. He referred again to the sentiments expressed in the testimonials, but observed that the person portrayed in those testimonials was nevertheless guilty of a serious criminal offence. He said:

""That is, I have to say sadly, not unusual, a respectable member of the community engaged in criminal activity, and this is clearly an example. My concern, however, when it comes to a sentence of imprisonment, is not the offender. The offender in my judgment deserves to go to gaol and I have no reservations about that.

However, sending him to prison will, on the testimonials which I accept, cause very significant hardship, not just to the immediate members of his family, to his wife and two children; that is inevitable, but he is a businessman, self employed, with a number of employees. His businesses, according to the testimonials, will suffer considerably and will be at risk if they are deprived of his involvement. I am therefore mindful of the impact on quite a large number of people if this man is imprisoned.

It is that factor which causes me to consider very carefully whether the sentence should be suspended, and I have given this matter very careful consideration, particularly in view of the position which the Crown quite properly has taken. I have concluded only with very considerable difficulty because of the impact which imprisonment will have on a number of others, totally undeserving and with no involvement in the commission of this offence, that a suspension of the sentence is appropriate."" (italics added)

40He accordingly made the order under s 12 of the Sentencing Procedure Act suspending execution of the sentence.

The Crown appeal

41The Crown has pleaded four grounds of appeal, as follows:

""Ground 1: His Honour was in error in finding that hardship to third parties justified the suspension of the sentence.

Ground 2: It was not reasonably open to his Honour to find that Farrell did not pass on any information from COPS entries to the respondent.

Ground 3: His Honour was in error in suspending the sentence.

Ground 4: The sentence is manifestly inadequate.""

Ground 1:] suspension of sentence
Ground 3:]

42It is clear from the extracts from the Remarks on Sentence above that his Honour (correctly) considered that the respondent's offence called for a sentence of imprisonment. It is equally clear that the sole reason for ordering that execution of the sentence be suspended was the hardship to others, particularly employees of the businesses operated by the respondent.

43The Crown referred to a long line of authority to the effect that it is only in exceptional circumstances that hardship to third parties can be taken into account in order to reduce an otherwise appropriate sentence: R v Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 510. The Crown also illustrated that proposition by reference to a series of cases following Edwards in which hardship has been rejected as a basis for reduction in sentence: see Hay v R [2013] NSWCCA 22; Ihemeje v R [2012] NSWCCA 269; Bangaru v R [2012] NSWCCA 204; FP v R [2012] NSWCCA 182; Flick v R [2012] NSWCCA 170; McCraw v R [2011] NSWCCA 162; Sinkovich v R [2011] NSWCCA 90; R v Kertebani [2010] NSWCCA 221; King v R [2010] NSWCCA 202; Dipangkear v R [2010] NSWCCA 156; Waugh v R [2010] NSWCCA 3; Elmir v R [2009] NSWCCA 22; Hopley v R [2008] NSWCCA 105.

44It is to be noted that virtually every case (Edwards excepted) in which the subject of exceptional hardship to third parties has been considered as a possible basis for reduction in sentence has involved hardship to family members. That is not this case. Although his Honour recognised and accepted that the hardship that would follow the incarceration of the respondent would affect his wife and children, he properly recognised that that is a common consequence of the incarceration of an offender. It was, as I have said above, the impact on employees and the businesses that motivated his Honour to make the order that he did.

45Although this Court was referred to no other case in which it has been suggested that the effect on employees could be allowed to affect the sentence to be imposed, such a prospect was recognised by Gleeson CJ in Edwards. His Honour said:

""There is nothing unusual about a situation in which the sentencing of an offender to a term of imprisonment would impose hardship upon some other person. Indeed ... it may be taken that sending a person to prison will more often than not cause hardship, sometimes serious hardship, and sometimes extreme hardship, to another person. It requires no imagination to understand why this is so. Sentencing judges and magistrates are routinely obliged, in the course of their duties, to sentence offenders who may be breadwinners of families, carers, paid or unpaid, of the disabled, parents of children, protectors of persons who are weak or vulnerable, employers upon whom workers depend for their livelihood, and many others, in a variety of circumstances bound to result in hardship to third parties if such an offender is sentenced to a term of full-time imprisonment."" (italics added)

46Tellingly, the Crown submitted, the sentencing judge not only made no reference to these authorities, but he gave no indication that he had the principle in mind.

47The Crown in the sentencing proceedings left no doubt that its position was that anything less than the imposition of a full-time custodial sentence would constitute appellable error. Unfortunately, the Crown did not explicitly state the principle, nor did she refer to any authority. The nearest she came to stating the principle was in her reference to ""the absence of exceptional subjective circumstances"" in her response to the sentencing judge.

48That she did not make any such express reference is perhaps understandable, given that the principle is well established and well known and that it might not have been apparent in advance of the hearing (and even in the very late stages of the hearing), that such an order (for suspension) would be proposed on behalf of the respondent.

49Counsel for the respondent referred to a passage in the judgment of Whealy J in Dipangkear, in which his Honour summarised the principles relevant to the question here under consideration. His Honour said:

""The present situation of the law, relevant to the present appeal, may be briefly stated as follows:-

(a) Where all the features of the particular case point to the need to impose a custodial sentence but there is evidence of extreme hardship, a court may take into account the extraordinary features of the case in any one of three ways. It may suspend the sentence of imprisonment. Alternatively, the sentence may be shortened, or the non-parole period decreased.

(b) Each case will, to a very great degree, depend upon its own facts involving an evaluation of the seriousness of the objective circumstances of the offence committed, the extent of the requirement for general and, perhaps, specific deterrence, and the nature and degree of the impact of the sentence upon the third person."" (italics added)

50It is to be observed that the summary in Dipangkear of what steps are open to a court proceeds on the premise that ""extreme"" hardship, or ""extraordinary features of the case"" have been found. That is not this case.

51Counsel for the respondent pointed only to the reference to ""very significant hardship"" in the remarks at the point where the sentencing judge was dealing with the possibility of suspending the sentence as indicating that he had the principle in mind.

52I am satisfied that that does not amount to an adequate consideration of the principle stated in Edwards and subsequent cases, and does not amount to a finding that circumstances were exceptional within the principle stated. It could not have done so; the evidence was far from adequate to establish exceptional circumstances.

53At the time the Crown appeal was heard, although the sentencing outcome in respect of Farrell was known, the judge's Remarks on Sentence were not available. They have since been released, and counsel for the respondent provided them with additional submissions in writing. The import of the additional submissions was that the judge was at some pains in those Remarks (post dating the sentencing of the respondent) to recognise the exceptional nature of the suspension of a sentence where the offending calls for full-time imprisonment. He also emphasised, as he had when sentencing the respondent, that the only reason for suspending the sentence was the potential effect on the employees of the respondent's businesses.

54These additional remarks do nothing to change the view I had already formed, and have expressed above. First, a subsequently stated explanation for a sentence ought not ordinarily be taken into account. Second, a finding of exceptional circumstances was necessary in order to justify the suspension of what would otherwise be a sentence of imprisonment to be served in custody. There is no recognition of the need for a finding of exceptional circumstances on the Edwards principle. Third, the circumstances he took into account were not capable of amounting to exceptional circumstances within the Edwards principle. 

55In my opinion Grounds 1 and 3 must succeed. The evidence of hardship to third parties was not such as to entitle the judge to convert what he recognised ought to have been a sentence of full-time custody into one which was suspended.

Ground 2: information passed by Farrell to respondent 

56The precise terms in which Ground 2 are pleaded are set out above. It is predicated upon the factual premise that his Honour found (as a fact) that Farrell did not pass on any information from COPS entries to the respondent.

57In my opinion, the ground as pleaded is misconceived. His Honour made no such finding. As is plain from the extracts I have set out above, his Honour was urged by the Crown to find that Farrell had indeed disclosed to the respondent relevant information. In making those submissions, the Crown relied upon significant items of evidence, most of which, being recordings of intercepted telephone conversations, were not (and could not have been) the subject of challenge. These included the exchange between Farrell and the respondent on 24 May, in which Farrell asked the respondent to provide his driver's licence number (which the respondent did) following which Farrell accessed the COPS system, and a number of intelligence reports. Another was the telephone conversation between the respondent and Cheyne Rogan, in which the respondent warned Rogan not to associate with a third party, and referred to his ""very good hunch"". 

58It is true that from these an inference, and a strong one, was available that the respondent was in possession of information provided to him by Farrell. Indeed, it would be very difficult to sustain an affirmative finding of fact that Farrell had not disclosed information to the respondent. However, his Honour did not make that finding of fact; he referred to the proposition of the Crown as ""conjecture"". Although he did not say so in terms, the only reasonable interpretation of his findings in this respect is that he was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Farrell had made the disclosures to the respondent. 

59That makes the ground very difficult to sustain. In effect, the Crown would have to establish that it was not open to the sentencing judge not to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the disclosures had been made; put another way, that the evidence of disclosure was so overwhelming that no conclusion other than that disclosure had been made was open.

60While I find the judge's failure to be so satisfied a little puzzling, I do not think it can be categorised as an error in the necessary sense.

61I would reject Ground 2.

Ground 4: manifest inadequacy

62As argued, this ground depends entirely upon the suspension of the sentence. Senior counsel who appeared for the Crown accepted that he could not realistically seek an increase in the term of the 9 month sentence imposed. That concession has much to do with the sentence subsequently imposed upon Farrell, and principles of parity. In my opinion, that concession is overly generous.

63For my part, I could easily be persuaded that a sentence of 9 months imprisonment is manifestly inadequate to meet the criminality involved in this offence. However, since the Crown has not sought an increase in that sentence, and the respondent has accordingly not been heard in that respect, I would not propose an increase in the sentence. In addition, as this offence is one which is (fortunately) not frequently seen in the courts, there is a dearth of judicial authority on appropriate sentencing. For those reasons, I would accept the Crown concession, to the effect that this Court should re-sentence the respondent by re-imposing the sentence of 9 months' imprisonment, but deleting the order for suspension. Moreover, senior counsel for the Crown fairly accepted that it would be appropriate to specify a non-parole period applicable to the 9 months sentence.

64I wish to make it perfectly plain that the sentence I propose ought not to be taken as a benchmark for sentencing in respect of offences against s 200 of the Police Act. Such offences are serious, and threaten the integrity of the administration of justice. They potentially may pose danger to police sources of information, and jeopardise important investigations. My acceptance of the sentence of 9 months is based solely on the position adopted by the Crown, and that, to increase that sentence at this stage, would involve this Court in a denial of procedural fairness.

65I therefore propose the following orders:

(i) Crown appeal allowed;

(ii) The sentence imposed on the respondent be quashed;

(iii) In lieu thereof the respondent be sentenced to imprisonment for 9 months, commencing on 13 May 2013 and expiring on 12 February 2014, with a non-parole period of 6 months and 3 weeks expiring on 3 December 2013.

(iv) Direct that the respondent be released at the expiration of the non-parole period.

66HARRISON J: I agree with Simpson J.

67BELLEW J: I agree with Simpson J.

		13 May 2013",2013-05-12 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2706781,R v Ahola (No 5) [2013] NSWSC 702,"EX TEMPORE Judgment

1Yesterday I delivered a judgment permitting the Crown to uplift two exhibits in circumstances in which the Crown had made clear that what was proposed was that those exhibits would be tested by a police officer expert, in short, in matters to do with blood. 

2That application was resisted on three bases by defence counsel. Today, the Crown Prosecutor has informed me from the Bar table that the result of that testing is that four places on the shirt taken from the accused on 19 October 2011, exhibit K, and four places on the shorts taken from the accused on the same date, exhibit L, returned a positive result for blood. One of the locations on the shirt was, it seems, somewhat delayed in that result. 

3A separate question has been discussed today as to whether or not those results should be admitted in the trial. Reference should be made to my judgment of yesterday, 13 May 2013, in which I provided a detailed chronology not only of events in the trial but also procedural events pertaining to the trial, and I shall not repeat that conspectus in this judgment. 

4Three grounds of resistance were identified by defence counsel with regard to the argument yesterday. The first was a procedural unfairness in the Crown being able to undertake those steps at this stage of the trial. The second was an interference with the integrity of the exhibits already in the custody of the Court and inspected by the jury. The third was a prejudice that could arise with regard to the jury perhaps approaching the fact of testing being done at this stage of the trial adversely to the accused. 

5Mr Scragg has explained to me today that ground two, the integrity of the exhibits, is not relied upon at this secondary stage. With regard to ground three, prejudice to the accused, in light of a direction that I propose to give the jury with the concurrence that the Crown expressed yesterday, he does not identify any prejudice above and beyond the procedural unfairness that I have called ground one. 

6In short defence counsel maintains the position that he made forensic decisions in the conduct of the trial, including but not limited to his cross-examination of the Crown witness, Mr Sergejeff, founded upon the Crown case as it then stood. It would be unfair for the Crown to be permitted, as it were at this stage, to rebut the propositions that unpinned the cross-examination of Mr Sergejeff, after that cross-examination had occurred and those forensic decisions had been made by defence counsel. 

7For the reasons I identified in my judgment yesterday, I would have thought that that argument would have a deal of force if it had been directed towards subsequent testing of the thongs, exhibit M, and evidence of that subsequent testing. That is because, as I demonstrated in my judgment yesterday, it is the case that during the forensic procedure that took place on 19 October 2011 the accused did indeed inform the police that his position was that some of the red material on the thongs was paint. However, the whole of that question can be put to one side because, as things resolved yesterday, the Crown did not press the application to uplift exhibit M, the thongs, and those items have not been tested. 

8As I demonstrated in my chronological review yesterday, it was never identified as an issue in the trial by the accused or his legal representatives whether or not it was blood or paint or a combination of both on the shirt, exhibit K, or the shorts, exhibit L, up until the date upon which Mr Sergejeff was cross-examined by defence counsel, namely 6 May 2013. 

9Accordingly, for the reasons I gave yesterday I am not persuaded that there would be any procedural unfairness in those circumstances in the Crown tendering the evidence at this stage. It follows as well that I did not discern any prejudice to the accused arising from the adoption of that procedure. 

10Finally, subject to anything that the parties wish to say to me at the end of this judgment, I propose to provide a brief comment to the jury along the lines foreshadowed by me yesterday with regard to the testing of the items at this stage. 

11In short, I respectfully reject the submissions of defence counsel. My ruling is that the evidence of the subsequent testing of exhibit K, the shirt, and exhibit L, the shorts, will be admitted in the trial.

		03 June 2013",2013-05-13 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2706785,R v Ahola (No 6) [2013] NSWSC 703,"EX TEMPORE Judgment

1Application has been made by defence counsel for the discharge of the jury. It is founded on the fact that the fingerprint expert, Detective Leading Senior Constable Buffett, said something inappropriate in his evidence-in-chief. The transcript of an extract of his evidence was tendered by defence counsel in support of the application, and became defence exhibit D on the voir dire. The salient portions of that transcript are as follows. At page 7 line 4 the following appears:

""Q. All right now, what did you have to compare those fingerprints that were developed with? [I interpolate to say that the learned Crown Prosecutor at that stage was referring to the crime scene fingerprints.] 

""A. At which particular time?

Q. From whom they were placed on those items?

A. The comparison that I made for the purposes of, according to this certificate, I've always done where possible off ones taken at the time of arrest. 

Q. Right?

A. But other comparisons are performed but it might be prejudicial if I go into that.

Q. No, no, no, just ones that were taken from the time of arrest of Mr Ahola we're talking about?

A. Yes.""

2A little later in evidence-in-chief the following exchange occurred commencing at page 8, line 27 of the transcript:

""Q. Okay, continue on?

A. 'On Monday 5 December 2011 I retrieved from the digital image management system images bearing forensic case numbers 1534791, 154392 and 1515308. I also retrieved from the National Automated Fingerprint Identifications System a set of fingerprint impressions in the name of Jouni Risto Ahola which are shown to have been taken on Wednesday 19 October 2011 under charge number H46052312'.

Q. And that's the date of Mr Ahola's arrest in relation to this particular matter?

A. I believe so, yes.""

3The submission is that the jury would inevitably infer from the first extract that the accused is a person with a criminal record whose fingerprints were held by the New South Wales Police, prior to them being taken from him with regard to this matter. It is that inference that forms the foundation for the application of the discharge of the whole jury. 

4A number of aspects of the giving of the evidence by the witness are noteworthy. 

5The first is that the evidence was not heard by defence counsel, and it was only when I invited to his attention it having been given that it became a cause of concern. 

6The second thing is that the witness, at least to my hearing, was not speaking particularly loudly or forcefully. If anything, his mode of giving evidence was somewhat to the contrary. 

7The third thing is that the Crown Prosecutor intervened to a degree to deflect the witness from saying what he was saying, and I refer in particular to the extract that commences at page 7 line 16 of the exhibit, though it is true that defence counsel submits respectfully that in fact that intervention made matters worse. 

8The fourth thing is that it seems to me from the words used that they could be interpreted as speaking, at least in part, in generalities rather than with regard to this particular matter. I refer in particular to the reference at page 7 line 13 as follows, ""But other comparisons are performed"", and the flavour of the extract as a whole. But, again, Mr Scragg has submitted that reference to ""it might be prejudicial"" must surely be a reference to this particular matter. 

Submissions

9The submissions of defence counsel can be summarised as follows. First, as I have indicated, he submits that the logical interpretation and inference of what the witness was saying could only reasonably be that the fingerprints of the accused were held by the New South Wales Police as a result of him having a criminal record prior to 19 October 2011. Secondly, he submitted that I should proceed on the assumption that at least one juror heard what was said. Thirdly, it was submitted, as I indicated a moment ago, that the steps taken by the Crown Prosecutor, far from being ameliorative, in fact could well have made the matter worse. Fourthly, it was submitted that no direction or other step taken by me short of discharging the whole jury could solve the problem.

10The submissions of the Crown Prosecutor were as follows. He opposed the discharge of the whole jury, although with customary fairness he accepted that what occurred was certainly a matter of concern. He recorded that it was his impression that the witness was speaking in generalities, although he conceded that the reference to prejudicial matters is certainly suggestive that the witness was talking of this particular trial. Finally, he submitted that a direction that I formulated before lunch for the purpose of discussion with counsel would have the effect of solving the problem without, in short, making it worse.

Review of authorities

11I turn to my determination. It is appropriate first for me to review some of the authorities with regard to the question under consideration. The leading case is the decision of the High Court of Australia in Crofts v The Queen [1996] HCA 22; (1996) 186 CLR 427. It is said, and accepted by defence counsel, that the test for the discharge of a jury in a criminal trial requires a ""high degree of necessity"". That proposition is founded on the decision in Crofts v The Queen at 432 of the reported judgment.

12It was said in the joint judgment of Toohey, Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ at 440:

""No rigid rule can be adopted to govern decisions on an application to discharge a jury for an inadvertent and potentially prejudicial event that occurs during a trial. The possibilities of slips occurring are inescapable. Much depends upon the seriousness of the occurrence in the context of the contested issues; the stage at which the mishap occurs; the deliberateness of the conduct; and the likely effectiveness of a judicial direction designed to overcome its apprehended impact.""

13In Williams v The Queen [2000] FCA 1868; 119 A Crim R 490, a decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia sitting as a the Court of Criminal Appeal of the Australian Capitol Territory, the accused was on trial for armed robbery. A juror came to know that the accused had previously been convicted of the very same offence. The juror was examined and gave evidence that that information had not been conveyed to any other member of the jury. The trial judge discharged the individual juror but rejected an application to discharge the whole jury. It was quite possible that in the circumstances other jurors had heard similar remarks (see 496 of the reported decision). In the circumstances of that case, the Full Court of the Federal Court held that it had been an error for the trial judge not to discharge the whole jury. 

14In R v Bartle [2003] NSWCCA 329; (2003) 181 FLR 1, the accused was on trial for importing a commercial quantity of cocaine. A co-accused in evidence engaged in an outburst that revealed that the accused had a criminal record and had been in gaol. An application to discharge the jury in those circumstances was refused. The Court of Criminal Appeal (Mason P and Barr J; Smart AJ dissenting) did not interfere with the trial judge's exercise of discretion not to discharge the jury. 

15In Qing An v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 53, the accused stood trial on eight counts of armed robbery. A jacket seized from the home of the accused was tendered in evidence and as an exhibit went to the jury room. There was evidence that both the accused and his brother wore that jacket. Regrettably it seems that the jacket was not checked before it went to the jury room, and it turned out that the jacket had a syringe in it. A discharge application in those circumstances was refused, although an ameliorative direction was given. Beazley JA (as her Honour then was), with whom Hislop J agreed, R S Hulme J dissenting, held that the ameliorative direction given was sufficient, and that it was not an error for the trial judge to refuse to discharge the jury.

16Finally, in Santo v R [2009] NSWCCA 269, the accused was on trial for robbery in company. In cross-examination she said that for 11 or 12 months before the date of the alleged offence she had been in custody. The trial judge refused to discharge the jury. The Court of Criminal Appeal (constituted by Young JA, Hidden and Latham JJ) held that that decision was open to the discretion of the trial judge. 

17My review of some of the leading authorities shows that the High Court of Australia and the Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales do not require or encourage trial judges to take an overly sensitive approach to the accidental receipt of prejudicial material. That review also shows that in many circumstances a direction is an appropriate remedy, not the discharge of the whole jury, although of course every case will turn upon its own facts.

18In short the authorities demonstrate that it is well established that the decision to discharge a jury is a discretionary one. A trial judge should take into account a number of factors including but not limited to the extent of the prejudice to the accused; the ability to ameliorate that prejudice to any degree by direction, comment or other step; and the stage that the proceedings have reached. As I have said, the ultimate question is whether a high degree of necessity for the discharge of the jury has been established in all of the circumstances. 

Determination

19As for the last factor to which I referred, namely the stage that the proceedings have reached, that militates, in my opinion, rather strongly against discharge. The trial has proceeded now for over two weeks. It has involved evidence from very many civilians, police, and a number of experts, including more than one witness who has travelled from interstate. The trial included a view of the scene that took a whole day. Of course questions of convenience are not determinative, and obviously no matter what the time, trouble or expense involved, a trial that had been prejudiced to the point of becoming unfair could not continue, whatever the inconvenience. 

20However, I do not consider that the test of a high degree of necessity has been made out in this case. That opinion is founded upon a number of factors. 

21First, in the circumstances described by me it is not completely clear that the jury indeed heard the offending passage. 

22Secondly, if some or all of them did hear it, is not completely clear that they would have necessarily interpreted what was said as demonstrating that the accused had had fingerprints taken on an earlier occasion. 

23Thirdly, I consider that the extract from page 7 of the transcript to which I have referred has at least some flavour of the witness speaking in generalities and not with regard to this particular case. 

24Fourthly, the remedial steps immediately taken by the Crown Prosector were, with respect, appropriate, though I accept that there is perhaps a danger that they had the opposite effect from that which was intended. 

25Fifthly, the subsequent evidence-in-chief that I have extracted in my judgment made it perfectly clear that the witness was talking of comparing the fingerprints from the scene with fingerprints taken from the accused on 19 October 2011. Those were the last words that the jury heard about the matter. 

26Sixthly, there has been no evidence placed before me, and I did not discern myself contemporaneously, any consternation or hubbub on the part of the jury or anyone else in court when the evidence was given. 

27I accept that it constituted a regrettable slip in the trial for the witness to have said what he said, rather than simply focussing on the comparison between the crime scene fingerprints and the fingerprints of the accused taken on arrest for this matter. But I am not satisfied in the circumstances of this case that that regrettable slip should lead me to discharge the jury. 

28Finally, as I indicated in discussion and subject to hearing submissions from the learned Crown Prosecutor, I am prepared to say anything reasonably appropriate to the jury that defence counsel may seek to have me say. That would include, if he so wishes, a direction highlighting the evidence and asking the jury to completely ignore it. Or I have already in discussion suggested, as a possibility a comment to the jury that may or may not commend itself to defence counsel. Whether it would be better to leave the evidence entirely is of course a matter for the consideration of defence counsel. 

29In short, I am not satisfied, in all of the circumstances of this particular case, that there is a high degree of necessity for the jury to be discharged, and the application for that to occur is respectfully rejected.

2706792,Chapman v R [2013] NSWCCA 91,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Adamson J.
2DAVIES J: I agree with Adamson J.
Introduction3ADAMSON J:  The applicant seeks leave to appeal pursuant to s 5Fof the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the dismissal by Arnott DCJ of his notice of motion seeking, relevantly, an order that count 1 of the indictment be quashed on the grounds of duplicity under s 17(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.
4Count 1 of the indictment relevantly charges the applicant with an offence contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (the Act) as follows:1. On 9 February 2011 at Coonamble in the State of New South Wales, supplied a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine, in an amount of 61.19 grams.
5The applicant lived in a house in Coonamble and used a utility, which was owned by his employer and was parked in the street outside the house.  In the course of the execution of a search warrant 224 methylamphetamine tables were found in the kitchen pantry of the house and 5 were found in the ashtray in the utility. The tablets that were found in the utility were yellow and diamond-shaped and were similar in appearance to those found in the pantry.
6Section 25(1) of the Act provides:A person who supplies, or who knowingly takes part in the supply of, a prohibited drug is guilty of an offence.
7Section 29 of the Act provides that, with some exceptions:A person who has in his or her possession an amount of a prohibited drug which is not less than the traffickable quantity of the prohibited drug shall, for the purposes of this Division, be deemed to have the prohibited drug in his or her possession for supply. 
8Section 3(1) of the Act provides for a wider definition of supply, which includes ""keeping or having in possession for supply"".
9The traffickable quantity of methylamphetamine is 3 grams.
10It was common ground that the methylamphetamine in the five tablets weighs less than 3 grams. Accordingly, the applicant could be convicted of count 1 if the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt either that:
(1)The applicant was in possession of the tablets in the kitchen pantry and the tablets in the ashtray of the utility; or
(2)The applicant was in possession of the tablets in the kitchen pantry; or
(3)The applicant was keeping or had possession of the five tablets in the ashtray of the utility for supply.
11The first two possible alternatives depend on there being consensus that the applicant was in possession of the tablets in the kitchen pantry. If the jury was satisfied only that the applicant was in possession of the tablets in the ashtray, then a guilty verdict would only be open if it found the requisite mental element for supply since the deeming provision would not apply.
12The applicant postulated the example of six members of the jury being satisfied that the applicant was in possession of the tablets in the kitchen pantry, in which case the offence of supply would be established by the deeming provision, and the remaining six being satisfied that he had possession of the five tablets in the ashtray of the utility for the purposes of supply. 
13The applicant submitted before the Court below that the first count was bad for duplicity because he could be convicted by the jury in three separate circumstances and that the jury could come to a verdict of guilty notwithstanding that there was not the requisite consensus about the underlying facts.
Decision of the Court below14It appears from the reasons of the Court below that it was not clear whether the Crown relied on the third alternative or whether its case would be confined to the first two scenarios which would permit it to rely on the deeming provision. His Honour said in the reasons: ""If I have misunderstood the Crown case and it does not rely upon the third path to guilt to which I have referred then the Crown should make it clear to the defence and to the ultimate trial judge so that appropriate directions can be given to the jury.""
15The Court below found that the Crown was not alleging separate offences at different times (cf. S v The Queen [1989] HCA 66; 168 CLR 266 (S v The Queen)) or that possession of the five tablets and possession of the 229 tablets manifested itself in an offence at different times. On this basis the Court below found that there was no duplicity in count 1.
16The Court below, in analysing the question of the prejudice identified by the applicant addressed the submission that, if the jury convicted, the sentencing judge would not know on what basis the jury had convicted. His Honour rejected the submission and referred by analogy to manslaughter and said:""It is the task of the trial judge to make findings of facts relevant to sentencing. The primary constraint is that they must be consistent with a verdict of the jury. . . . In the case of manslaughter for example, it is open to the Crown to allege manslaughter on more than one basis. The only thing that is essential is that all members of the jury must conclude that the Crown has established the offence of manslaughter, however made out.""
Reasons
17In the course of the hearing of the application for leave to appeal, the Crown confirmed that it was relying only on deemed supply. In other words, it does not rely on the third alternative path to a guilty verdict of possession of the tablets in the utility for the purposes of supply.  Accordingly the possibility that a jury could return a guilty verdict on count 1 if six of its members were satisfied that the applicant possessed the 5 tablets in the utility for the purposes of supply and the remaining six were satisfied that he possessed the 224 tablets in the pantry, has been removed by the Crown's concession.
18In these circumstances, there is, in my view, no arguable ground for duplicity since it follows, as the reasons of the Court below make clear, that any guilty verdict requires that the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was in possession of at least the tablets in the kitchen pantry.19Had the three paths to a guilty verdict remained open, it would have been a nice question whether the indictment involved duplicity. The object of the rule against duplicity has always been that there should be no uncertainty as to the offence charged: Chief Constable of Norfolk v Clayton [1983] 2 AC 473. The rule against duplicity prohibits a single count in an indictment charging a person with the commission of more than one offence: S v The Queen at 280-281 per Toohey J, citing Archbold, Pleading, Evidence and Practice in Criminal Cases, 43 ed (1988), page 46.
20The Act, by s 25, creates an offence of supply of a certain type of drug. There is only one offence alleged: the supply of methylamphetamine. As Simpson J (Hoeben J agreeing) said in R v Yildiz [2006] NSWCCA 97; 160 A Crim R 218 (Yildiz) at [29] of s 3 of the Act:""[It] does not create a series of different offences of supplying prohibited drugs. It creates a single such offence, which may be proved in a variety of ways. One mode of proving supply is to prove a relevant agreement; another is to prove possession of the relevant quantity.""
21The facts in Yildiz were, however, materially different from the instant appeal. In Yildiz, the Crown case was put on two bases: first that the appellant had agreed to supply drugs to a man referred to as Thomson; and secondly, that there was a deemed supply because he was in possession of a traffickable quantity of the drugs found in the boot of his car. The drugs the subject of the agreement were the same drugs that were found in the boot of the car.
22In Yildiz, Simpson J (Hoeben J agreeing) considered at [30] that, notwithstanding the offence charged was a single offence of supply, the two different ways of proving supply: possession of a traffickable quantity or an agreement to supply were:""in reality two different offences. They were not alternatives. Nor is it correct, as I initially thought, to characterise them as different modes of proving the same charge, which would or could amount to simple alternatives. To this extent the directions suffered from the defects identified in S v The Queen: it is not possible to be confident that all members of the jury convicted on the basis of the alleged agreement, or, alternatively, that all members of the jury convicted on the basis of possession. Thus, the unanimity required may be absent.""
23Notwithstanding the potential for the lack of requisite unanimity, the majority in Yildiz found that although there was a latent duplicity in the directions given, there was no such latent duplicity in the indictment itself. For other reasons, related to the strength of the Crown case based on the deeming provision, the appeal in Yildiz was dismissed.
24The instant case is, in my view, distinguishable from Yildiz because in the instant case the drugs in the pantry that are the subject of the deeming provision, although the same type of drug, methylamphetamine, are not the same drugs as were found in the utility which are said to have been supplied because they were in the applicant's possession for the purposes of supply. Accordingly, the majority's conclusion in Yildiz that there was no latent duplicity in the indictment is not, in my view, determinative of the instant appeal.
25The cases draw a distinction, for the purpose of determining whether a count in an indictment is bad for duplicity, between alternative factual bases of liability on the one hand and alternative legal formulations of liability based on the same or substantially the same facts: R v Cramp [1999] NSWCCA 324; 110 A Crim R 198 (Cramp) at [65] per Barr J, Sully and Ireland JJ agreeing.
26In the instant case, but for the Crown's concession, the Crown could prove supply in any one of three ways: two methods involve proving possession of the drugs in the pantry but the third requires the Crown to prove that the applicant possessed the drugs in the utility for the purposes of supply. I consider that these amount to different factual bases of liability rather than alternative legal formulations of liability based on the same or substantially the same facts.
27I do not consider that the analogy with manslaughter is entirely apt. First, there are strong historical and practical reasons for not differentiating between the ways in which manslaughter can be established: see the discussion in R v Dally [2000] NSWCCA 162; 115 A Crim R 582 (Dally) at [64] per Smart AJ, Sully J and Carruthers AJ agreeing. These reasons include that manslaughter is available as an alternative verdict to murder although it does not appear on the indictment as a separate and alternative count and that it is generally inadvisable for a trial judge to question the jury as to the basis of a verdict of manslaughter, it being a matter for the sentencing judge to find the relevant facts consistently with the jury's verdict: R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 (Isaacs). Secondly, manslaughter is regarded as being sufficiently complicated for juries without introducing a further complication to the directions required to be given: Dally at [64](d), (e) and (j). Thirdly, the factual basis for the different types of manslaughter is commonly the same or similar: as in Cramp at [65] per Barr J. This is, however, not invariably the case: see R v Klamo [2008] VSCA 75; (2008) 184 A Crim R 262, where the acts said to constitute the unlawful and dangerous act causing death occurred on two separate occasions.
28The two categories of case referred to above were summarised in the following terms in Walsh v R [2002] VSCA 98; 131 A Crim R 299 by Phillips and Buchanan JJ at [57] with whom Ormiston JA agreed (footnotes omitted):""[T]he cases give rise to two situations at least . . . The first is that exemplified by the cases concerning murder and manslaughter, where, when alternative legal bases of guilt are proposed by the Crown but depend substantially upon the same facts, there is no need for a direction on ""unanimity"" about one or other or more of those bases, at least if they do not ""involve materially different issues or consequences"". (How far in cases of murder or manslaughter this qualification extends - having regard especially to Clarke and Johnstone which has been long accepted in Victoria and to the similar practice in New South Wales - is of no present relevance). The second situation is where one offence is charged, such as obtaining property by deception, but a number of discrete acts is relied upon as proof and any one of them would entitle the jury to convict. If those discrete acts go to the proof of an essential ingredient of the crime charged, then the jury cannot convict unless they are agreed upon that act which, in their opinion, does constitute that essential ingredient. In this type of case, much will depend ""upon the precise nature of the charge, the nature of the prosecution's case and the defence and what are the live issues at the conclusion of the evidence"". . . ""
29But for the Crown's concession, I consider the instant case to be in the second category: namely there is one offence charged but two acts are relied upon, proof of either one of which would entitle the jury to convict. I do not consider that the requisite degree of unanimity would be present if, say, six members of the jury were satisfied of the applicant's possession of the drugs in the pantry (thereby attracting the deeming provision) and the remaining six were satisfied that the applicant had possession of the drugs in the utility for the purposes of supply.
30Because of the Crown's concession which removes any arguable duplicity, it is not necessary to decide whether this conclusion requires count 1 of the indictment to be quashed or whether the matter were better left to the directions of the trial judge.
31I respectfully agree with the observations of the Court below that the form of the indictment would not be an impediment to sentencing. If the jury returns a verdict of guilty of supply, it will be a matter for the sentencing judge to make findings of fact, consistent with the jury's verdict and the evidence at the trial, on the basis of which a sentence will be imposed, consistently with the principles in Isaacs at 380 and R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270 at [27], per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Hayne and Callinan JJ.
32The orders I propose are:
(1)Extend time for filing the application for leave to appeal.
(2)Leave to appeal granted.
(3)Appeal dismissed.

2706793,R v Garry SAGE [2013] NSWDC 216,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE


1I am sentencing a young man who at the very commencement of his adult life has committed a series of very serious crimes with damaging consequences for the victim, a person just at that stage commencing her teenage years. 

2I am sentencing Garry Sage for six offences and in due course I will have to deal with another two less serious offences. The six offences that I am sentencing him for are these.

3There are four offences of sexual intercourse with a person aged 14 to 16 years. They are offences against s 66C(3) of the Crimes Act 1900. Parliament has fixed a maximum of 10 years imprisonment to that crime.

4I am also sentencing Garry Sage for two offences of possessing or producing child pornography. They are offences against s 91H(2) of the Crimes Act. Again, Parliament regards those crimes as so serious that it has attached a maximum of 10 years imprisonment to the offence.

5In due course I will also have to deal with two offences of contravening an apprehended domestic violence order under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.

6It is important for a judge in sentencing someone to give a brief account of what happened or what the events were which amounted to the crimes so that a proper assessment can be made of how serious the offences were. 

7Garry Sage made friends with a girl named Rachel Grey. I say at this stage that that name is not to be repeated outside this courtroom to anyone who is not in the courtroom. The law in this State is that the victim of sexual offences is entitled to their privacy. It is an offence to identify outside the courtroom to anyone who is not in the courtroom, the name of the person or any means of identifying the person who is the victim of sexual assaults. That law applies in this case.

8Garry Sage and Rachel Grey met on 17 September 2011 when Garry Sage took her back to his mother's place where he was living. Garry Sage was then 19 and Rachel Grey was 14. They spent time together later that afternoon and then in his bedroom they began to kiss. They continued up to the point of being about to have sexual intercourse when Garry Sage said ""Are you sure you wanted to do this, cause once you do it you can't take it back"" and Rachel Grey replied, ""Yes, it's fine"". They then engaged in sexual intercourse in the conventional sense of penile vaginal sexual intercourse. About a week later they met again and again engaged in sexual intercourse. That was on 24 September 2011.

9A couple of months later on 30 December 2011, Rachel Grey was about to depart on holidays with her family and she and Garry Sage were at her family home. They again engaged in sexual intercourse. On 30 January 2012 the police were granted a search warrant and found some images on Garry Sage's computer. One of the images was a photograph of Rachel Grey's buttocks with a black texta inserted in her rectum. Garry Sage acknowledged that he had placed it there and that it was Rachel Grey. That act by law amounts to sexual intercourse and that is therefore the fourth crime of sexual intercourse that I am sentencing Garry Sage for.

10Police also found on his laptop computer a series of photographs which he had, he said, taken of Rachel Grey. They included photographs of his penis penetrating her vagina and a close-up photograph of her vagina with the writing ""The [Mr Sage's nickname] Pussy"", written above the vagina. There was also a photograph of her lying face down on a bed. There were other photographs of her as well. 

11This was not all. In addition, there were 39 or 40 images of child abuse material or child pornography. These were not of Rachel Grey but of unidentified children. Garry Sage admitted to the police that he had deliberately downloaded the pornography and that he had visited a particular site on numerous occasions.

12On 13 February 2012, the police applied for an apprehended violence order. That was to protect Rachel Grey from Garry Sage. The order was granted. Garry Sage twice breached that apprehended violence order. He wrote a three page letter to Rachel Grey and then in early April 2012 he picked her up from her home and took her for a drive and spoke to her. They were, as I said, breaches of the apprehended violence order which was taken out for Rachel Grey's protection.

13On 13 April 2012, Garry Sage was arrested. He was interviewed. He admitted to the breaches of the apprehended violence order. He admitted to being in a sexual relationship with the 14 year old Rachel Grey. He had in the meantime, I should add, himself turned 20. He admitted having penile vaginal intercourse with her on numerous times at her house and in his house. He admitted filming the sexual intercourse on his phone. He admitted knowing that she was aged 14 and he admitted that he knew the consequences of his actions.

14I have taken this summary of what occurred that resulted in Garry Sage being charged from the agreed facts which are part of exhibit A in this case.

15After he was arrested Garry Sage spent 3 days in custody before he was granted bail.

16The reasons why having sexual relations with a child of Rachel Grey's age is wrong are well known and are the basis for Parliament making the activity illegal. In a case called R v Lee [2010] NSWCCA 88, the Court of Criminal Appeal in this State, through McClellan CJ at CL, quoted a passage from the judge of this Court from whom the appeal was brought. At [15] of the Court of Criminal Appeal judgment, that extract appears. Part of it explains this law. The late Judge Goldring, in the passage quoted, said this:

""Offences involving sexual activities with young people under the age of sixteen are regarded as serious because the law presumes that such people do not have the emotional maturity to be able to make informed judgments about activities which may have very serious consequences for them.""

17In this case Rachel Grey has provided a victim impact statement regarding the effect which the crimes perpetrated against her have had. I have read that victim impact statement very carefully. It is a very articulate description of the impact of such crimes and why they are made crimes. The victim impact statement comes from a school child who was at the relevant time in Year 8, facing so many of the usual adolescent issues, including friends, family, schoolwork and fitness. It is obviously important to her and to the community that teenagers are able to go through those stages without significant interference and with significant support. As she said, before she met Garry she was ""an innocent, happy little girl"". She said that she had ""everything in the palm of my hand"" and included ""a happy relationship with my family, amazing friends, best grades at school."" She correctly observed that she did not deserve what happened to her. She then said that Garry Sage ""took away parts of my life, my innocence, parts of me that I will never get back"". She describes, as I said, very articulately, the impact which this crime has had on her.

18I should add this in case it is thought that I am regarding the contents of the victim impact statement as a specially aggravating feature which should aggravate or make more serious the sentence which I have to impose. It is not a specially aggravating feature. It is, I repeat, a very clear statement of why Parliament enacts laws such as the ones that Garry Sage has offended against. 

19I have been very much assisted by both Mr A Benetatos, who appeared for Garry Sage and by Ms C Summerfield who appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions. Both of them have provided me with a good deal of help in what I regard as a difficult sentencing exercise.

20Ms Summerfield, in her written submissions, emphasised certain things which make these crimes especially serious. She submitted, and I accept, that Rachel Grey was in the lower end of the age range of 14 to 16 years for the crime. That is not to say that to commit an offence against a 16 year old is in some way better, but it is to emphasise the obvious point that the younger a person is in the age range provided for by this crime, then the more serious the offence and the impact that it is likely to have upon the victim.

21Ms Summerfield also submitted, and I accept, that there was a relationship of trust between Garry Sage and Rachel Grey. He had asserted his love for her. He was 5 years older and up to 6 years older than she was. As Ms Summerfield said, and I accept, Rachel Grey ""should have been able to trust that he would not abuse her adolescent vulnerability, and the legislation is in place to recognise his responsibility in this regard."" 

22I also agree that there was a degree of exploitation so far as the speed at which the relationship developed into a sexual one. It was on one of their very first meetings as individuals that sexual intercourse occurred.

23I accept Ms Summerfield's submission that overall the sexual intercourse offences fall at the lower end of the middle of the range of seriousness for these kinds of offences.

24There is a pre-sentence report which has been prepared by the Probation and Parole Service about Garry Sage which said that he ""tended to minimise the seriousness of his offending behaviour and stated that 'I was in love with the girl and the sex was consensual'"". It was pointed out that he seemed to show a lack of empathy for the victim.

25Mr Benetatos called his client to give evidence. During his evidence he expressed his remorse and regret and he said that he had read the victim impact statement and appreciated the damage which he had done to Rachel Grey. He is living at [place] and has some employment at [place]. He had been seeing a psychiatrist in [place] and is looking for another one to see.

26In cross-examination he acknowledged that he had engaged in sex at their first significant physical meeting and said that he thought at the time that Rachel Grey was mature enough for the sexual relationship. He said the photographs of her were used for his own sexual pleasure and it was his idea. He had also written graffiti on her body. He acknowledged that his behaviour had brought about some disruption within her family and in fact that it became a wedge between her and her family. He regarded her personality as very compatible and their friendship as compatible but said that the ""age was the problem"". He acknowledged that he needs additional therapy for his own benefit.

27There was also made available a report by the respected forensic psychiatrist, Dr Stephen Allnutt. Dr Allnutt saw and examined Garry Sage for the purposes of the sentence proceedings. He regarded Mr Sage as ""falling into the lower end of the risk scale for future sexual recidivism."" He thought, given the information provided by Mr Sage, that there was a ""biological predisposition to a mental condition"" and that Mr Sage had demonstrated ""significant behavioural problems from a young age in childhood that have persisted through his life"". He thought that Mr Sage had an underlying mood disturbance. He held back from making a diagnosis of paedophilia, despite the interest in the child pornography material. 

28Mr Sage himself had acknowledged in cross-examination that his interest in it was more because of its illegal nature or the fact that it was regarded as taboo, rather than for sexual pleasure. It was, as he said, its shock value. 

29Mr Sage has no record of any earlier criminal convictions. That has limited benefit in a case such as this because he has used his good character, so to speak, as part of a way of getting trust from his victim.

30I accept Mr Benetatos' submission that his client now has more insight into his behaviour and into the impact which he has had on the victim of his crimes, including the victims not known to the Court who were depicted in the general pornographic photographs.

31Mr Benetatos emphasised his client's need for ongoing treatment and I accept that submission. As Mr Benetatos said, his client is still a young man. That is a matter which has concerned me significantly. He has a complex psychological background and make-up and left school at the end of Year 9. He comes from a very supportive family and is complying with his medication. He has expressed remorse and contrition in his evidence and, as he said, has shown some insight into what he has done. He cooperated with the police and as, Ms Summerfield acknowledged, entered his plea of guilty at the earliest available opportunity. 

32I have taken into account, the submissions of both Mr Benetatos and Ms Summerfield.

33The main issue, it seems to me, was the question of whether I should sentence Mr Sage to a penalty which involves full-time custody. Mr Benetatos argued that the option was open for a non-custodial sentence. It would have to be a suspended sentence because other non-custodial options or other imprisonment sentences which can be served other than in full-time custody are not available. Ms Summerfield argued that this is a case that should be met with a period of full-time custody.

34This is not a case where the offender has had a one off sexual encounter with a schoolgirl but he has committed a series of acts of sexual intercourse over a period of some months. It is not a case of an offender downloading sexual images of child pornography, a crime in itself, from the internet. He committed that crime but in addition he has taken degrading photographs of the victim of his other offences.

35Each of the six offences I am sentencing him for carries a maximum of 10 years imprisonment. As the Court of Criminal Appeal said through the Chief Judge at Common Law in R v Lee [2010] NSWCCA 88 at [31] -

""Our community has indicated through the Parliament that such relationships are forbidden and if they occur the older person will be severely punished. It may be that if the offender was of a significantly younger age than that of the respondent at the time of the offences a more benign attitude would be appropriate.""

36In that case the age difference was some nine years. In this case the age difference is five years. I do not regard that as an ameliorating factor so far as Mr Sage is concerned. He was significantly older in my opinion than Rachel Grey, even though he was himself on the threshold of his adult life.

37I have decided, given the number of serious offences and the different kinds of offences which he has committed, that I have no choice but to send Mr Sage to gaol. I will impose sentences of imprisonment, or indicate sentences of imprisonment, for each of the six serious crimes and then I propose to fix one aggregate sentence.

38I regard an appropriate penalty for each of the four offences of sexual intercourse with a child aged 14, as 3 years imprisonment. I regard an appropriate penalty for the child pornography offence involving images of Rachel Grey, as one of 3 years imprisonment. I regard an appropriate penalty for the other child pornography offence involving unidentified children, as one of 2½ years imprisonment.

39I would not have imposed each of those sentences one after the other so that they would amount to a large number of years. But nor would I fix them all to be served over exactly the same period so that there would be a 3 year sentence. I would have commenced each of the 3 remaining sexual intercourse sentences 2 months after the previous one. I would have commenced the child pornography offence of 3 years, 3 months after the last sexual intercourse offence sentence and I would have commenced the last child pornography offence, again after another 3 months. The total result that I would have come to and which I would regard as an appropriate sentence is one of 4 years imprisonment. 

40However I have to add this. Mr Sage pleaded guilty. He pleaded guilty at the very earliest opportunity. That means that Rachel Grey did not have to come to Court to give evidence in a contested trial and the resources of the State so far as criminal justice is concerned have been saved. I would therefore reduce the penalty by 25 per cent from 4 years imprisonment to one of 3 years imprisonment.

41For a sentence of 3 years imprisonment the non-parole period - that is, the period that must be served in custody - would normally be 27 months - 2 years and 3 months - but Parliament has permitted a judge to alter that relationship between the non-parole period and the overall sentence where there are special circumstances to make that adjustment. I regard there being special circumstances in this case. It is the first time that he has been in custody. He will need treatment and supervision for a longer period when he is released from custody. However, the most significant special circumstance in my opinion, is related to Mr Sage's age. He is now 21. He has never committed a crime before but, as I said, he has now committed - just after becoming an adult - a series of very serious criminal offences. I am very conscious of the impact of sending such a young person into gaol. However, in my opinion, the offences are so serious that I must impose that sentence. The community would expect it.

42The sentence will be 3 years. However, I propose to take an extraordinary step and reverse the usual ratio for a non-parole period. The non-parole period which I propose to fix is 9 months. The balance of the term will be 27 months. That is, I acknowledge, an extraordinarily short non-parole period but the main factor which I have in mind in fixing that is the age of this young man and the stage he is at in life. I also bear in mind the need that he has to deal with his psychological problems and the issues which have brought about this criminal offending. The best way for that to happen in my opinion will be in the community and supervised by psychologists and psychiatrists. 

43I am going to sentence you now, Garry Sage. You need to stand up. I am going to backdate the sentence by 3 days to Tuesday 30 April to make up for the 3 days that you have already served. I fix a non-parole period of 9 months to commence on 30 April 2013 and to expire on 29 January 2014. The balance of the term will be 27 months commencing on 30 January 2014 and expiring on 29 April 2017. Under s 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I make an order directing your release from custody and on parole on 29 January 2014.

HIS HONOUR: Okay. Have a seat Garry Sage. Now there's a few things. The first, the dates and things like that. I need you both to check the dates to make sure that I have them correct. It is a sentence of 3 years commencing 30 April 2013, expiring 29 April 2017. Non-parole period, 9 months, 30 April 2013, expiring 29 January 2014. Balance of the term, 27 months, 30 January 2014 to 29 April 2017.
SUMMERFIELD: Yes your Honour.
BENETATOS: 2016 your Honour.
SUMMERFIELD: 29 April 2016.
HIS HONOUR: I'm wrong. 

44The sentence expires 29 April 2016. 

HIS HONOUR: Mr Benetatos, there is one thing I forgot or I may have asked you last time. There is a detailed report as we know from Dr Allnutt and the - did I mention this?
BENETATOS: Yes you have your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Do you have instructions?
BENETATOS: I do. I have instructions to consent to that material being provided to Corrective Services.
HIS HONOUR: Thank you very much okay.
BENETATOS: That will be very helpful.
HIS HONOUR: Now that will probably happen on Monday, I think, when my usual associate is back. She has the contact there. I think exhibit B comprises both of them and I am going to write here, Child Pornography exhibits - not to be opened except by order of a District Court Judge or Judge in a higher jurisdiction.
Now conditions of parole. I think I am right. I have ordered his release on parole because it is a sentence of 3 years. So I fix conditions of parole. What should they be? Are you seeing someone down there yet at [place]? No, okay. I guess supervision by the Probation and Parole Service and accept whatever recommendations and directions they give. I think I would leave it up to them.
BENETATOS: That would cover it.
HIS HONOUR: Do you agree Ms Summerfield?
SUMMERFIELD: I think so your Honour. They would normally refer someone to the sex offenders program after an assessment by them. Yes.
HIS HONOUR: I think I'll leave that to them to assess.
SUMMERFIELD: I think that's appropriate your Honour.
BENETATOS: I've got no problem with that.
HIS HONOUR: Yes.

45Mr Sage is to be released upon parole on the date 29 January 2014. The conditions of his parole are: (1) That he be of good behaviour; (2) That he attend court if he receives a notice to do so; (3) That he accepts supervision from the Probation and Parole Service and all reasonable recommendations or directions of an officer of that Service.

HIS HONOUR: I need to explain it all to Mr Sage in a moment but it's reasonably straightforward so to speak. Are there any other matters that I need to attend to, Mr Benetatos or Ms Summerfield?
SUMMERFIELD: Yes. The sentence in relation to the contraventions of the two orders your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: What's the penalty? What's the maximum - I think I noted it.
SUMMERFIELD: I think it's 2 years and/or 50 penalty units, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: What do you propose that I do, Mr Benetatos?
BENETATOS: Given the circumstances, if I can be so bold as to suggest to the rising of the Court.
HIS HONOUR: I don't think that's an order anymore but I think there is something equivalent. What do you say Ms Summerfield?
SUMMERFIELD: I was thinking a s 10A conviction your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Yes. I think that's right.
BENETATOS: Yes that's right.
HIS HONOUR: That's it.

46For the two offences referred to in the certificate under s 166(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, under s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I convict Garry Sage of those two offences of contravene apprehended domestic violence order and I dispose of the proceedings without imposing any other penalties. 

HIS HONOUR: I don't need to sign this, do I?
SUMMERFIELD: No your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: No, but it stays with the court papers. Is there anything else I need to do apart from explain the sentences?
SUMMERFIELD: Just one other thing your Honour. The Crown would be seeking destruction orders for a number of items referred to in the property seizure form completed during the search of the offender's house. If I could hand up the property seizure form and seek destruction of the following items.
HIS HONOUR: Let's have a look.
SUMMERFIELD: On page A18335, items number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 12, and on the following page A18336, items number 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 26 and 28 and in addition, if they're not included there and I couldn't see that they were, the two videos that were the subject of sequence 8 now on indictment.
HIS HONOUR: Are they exhibits?
SUMMERFIELD: They weren't exhibits no.
HIS HONOUR: All right. Have you seen this list - I'll pass it down to Mr Benetatos.
BENETATOS: I haven't your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: I've just put a red ring around each of the ones that Ms Summerfield named. You have a look at it. Tell me when you've looked and then I'll hear Ms Summerfield again.
BENETATOS: If I could be permitted to speak to my client?
HIS HONOUR: Yes you may.
BENETATOS: Your Honour, I'm told by [Mr Sage], item number 3 is a Sony PlayStation PS3. There was no inappropriate material on that. It's a game console basically and the item number 26 is an 80 gig iPod. That was owned by [Mr Sage's] sister and again there was nothing inappropriate on that.
HIS HONOUR: Three and?
BENETATOS: Item number 3 and item number 26.
HIS HONOUR: Okay show that to - yes?
SUMMERFIELD: Your Honour, I understand the officer in-charge is in court. The Crown wouldn't press those two items.
HIS HONOUR: Okay thank you.
BENETATOS: Thank you your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: If that document could be passed back.
BENETATOS: If they could be returned perhaps to me.
HIS HONOUR: I don't know. You have a talk to Ms Summerfield or with the officer-in-charge.
BENETATOS: The instructing officer is nodding at me. I assume that will be him.
HIS HONOUR: Okay. Three?
BENETATOS: I think it was 28 your Honour.
SUMMERFIELD: 26.
BENETATOS: 26 sorry.
HIS HONOUR: What do I order - under the Evidence Act or--
SUMMERFIELD: I haven't actually got the section with me your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: We can look it up later on.

47I order the destruction of the items circled in red with the exception of items 3 and 26 in the document which I mark for identification.

MFI #4 ITEMS CIRCLED IN RED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ITEMS 3 AND 26 IN THE DOCUMENT

HIS HONOUR: This is not an offence - there is some legislation called the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006. I don't think it applies.
SUMMERFIELD: Your Honour, I hadn't quite finished in relation to that destruction order.
HIS HONOUR: No thank you go ahead.
SUMMERFIELD: There are also electronically recordable devices such as laptops, phones and iPods, and the Crown would be seeking a destruction order in relation to those as well.
HIS HONOUR: On the list?
SUMMERFIELD: They're not on that list. That's an addition to the list.
HIS HONOUR: How do we identify them?
SUMMERFIELD: Sorry if I could just get some instructions your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Yes get instructions. They just need to be identified, that's all. So there's clarity in the order.
SUMMERFIELD: Sorry your Honour. We don't require any other orders in relation to the destruction order.
HIS HONOUR: All right. Is there anything else?
SUMMERFIELD: No there's not.
HIS HONOUR: Mr Benetatos?
BENETATOS: Not that I'm aware of your Honour.

48Garry Sage, I am sending you to gaol for the reasons that I have explained. That is why judges give reasons for their decisions. You have a 3 year gaol sentence. It commenced 3 days ago on 30 April 2013. It therefore finishes on 29 April 2016. The usual non-parole period would be 27 months. I have made it 9 months and that is significantly shorter because mainly of your age. You have the rest of your life to get on with and starting your adult life in gaol is not the best thing at all but for the reasons that I gave I am sending you to gaol. I have ordered your release on parole on 29 January next year, you will be released on parole. After that you have to accept, it is a condition of your parole, supervision by the Probation and Parole Service and let them help you. They are trained to help and let them help you get on with the rest of your life. That supervision may be up to 27 months. Whilst that 27 months is going you are still under your gaol sentence and if you misbehave yourself in some way, you come back before me and you may go back to gaol or the Parole Authority may revoke your parole and you just go back into gaol. I do not think that will happen. The other thing is that at the end of the sentence or whenever the supervision ends, they will discharge you. If you get a notice asking you to come to court during your parole you must come along to court and you must stay out of trouble. Now do you understand all that?

OFFENDER: Yes.
HIS HONOUR: Okay then. Have you got some family here in court today?
OFFENDER: My father.
HIS HONOUR: All right. I will go off the Bench in a moment and if he wants to have a quick word with you before you are taken away he may do so but that is up to the Corrective Services officers, not me. It might be easier for him to see you just before you are taken down. Nothing else? I'll now adjourn.

		12 November 2013",2013-05-02 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2706794,Hillsley v R [2013] NSWCCA 78,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ AT CL: I agree with Slattery J.

2SLATTERY J: The applicant, Cameron Charles Hillsley seeks leave under Criminal Appeal Act 1912 s 5(1)(c) to appeal against a sentence that his Honour Acting Judge Puckeridge QC imposed upon him after a trial on indictment at the Wagga Wagga District Court on 7 October 2011.

Offence and Sentence

3After a trial on 3, 4 and 5 August 2011 a jury found the applicant guilty of one count of ""Aggravated Break Enter and Steal"" in contravention of Crimes Act 1900 s 112(2). The offence occurred at Wagga Wagga during the evening of 24 and 25 July 2010. The aggravating circumstances were that the applicant committed the offence in company, with two other persons, Michael Dennis and Rachel Miller.

4Crimes Act s 112 (2) carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment, and a standard non-parole period of 5 years under Crimes (Sentencing Procedure Act) 1995 s 54A. The learned trial judge sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for 46 months (3 years and 10 months) to commence on 5 August 2011 and expire on 4 June 2015, with a non-parole period of 26 months (2 years and 2 months) to expire on 3 October 2013.

5After each pleading guilty to the same Crimes Act s 112 (2) charge, the applicant's co-accused Michael Dennis and Rachel Miller gave evidence for the Crown at the applicant's trial. But his Honour Acting Judge Puckeridge QC did not sentence Mr Dennis and Ms Miller. Her Honour Judge English had sentenced them on 10 June 2011. 

6The applicant's Notice of Application for leave to Appeal filed on 2011 notified two grounds of appeal: Ground 1 - the applicant has a justified sense of grievance due to the disparity of the sentence imposed upon him and the sentences imposed upon the co-offenders, Mr Dennis and Ms Miller; and, Ground 2 - that the sentence imposed upon him was manifestly excessive.

The Facts

7In his remarks on sentence his Honour Acting Judge Puckeridge QC set out his findings as to the relevant circumstances of the offence of the applicant and his co-offenders on 24 and 25 July 2010. As his Honour declared in his remarks on sentence (""ROS"") these findings were closely based on her Honour Judge English's remarks on sentence for her Honour's sentencing of Mr Dennis and Ms Miller (ROS at 1). On this appeal neither the applicant nor the Crown challenge his Honour's findings as to these circumstances. So these findings are set out here in full. 

8His Honour's findings describe a scene of the applicant: soliciting Mr Dennis and Ms Miller to participate in acts of break and enter at the Wagga Wagga commercial premises of the business Riverina Tyre Power; and, then organising and theft of tyres from these premises. The facts his Honour found include the applicant and his co-offenders: making two journeys to the premises; and, co-operating in the removal of the tyres to the applicant's property, before police intercepted them during the second journey. Here are his Honour's findings (ROS at 1-3): 

""Late in the evening on Saturday 24 July 2010 the prisoner attended 8 Cameron Street, Ashmont, which were the premises where Mr Dennis and Ms Miller were residing. At the premises he solicited the assistance of both Mr Dennis and Ms Miller in participating in a proposed break and enter at Tyre Power in Wagga Wagga.

In the evening of 24 July 2010 all three left in a white Holden Commodore registered to Ms Miller. She, Ms Miller, was the driver of the vehicle. They drove to other premises in Ashmont Avenue where they obtained a cordless drill and hooked up a trailer to the vehicle driven by Ms Miller. After that she, Ms Miller, drove to the premises of the Riverina Tyre Power at Dobney Avenue, parking adjacent to the rear perimeter of certain fencing of those premises. With the use of some wire cutters the prisoner cut the top two strands of barbed wire above the fence enclosing the premises and all three scaled the fence. Mr Dennis, utilising the cordless drill, removed a number of screws securing the steel sheeting panelling on a roller door located at the rear of the premises and he and the prisoner entered the building whilst Ms Miller remained outside. Dennis and the prisoner then commenced to pass a number of tyres out to Ms Miller. Dennis and the prisoner exited the premises and all three rolled the tyres to the perimeter fence and assisted each other in passing the tyres over the fence and securing them in the trailer. Ms Miller then drove Dennis and the prisoner back to 152 Ashmont Avenue where the tyres were placed in the rear shed at those premises. 

All three returned to the Riverina Tyre premises and repeated the process. On route back to the Ashmont Avenue premises to place the then stolen goods back in the rear shed of the premises at 152 Ashmont Avenue police noted the manner of driving of the vehicle and followed the vehicle to the Ashmont Avenue address. When they approached the vehicle to speak to the driver the prisoner decamped from the scene. Miller and Dennis were questioned by police and subsequently arrested. The goods were located and recovered and all the goods were returned to the owner at the Riverina Tyre Power premises. 

The prisoner maintained his plea of not guilty and maintained that he was in fact not involved in the break and enter. He stated at certain stages that he could not be in two places at the same time and that he was in fact, as at the time of the break and entering, at a bucks party in Wagga Wagga. The bucks party was held actually by a person by the name of Di Bicccari. He gave evidence at the trial. He indicated that he had been and was affected by alcohol but that he understood that the then accused, now prisoner, was at the Victoria Hotel with him at the time. 

The verdict of the jury means that the Court, in sentencing the prisoner, must sentence him on the basis that the jury have accepted the evidence of Miller and Dennis that he was in fact with them. Not only that he was with them but he was the organiser and had solicited their assistance.""

9As his Honour sentenced the applicant on the basis of the jury's acceptance of the evidence of the two co-offenders, he concluded in this passage ""the jury have accepted the evidence of Miller and Dennis that he was in fact with them. Not only that he was with them but he was the organiser and had solicited their assistance."" This finding was common to both his sentencing proceedings and the sentencing proceedings for Mr Dennis and Ms Miller.

The Applicant's Subjective Circumstances

10His Honour gave extensive consideration to the applicant's subjective circumstances. He noted (ROS at 3) the applicant's youth: that the applicant was born on 10 November 1987 and was almost 24 years of age at the time of sentencing (7 October 2011).

11His Honour noted (ROS at 3) the applicant's prior criminal history. This history over the period 2003 to 2010 (see Particulars of Trial (Previous Convictions) was constituted by multiple driving offences, including driving whilst disqualified, and two similar offences: two counts of break and enter with intent to steal in 2004, and another count of break and enter with intent to steal in 2006. He received bonds from the Children's Court for both these offences, with a suspended sentence for the 2006 offence. 

12His Honour noted (ROS at 3-4) the written evidence, which the applicant adduced from a psychologist, Ms Kathryn Wakeley. He considered a number of aspects of Ms Wakeley's report: that the applicant's ""IQ falls within the significantly sub-average range""; that his IQ score fell within ""the extremely low range"" for verbal measures, and his performance score was within ""the borderline range""; that the applicant's verbal skills are an area of ""definite weakness""; and that the applicant would be helped by a ""short period of psychotherapy"" to assist with symptoms of ""stress, depression and any ongoing difficulties with past trauma""; the ""trauma"" was due to the death of a close friend in a car accident in which the applicant was involved and for which death he felt a degree of responsibility. From this intelligence testing his Honour concluded that, ""matters of general deterrence are not of the same significance"" as they would be ""when considering a case of a person with perhaps a higher intelligence.""

13His Honour further noted (ROS at 4) the applicant's limited education: pointing out that he had left school in year 9 and ""has considerable difficulty in reading and writing"" and that any skills that he has will be ""mainly as labourer."" Ms Wakeley's report confirms that at high school in Wagga Wagga the applicant: had ""difficulty with literacy""; was in a class for students with mild intellectual disability: but although he had not been able to complete any further education since leaving school; had managed to obtain a licence to drive a forklift, although the (non-practical) theory parts of this qualification he had found difficult to master. 

14The applicant is married with two children, as his Honour found. The Applicant's family became the source of a number of positive observations that his Honour made about the applicant. After setting a non-parole period his Honour considered, under Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act s 44(2) that there were ""special circumstances"" allowing the balance of the term of the sentence to exceed one third of the non-parole period. His Honour found special circumstances in the evidence adduced on sentence and especially the applicant's evidence about the applicant's changed outlook: (1) ""that he must now do his best to look after his wife and family""; and (2) ""that to use the term that he used to his wife, [that he needs] to 'grow up'"". 

15In similar vein his Honour noted (ROS at 4) there was evidence of a good natured side of his character, in the following terms:

The evidence before me however is that he is a person who is in many ways good hearted. There are references of employers and also from the evidence of his wife that he is always willing to help anyone in any difficulty. He certainly showed that in relation to his wife when she was having difficulty with her latest pregnancy.


16Ms Wakefield's report (at 10) throws light on some of the applicant's motivation for the offence, which seems to have stemmed from a short sighted seizing of an opportunity for monetary gain to assist his family. Ms Wakefield says that the offence took place ""after a lengthy period of unemployment for [the applicant] in which he had struggled to find a job due to both physical and intellectual limitations"". His Honour seems to have accepted the genuineness of the applicant's motivation to assist his family. But he used criminal means to achieve that end when he committed the offence. And this, together with the applicant's evidence on sentence seems to have been one of the reasons that his Honour found ""special circumstances"" and applied a substantial discount to the applicant's standard non-parole period. 

17Finally Ms Wakefield's report (at 10) makes clear that the applicant was ""aware of the illegality and wrongfulness of his behaviour"" and that he ""demonstrated unprompted empathy for the owners of the business and remorse for his actions"". But despite this, his Honour noted that the applicant had pleaded not guilty. 

The Sentences imposed on the Co-offenders

18Her Honour Judge English sentenced Mr Dennis and Ms Miller on 10 June 2011. The general factual basis upon which his Honour Acting Judge Puckeridge QC sentenced the applicant was the same as that upon which her Honour Judge English sentenced Mr Dennis and Ms Miller. His Honour adopted the factual findings of her Honour's remarks on sentence, when sentencing the applicant after his trial.

19Mr Dennis made full admissions when apprehended by police, indicated a willingness to assist police, pleaded guilty before trial, and had the benefit of a finding on sentence that ""he was truly remorseful and contrite"". At the time of his sentence Mr Dennis was generally of good character. Although he had been convicted for some traffic offences, for which he had been placed on bonds to be of good behaviour and for which, at the time of his sentencing, the Probation and Parole Service was supervising him. Mr Dennis had been in a relationship with Ms Miller and had three children, two of them with her. He had trained as a fitter and turner but was unemployed at the time of his sentencing due to mental health issues. Indeed her Honour found in her remarks on sentence (English DCJ's ROS at 5) that he had ""an undiagnosed mental condition which may have in some way contributed to the situation in which he found himself at the time he committed this offence.""

20When sentencing Mr Dennis her Honour started with a sentence of 20 months and then applied two cumulative discounts totalling 40 per cent. Mr Dennis was allowed a 25 per cent discount for his plea of guilty and a further 15 per cent discount for the assistance given to the police and anticipated to be given, in relation to the then forthcoming trial of the applicant. In the result he was sentenced for his Crimes Act s 112(2) offence to a term of imprisonment for 12 months (English DCJ's ROS at 8). But under Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act s 12 her Honour ordered that execution of that sentence be suspended on condition that he enter into a good behaviour bond for a period of 12 months and to come before the Court if called upon to do so. No other supervision orders were placed upon Mr Dennis. The Probation and Parole Service were already supervising him for the traffic offences.

21Like Mr Dennis, Ms Miller made full admissions when apprehended by police, indicated a willingness to assist police, pleaded guilty before trial, and had the benefit of a finding on sentence that ""she was truly remorseful and contrite"". At the time of his sentence Ms Miller was generally of good character, having been convicted of a minor shoplifting offence when 18 years of age. But her Honour Judge English observed in her remarks on sentence (at 5-6) that Ms Miller: had suffered post-natal depression after the birth of her second child for which she was not taking medication at the time of he offences; was recently in employment and had struggled with the care of two young children and a partner with an undiagnosed mental condition. 

22Again like Mr Dennis, Ms Miller was allowed a 25 per cent discount for her plea of guilty and a further 15 per cent discount for the assistance given to the police and anticipated to be given, in relation to the then forthcoming trial of the applicant. Ms Miller was sentenced for her Crimes Act s 112(2) offence to a term of imprisonment for 12 months (English DCJ's ROS at 9). But under Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act s 12 her Honour ordered that execution of that sentence be suspended on condition that she enter into a good behaviour bond for a period of 12 months and come before the Court if called upon to do so.

23Her Honour Judge English found (English DCJ's ROS at 6-7): that Mr Dennis and Ms Miller were both ""struggling with ever increasing debt but with an inability to be able to seek assistance""; that ""there was a degree of pressure brought to bear upon these two by [the applicant]; and, that but for their ""precarious"" financial circumstances they would not have responded to the applicant's pressure and committed the offences. 

24At the time of the offences, Mr Dennis was 24, Ms Miller was 22, and the applicant was 22. 

Ground 1 - the Parity/Proportionality Ground

25The applicant claims a justified sense of grievance due to disparity between his sentence and the sentences of his co-offenders. The Crown submits that no sense of grievance is justified when all the circumstances are considered in conformity with applicable principle.

26Applicable principles. The High Court recently restated the sentencing parity principle in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 462 (""Green""). ""Equal justice"" embodies the norm expressed in the term ""equality before the law""; it requires that like cases be treated alike; but it also requires different outcomes in cases that are different is some relevant respect: Green at [28] per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ, and see Wong v R (2001) 207 CLR 584. Consistency in the punishment of offences against the criminal law ""is a reflection of the notion of equal justice"" and ""is a fundamental element in any rational and fair system of criminal justice"": Green at [28] and see Lowe v R (1984) 154 CLR 606, at 610 (""Lowe"") per Mason J. Equal justice finds expression in ""the parity principle"" which requires that like offenders be treated in a like manner: Green at [28] and see Leeth v Commonwealth (1992) 174 CLR 455 at 470, per Mason CJ, Dawson and McHugh JJ. The parity principle allows different sentences to be imposed on like offenders ""to reflect different degrees of culpability and/or different circumstances"": Green at [28] and see Postiglione v R (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 301 (""Postiglione""), per Dawson and Gaudron JJ. 

27The reason why a Court interferes to avoid a marked disparity with a sentence of a co-offender is that it considers that the disparity is such as to ""give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance"" or in other words that the disparity ""gives the appearance that justice has not been done"": Lowe at 610, per Gibbs CJ. But the parity principle does not involve any judgment about the feelings of the person complaining of disparity: Postiglione, at 323, per Gummow J and at 338, per Kirby J. Rather the sense of grievance is assessed by objective criteria: Green at [31]. The question is whether a reasonable mind looking overall at what has happened would see that the applicant's grievance is justified: Rae v R [2011] NSWCCA 211 at [61] and Shortland v R [2013] NSWCCA 4 at [113]. Whether the Court of Criminal Appeal intervenes or not ""lies very much within [its] discretion, and such intervention may occur when the sentence is ""not in itself manifestly excessive"": Lowe at 610, per Gibbs CJ. 

28The application of the parity principle requires the Court to compare the sentence imposed on each offender and an evaluation of their involvement in the commission of the offence and the subjective features of their case: the Court will ""refuse to intervene where disparity is justified by differences between co-offenders such as age, background, criminal history, general character, and the part that each has played in the relevant criminal conduct or enterprise"": Green at [28] and Lowe at 609 per Mason J. 

29In this case the application of the principle does not have the practical difficulties to which Campbell JA adverted in Jimmy v R (2010) 77 NSWLR 540, at 588-589 [201] - [203], where the co-offenders were charged with different crimes. Here each co-offender was charged with a single count under Crimes Act s 112(2). 

30Finally, if the Court finds an unjustified disparity, in the exercise of its discretion it is not required to reduce a co-offender's sentence to one which is inadequate: Green at [28]. 

31The Applicant's Submissions. The applicant's submissions on Ground 1 were in two parts (essentially two sub-grounds of appeal): the first part was that Acting Judge Puckeridge QC had proceeded to sentence the applicant without identifying the objective seriousness of the offence, an error which in substance it is inferred explains the disparity in sentences; and, the second part was that the disparity of sentences itself gave rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the applicant.

32For the following reasons I have found the Crown's contentions more persuasive on both parts of this ground of appeal. The applicant's submissions on this first ground are set out below, followed by my reasons for preferring the Crown's submissions made in response.

33Ground 1 - Part 1. In the first part of his submissions on Ground 1 the applicant pointed to ""a significant difference in the way that that each sentencing judge assessed the objective seriousness of the offence when giving reasons under Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act s 54B(2) for setting a non parole period shorter than the standard non parole period prescribed under Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act s 55 for the middle of the range of objective seriousness. The applicant argued by contrasting Judge English's remarks on the subject of objective seriousness with those of Acting Judge Puckeridge. 

34Judge English said (English DCJ's ROS at 7): ""Keeping in mind the benchmark of the standard non-parole period and having regard to the objective circumstances of the offence and the subjective circumstances of the offender, the pleas of guilty, the offers of assistance, I find that this matter falls well below the mid-range envisaged by the legislature.""

35Her Honour had earlier found that the matter fell below the middle of the range of objective seriousness for this offence because: (1) the aggravating factor of being in company (Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act s 21A(2)(e)) ""is one of the less serious factors of aggravation""; (2) the offence was committed by young persons; (3) the break and enter was to commercial premises that were not expected to be occupied at the time; and (4) the goods were recovered and damages to the premises were minimal.

36But Acting Judge Puckeridge said (ROS at 3) on the question of objective seriousness:

There is a standard non-parole period in relation to offences of this kind and that standard non-parole is a period of five years. I take that into account in relation to the sentence that I propose. I also take into account, other than on the evidence as found by the jury, that he was the person who planned the offence and organised other persons to be involved; that at the time of the commission of the offences he was on parole. Taking those matters into account I would consider that the appropriate sentence would be a period of imprisonment of four years.

37On the basis of this passage the applicant said in his written submissions that his Honour Acting Judge Puckeridge QC did not, in contrast to her Honour Judge English ""comment ... as to where the crime fits in terms of the objective seriousness of it, nor is there any comment [in his Honours remarks on sentence] about the fact that all the tyres that were stolen were returned and the damage done to the commercial property was minimal"". The applicant argued: that his Honour should, as Judge English did, have found that the offence ""fell well below the mid range of objective seriousness envisaged by the legislature"", and used that as the starting point for his Honour's reasoning; and, that his Honour's failure to do so led to the disparity in sentences that has occurred. 

38The Crown submissions dealt separately with this and with the next part of the applicant's submissions.

39Ground 1 - Part 2. In the second part of his submissions on Ground 1 the applicant acknowledged the differences between the applicant and his co-offenders but emphasized the similarities among them. The applicant acknowledged several differences: the course of the applicant's trial, his criminal record, and the degree of his organisation of the offence. The Crown submitted that these differences were of more marked significance than the applicant acknowledged. Moreover the Crown submitted that the similarities between the applicant's situation and that of his co-offenders were weaker than the applicant sought to make out.

40The applicant acknowledged several differences from the situation of his co-offenders. The applicant accepted that his position was different in that he had pleaded not guilty and was sentenced after trial. And the applicant accepted in submissions that he had a ""lengthier criminal record"" than his co-offenders. Mr Dennis had convictions for traffic offences. Ms Miller had no convictions. Finally, the applicant acknowledges that he was the ""architect of the joint criminal enterprise"".

41But it was in the circumstances in which the offence was committed and the personal situation of the applicant that he submitted there were closer similarities among the three than had been recognised on sentence. 

42The applicant submitted that the two co-offenders, Mr Dennis and Ms Miller had ""participated willingly and given great assistance in carrying out the joint criminal enterprise"". His submissions pointed out: that Ms Miller had ""driven her white Holden Commodore to the scene of the crime after stopping ... to pick up a trailer and a cordless drill""; that although the applicant had ""cut the two strands of barbed wire above the [perimeter] fence"", all three offenders together ""scaled the fence""; and that Mr Dennis ""utilizing the cordless drill, removed a number of screws securing the steel sheet panelling on the roller door and [the applicant] and Mr Dennis entered the building while Ms Miller remained outside [the building but on the premises]""; that Mr Dennis joined the applicant in passing a number of tyres out of an opening in the wire that Ms Miller had created; and finally that the three had agreed to share any proceeds of the offence equally.

43The applicant further submitted, as follows, that his subjective circumstances were similar to those of his co-offenders. Their ages were similar; indeed Mr Dennis was a little older than the other two. Each of the offenders was ""in some financial difficulty"". And the applicant ""ultimately did express remorse"", explaining at his sentencing hearing that his reasons for pleading not guilty was his desire to avoid custody, to be with his partner Ms Miller and their two children. The applicant then referred in his submissions to the other matters identified earlier in these reasons under the heading ""The Applicant's Subjective Circumstances"".

44In summary the applicant submitted that ""any real assessment of the levels of criminality of all three"" was ""very similar"" and that the co-offenders' pleas of guilty and their different criminal records are not such as ""would justify a significant difference of head sentences and non-parole periods imposed upon the applicant"". 

45But after consideration I prefer the Crown submissions in answer to the applicant's case on both parts of Ground 1 of this application for leave to appeal.

46Ground 1, Part 1 - the Crown's submissions are preferred. There are several problems with the applicant's submission that significant differences in the way that that each sentencing judge assessed the objective seriousness of the offence led to justifiable grievance as to the disparity in sentences.

47It is true that his Honour did not expressly describe the objective seriousness of the offence by reference to a place on the range above or below the midpoint. In doing so, his Honour avoided the error identified in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 of engaging in a ""two-stage approach"". What his Honour did was to recite the objective features of the offence, including all the matters considered by Judge English (see [7]-[9] above), although in different words and with a different emphasis. To the extent that it is necessary to compare the notional start points for the sentences imposed by their Honours, it is implicit from the head sentence that his Honour imposed that he concluded that the offence was well below the midrange of offences of this kind. The non parole period imposed was consistent with that assessment. Finally, those remarks on sentence were given ex tempore which should not be construed ""minutely and finally with an eye keenly attuned to the perception of error"": Warner v Regina [2013] NSWCCA 10 at [33].

48Ground 1, Part 2 - the Crown's submissions are preferred. Full consideration of the matters to which the Crown adverts leads me to conclude that in this matter the Court should refuse to intervene because the disparity in sentences between the applicant and his co-offenders ""is justified by differences between co-offenders such as age, background, criminal history, general character, and the part that each has played in the relevant criminal conduct or enterprise"": Green at [28] and Lowe at 609 per Mason J. Here such differences well justify the disparity in sentences between the applicant and his co-offenders. The differences occur here in every one of the categories the High Court considered in Green at [28] other than perhaps age.

49The part each played in the relevant criminal conduct. There are clear distinctions in the relative culpability of the applicant and his co-offenders in the commission of the offence. The applicant designed this crime. And it was implemented according to the scheme he conceived. He is the one who went around to the house of the co-offenders, presented the scheme to them, and persuaded them to join him in an enterprise for which success required several participants. He then led the criminal enterprise in an active role throughout. At the end point of the enterprise he himself took control of the valuable proceeds of the crime, directing the storage of the tyres at his own premises, presumably for their later disposal. This, on the facts, is a truer picture of the offender's relative culpability, than the rough equality in responsibility for which the applicant's submissions contend.

50Age. The applicant's age is not itself a differentiating factor between the applicant and his co-offenders. Their age differences were not significant. But their age similarity rather highlights the applicant's heightened and very effective influence over his co-offenders. As her Honour Judge English found: ""there was a degree of pressure brought to bear upon these two by [the applicant]"", pressure that was especially effective because of the ""precarious"" financial circumstances of Mr Dennis and Ms Miller.

51Background. Two background matters differentiate the applicant from his co-offenders. He was on parole (for traffic matters) at the time of the offence; they were not on parole. All three had the burden of financial difficulties. But for Mr Dennis these difficulties were compounded by an undiagnosed mental condition, with which Ms Miller had to cope as his partner, as they both sought to care for their children. The applicant had a need for treatment for his stress and depressive symptoms but one that was not quite so pressing. 

52Criminal History. The contrasting criminal histories of the applicant and his co-offenders are set out above, respectively at [11], [19] and [21]. A central difference between the minor offences committed by Mr Dennis and Ms Miller and the criminal history of the applicant was that he had two prior offences of a similar nature. On sentence for both those prior offences in 2004 and 2006 he had received bonds, the latter of which supported a suspended sentence. In substance the applicant was asking on this appeal for something similar to his 2006 sentence. But this time the circumstances called for something more severe to effect specific deterrence to the applicant. His Honour Acting Judge Puckeridge QC's sentence reflects that consideration. 

53General character. The applicant's co-offenders had the benefit of findings of good character, despite having committed minor offences. And their pleas of guilty were consistent with their good character. The applicant could not claim, and did not have, a similar finding in his favour given his record. And his propounding a false alibi during his trial, of having been at a buck's party at the time of the offences, was very recent conduct that was hardly consistent with his then good character.

54But the findings on sentence show that the co-offenders were different from (and better than) the applicant in most relevant measures of character: they had good prospects of rehabilitation - his record showed that he had previously breached the bonds into which he had entered under Crimes (Sentencing Procedures) Act ss 9 and 12; they were found to be remorseful and contrite and consistent with that had pleaded guilty leading to a 40 per cent discount on their sentences - he had no such finding, although expressing a degree of regret after a failed plea of not guilty; and finally, they were found to be highly unlikely to reoffend - on the evidence such a finding was not and could not be made for the applicant.

55The applicant's sense of grievance at the disparity in sentences here is not justified on the objective grounds that the law requires before intervention on appeal. Moreover the Crown's submission is persuasive that any reduction in the applicant's sentence would result in a sentence that ""is disproportionate to the objective and the subjective circumstances"". This ground of appeal fails. 

Ground 2 - Claim that the Sentence is Manifestly Excessive

56The applicant submits that his sentence was manifestly excessive. The Crown submits there is no basis for the Court to intervene on that ground.

57As with other discretionary judgments, the inquiry on an appeal against sentence is determined on House v R (1936) 55 CLR 499, at 504-505 (""House"") principles, by asking whether specific error is shown: an error of principle, a mistake of fact, the influence of irrelevant considerations or the failure to take material considerations into account in the decision. But to make good this ground, if specific error is not shown, the applicant must satisfy the Court that the sentence is manifestly excessive, in the well-recognised sense that it is ""unreasonable"" or ""plainly unjust"": Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357, at 370-371 (""Markarian"") and Carroll v The Queen [2009] HCA 13, 83 ALJR 579, at [8]-[9] (""Carroll""). 

58Here the appellant argues that two specific errors are demonstrated in his Honour Acting Judge Puckeridge's sentencing decision. The first is that his Honour is said not to have made any findings as to the objective seriousness of the offence. And the second is that his Honour is said not to have put sufficient weight ""on the applicant's young age and intellectual shortcomings as being involved in the offence"". 

59Neither of these arguments is persuasive. As the Crown has submitted, and I have reasoned above in relation to Ground 1, his Honour's reasons show that he did take into account the objective seriousness of the offence, despite his not making an express finding as to that matter. 

60The applicant's argument based on lack of weight on the applicant's young age and intellectual shortcomings has several problems. On its face the submission does not make a case of specific error. The argument the applicant puts is only that the sentencing judge did not put ""sufficient weight"" on these matters. The applicant does not submit that his Honour gave no weight to these matters, which is what would be required to make out a case of specific error within House principles.

61Moreover the applicant cannot put such a submission based upon his Honour's sentencing remarks. As the Crown points out, his Honour specifically has regard to Ms Wakeley's psychological report about the applicant. He records the findings of Ms Wakeley's report in detail, findings that deal thoroughly with both the applicant's youth and intellectual limitations. Moreover his Honour also records his concern that the applicant may become institutionalised. His Honour's assessment of these matters leads to his consequential findings of special circumstances. The logic of his reasoning is clear. He has taken these two matters into account.

62Nor is this a case in which, if specific error is not shown, the applicant can satisfy the Court that the sentence is manifestly excessive, in the well-recognised sense that it is ""unreasonable"" or ""plainly unjust"" within Markarian at [25] and Carroll at [8] - [9]. Crimes Act s 112(2) carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 5 years. The applicant's sentence was 3 years and 10 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 2 months.

63This sentence is not manifestly excessive in the circumstances. The applicant solicited his co-offenders and organised the execution of the offence. The offence included, as the Crown submitted, ""repeated incursions into commercial premises"". The applicant has a criminal history, which includes similar offences. Aggravating features of the offence are that the applicant was on parole at the date of offending. So the factors of personal deterrence and protection of the community assume greater significance. All these features weigh against any substantial reduction in the applicant's sentence. 

64Moreover, his Honour's findings as to the applicant's special circumstances under Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act s 44(2), allowed the substantial reduction of the non-parole period to only 57 percent of the head sentence, down from the legislative presumption of 75 percent in the absence of special circumstances.



Conclusion

65In the result therefore neither ground of appeal would be made out. I would allow the application for leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

66So the orders that I propose are: (1) application for leave to appeal under Criminal Appeal Act 1912 s 5(1)(c) allowed; (2) appeal dismissed. 

67BELLEW J: I agree with Slattery J.

		02 May 2013",2013-05-01 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2706796,R v Kaewklom (No. 4) [2013] NSWSC 504,"JUDGMENT

1JOHNSON J: This is an application, initiated by the Crown, under s.43 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 seeking to reopen sentence with respect to the Offender, Kukiat Kaewklom, for an offence under s.35(2) Crimes Act 1900 of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm. 

2On 8 February 2013, I sentenced the Offender with respect to an offence of murder and an offence under s.35(2) Crimes Act 1900: R v Kaewklom (No. 3) [2013] NSWSC 59. The circumstances in which the s.35(2) matter came to be before this Court were explained at [5]-[8] of my remarks on sentence of that day. 

3I sentenced the Offender for the s.35(2) offence to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of two years and nine months commencing on 15 February 2011 and expiring on 14 November 2013, with a balance of term of one year commencing on 15 November 2013 and expiring on 14 November 2014. 

4A sentence of imprisonment for 20 years was imposed on the murder count with a commencement date of 15 February 2013, and with a non-parole period of 13 years and six months expiring on 14 August 2026. 

5The overall effect was that a period of two years' imprisonment was solely attributable to the s.35(2) offence (being the period from 15 February 2011 to 14 February 2013). 

6On 25 March 2013, a letter was despatched by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to me, drawing attention to a problem that had been recognised with respect to the sentencing process for the s.35(2) offence. Put shortly, there had been a common understanding by the parties (and myself) at the time of sentence, that the Offender had pleaded guilty to, and been committed for sentence from the Local Court, for an offence under s.35(2). In that way, the Court proceeded in accordance with s.99ff Criminal Procedure Act 1986, upon the basis that the Offender had pleaded guilty to the s.35(2) offence in the Local Court and had been committed for sentence on that count. 

7What was discovered by the Crown after the imposition of sentence was that the Offender had, in fact, pleaded guilty to an offence under s.33(1)(b) Crimes Act 1900 of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. That offence is a more serious one with a higher maximum penalty than an offence under s.35(2). 

8I should note that neither senior counsel for the Offender, or her instructing solicitor, had appeared for the Offender in the Campbelltown Local Court, or in this Court until 8 November 2012. Nor did the Crown prosecutor, or her instructing solicitor, appear in the Local Court. As mentioned in R v Kaewklom (No. 3) at [5], the committal for sentence matter was transferred to this Court from the District Court to allow the Offender to be sentenced for the two offences at the same time. This was a sensible course in the circumstances of the case, but regrettably there was an inaccurate understanding concerning the committal for sentence matter.

9There is a common submission from the Crown and senior counsel for the Offender, that what occurred on 8 February 2013 involved the imposition of a penalty that was contrary to law. 

10Section 43 permits the sentencing Court, or a Judge of the sentencing Court, to reopen the question of sentence if there has been a sentence imposed that was contrary to law. There is no need on this application to expand upon the construction and operation of s.43. I am well satisfied, as counsel on both sides of the record submit, that the course which occurred on 8 February 2013 involved the imposition of a penalty that was contrary to law. It was not open to the Court to sentence the Offender for an offence to which he had not pleaded guilty, and been committed for sentence.

11Accordingly, at the hearing of the application today, I directed that the question of sentence on the s.35(2) offence be reopened. I made an order setting aside the sentence which I imposed which, as I have said, was contrary to law. 
 
12Section 43(2) provides that the Court may reopen the proceedings and, after giving the parties an opportunity to be heard, impose a penalty that is in accordance with the law, and if necessary, amend any relevant conviction or order. 

13The procedure which has been adopted to allow the Court to proceed to finality with respect to this matter today, has involved the presentation of an indictment containing two counts; Count 1 being a charge under s. 33(1)(b) Crimes Act 1900; Count 2 being an alternative count under s.35(2) of the Act. 

14The common position of the parties was that the appropriate and fair way to proceed was for the Offender to enter pleas to the two counts, with the expectation that he would plead not guilty to the first count and guilty to the alternative second count, with the Crown indicating an acceptance of that plea in full discharge of the indictment. That is, in fact, what occurred. 

15Thus, by a pathway that is not affected by legal error, this Court is now able to impose a penalty that is in accordance with the law. I have already set aside the legally flawed sentence which I passed on 8 February 2013. I have heard the parties on the question of what sentence ought now be imposed upon the Offender. 

16I acknowledge that the approach adopted has a benefit for the Offender, in that he is to be sentenced today for an offence which is of lesser gravity than that to which he had pleaded guilty initially in the Local Court. However, the fact is that the position which occurred at the sentencing hearing before me, leading to sentence being passed on 8 February 2013, involved a common and mistaken acceptance that that was the offence for which he should be sentenced. The Crown position on this application is, in my view, both fair and reasonable. 
 
17I also take into account the fact that, as my remarks on sentence made clear (at [83]-[87], [126], [139]-[140]), the Offender was being sentenced as a young man for two serious offences for which, in the end, a total effective non-parole period of 15 years and six months was imposed.

18The s.35(2) offence for which the Offender was sentenced on 8 February 2013, and for which I am now asked to sentence him again, was and remains a serious offence. I am satisfied, however, in the exercise of the Court's discretion under s.43, that the approach which I am asked to take is the appropriate one in all the circumstances. 

19The common submission again is that the appropriate course is to impose the sentence which was imposed (albeit on a flawed basis) for this offence on 8 February 2013. The Crown does not submit that any different sentence ought be imposed, and senior counsel for the Offender likewise does not submit that there ought be any alteration to the sentence, or to the level of accumulation which was ordered. 

20I am satisfied that it is appropriate in the circumstances to impose the sentence of imprisonment which was imposed on 8 February 2013 for this offence. That course will mean that the sentences imposed upon the Offender on 8 February 2013 will remain the same in duration and combination, but with those sentences not being affected by legal error.

21Accordingly, the Offender is convicted of the offence of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm to X, committed on 10 February 2011. For the crime of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm to X, I sentence the Offender to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of two years and nine months commencing on 15 February 2011 and expiring on 14 November 2013, with a balance of term of one year commencing on 15 November 2013 and expiring on 14 November 2014. 

22I note that the sentence of imprisonment on the murder count remains as imposed on 8 February 2013. 

23Accordingly as a result of the sentence imposed today (in conjunction with the sentence for murder), the earliest date upon which the Offender will be eligible for release to parole remains 15 August 2026.

		23 May 2013",2013-05-02 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2706798,R v Smith [2013] NSWSC 796,"SENTENCE

1The offender, Robert Smith, pleaded guilty in the Local Court on 16 December 2011 to the manslaughter of his de facto partner's six year old daughter by way of gross criminal negligence and to being an accessory after the fact to her murder. Those pleas were confirmed on arraignment in this Court on 3 February 2012.

2The manslaughter was committed on 13 July 2010, while the accessorial offence was committed between 13 July 2010 and 21 April 2011. Each offence carries a maximum penalty of 25 years' imprisonment. 

3The offender is to be sentenced on the basis of the following agreed facts.

The Offences

4The offender, who is now 34 years of age, commenced a relationship with Kristi Abrahams in 2006. Ms Abrahams had a daughter, the deceased, who was born on 22 April 2004 during her relationship with her former partner. That relationship ended following an assault by Ms Abrahams on the deceased on 3 July 2005. The child's father reported the assault to the police. Ms Abrahams was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm, was convicted of that offence on 1 May 2006 in the Local Court and released on a section 9 bond for a period of 12 months.

5The deceased was placed into foster care for a period of 18 months. Ms Abrahams was directed to enter into a parental care plan and to attend anger management and counselling programs. Ms Abrahams was allowed supervised access to the deceased.

6The deceased was restored to Ms Abrahams' custody on 23 December 2006. At that time, Ms Abrahams and the offender rented premises in Mt Druitt, being a two-bedroom unit on the first floor. The offender adopted the role of father to the deceased and thought of himself as her father. The offender and Ms Abrahams subsequently had two children together, one born on 9 February 2008 and another born 7 July 2010. The deceased occupied one bedroom of the unit while Ms Abrahams and the offender shared the second bedroom with the other two children.

7At about 9:30am on 1 August 2010, Ms Abrahams called 000 and reported the deceased missing from her bedroom and the front door of the unit open. She told police that the offender was searching for the missing child. Police undertook a large-scale search and investigation but the deceased could not be found.

8Ms Abrahams and the offender were interviewed by police on two occasions, namely in August and September 2010. They each gave false accounts of the deceased's disappearance. Both of them maintained that the offender bought dinner from Westfield shopping centre at Mt Druitt on Saturday, 31 July 2010. It was said that the family ate dinner and watched a movie, namely ""The Golden Compass"" on Channel 9. They maintained that they put the deceased to bed at about 9:30 pm. Ms Abrahams said that she fed the baby and took him to bed at about 11 pm. The offender joined her shortly thereafter.

9They further maintained that they woke up during the night to feed the baby. The offender said that he had prepared a bottle of milk whereas Ms Abrahams claimed that she breastfed the baby. Ms Abrahams maintained that she discovered the deceased missing from her bedroom at about 9:30 am as she was returning from the toilet. She claimed that she woke the offender to look for the deceased while she rang 000. The offender told police that he was yelling out the deceased's name throughout the neighbourhood, although none of the neighbours heard or saw anything consistent with the offender's version of events.

10CCTV footage of the neighbourhood on 1 August 2010 depicts the offender casually walking through Westfield shopping centre at Mt Druitt at about 10:40 am. Thereafter, neither the offender nor Ms Abrahams assisted police in any further searches.

11The offender claimed in the course of his interview that the deceased was a normal happy child and that Ms Abrahams' parenting was in no way inappropriate. The offender said that Ms Abrahams did no more than administer ""a little smack"" to the deceased if she had misbehaved. He described the relationship between Ms Abrahams and the deceased as ""good"" and denied that he or Ms Abrahams would do anything to harm the child.

12The investigation generated a significant amount of national media interest. Initially the offender and Ms Abrahams refused to speak with the media. However, on 3 August 2010 they made their first television appearance outside Mt Druitt police station. The offender spoke on Ms Abrahams behalf and asked for anyone who knew anything to come forward and contact the police. The offender expressed the hope that the deceased was found as soon as possible and that she was safe and well. He said that it was more difficult to cope with her disappearance the longer she was missing and that he had no idea who might have taken the child.

13The offender and Ms Abrahams took part in a number of media interviews including an article published in ""Who"" magazine. The offender made a number of comments in the course of that article, namely that he looked everywhere for the child, that it was difficult dealing with the media reports because ""you couldn't do anything to harm your daughter in that way"", that he had nothing to hide and that if he knew where the child was he would not be sitting in the interview room.

14On 6 August 2010 in an ABC media interview the offender said that the police had identified him as a key suspect. He said that ""there is no way in the world"" that he would cause harm to the child. The following day in a Daily Telegraph interview, the offender again denied having anything to do with the child's disappearance.

15The versions provided by the offender and Ms Abrahams relating to the disappearance of the child were repeated to a number of DOCS officers after August 2010. 

16Both of the offender's and Ms Abrahams' children were removed from their care on 20 April 2011 as a result of a number of developments in the investigation of the deceased's disappearance. These developments included the detection of the presence of the deceased's blood throughout the unit and the availability of evidence from witnesses who saw bruising and injuries on the deceased while she was in the offender's and Ms Abrahams' care.

17As a result of a covert police operation that included recorded conversations between an undercover operative and the offender, telephone intercepts, surveillance and listening devices, it became apparent on 21 April 2011 that the child received an injury in the evening of 13 July 2010 that resulted in a loss of consciousness. It will be the Crown case in a forthcoming trial against Ms Abrahams that Ms Abrahams was responsible for that injury. 

18The offender's account to the undercover operative was that he was changing the nappy of one of the other children in the lounge room while Ms Abrahams and the deceased were in the deceased's bedroom. He said that he heard ""a loud bang"" coming from the deceased's bedroom. He entered the bedroom and saw the child lying on the bedroom floor, breathing but unconscious.

19The offender said that he panicked and did not know what to do. He said that he was trying to wake the child but was unsuccessful. He said that the child was still breathing at this stage and that he tried everything for ""half the night"" but the child would not wake. Ms Abrahams placed the child in bed and the offender and Ms Abrahams retired for the night.

20The next morning, the offender went to work. When he came home the child was dead. Ms Abrahams was still with the child at home. Later that day, Ms Abrahams and the offender took a suitcase from the garage, placed the child's body in the suitcase and placed the suitcase in the child's bedroom.

21The body remained in the suitcase in the bedroom for a number of days while they decided how they were to dispose of the body. The offender rode his bicycle to nearby bushland to locate a suitable burial site. When he had done so, he dug a shallow grave with a hammer which he subsequently cleaned and threw away. The bicycle was also cleaned to remove any traces of the grave site.

22At about 5:30 am on Sunday, 18 July 2010, the offender called a taxi and told the operator to collect them from a false address. The offender also provided to the operator a false address as the destination. However, when the taxi arrived the offender corrected that destination and placed the suitcase containing the child's body into the boot of the taxi. Both Ms Abrahams and the offender disguised their appearance for the purposes of this journey.

23The taxi travelled to Freya Crescent, Shalvey where Ms Abrahams and the offender, who was carrying the suitcase, got out of the taxi and walked for approximately 30 minutes along a number of fire trails to the grave site that had previously been prepared by the offender. The grave site was marked with a pouch which the offender had found nearby. It is suggested that the object was placed on top of the grave by the offender in order to deflect investigators in the event that the grave site was found.

24The child's body was placed in the grave and the offender poured a bottle of petrol onto the body which he ignited. He threw the bottle into the fire and filled in the grave. The suitcase was carried a short distance away and set on fire.

25The offender and Ms Abrahams remained in the area for about an hour. They left together in a taxi at about 7 am from Sedgman Crescent Shalvey. They were driven back to the vicinity of the unit.

26The offender returned to the grave site alone a couple of days later to ensure that the suitcase was fully burnt. He threw the wire frame of the suitcase into the bush.

27The offender and Ms Abrahams threw out the shoes and clothing that they were wearing when they buried the deceased's body and destroyed their mobile telephone sim cards. However, police retrieved deleted SMS text messages from the offender's phone and from Ms Abrahams' phone. Those text messages included one between Ms Abrahams and the offender on 23 July 2010 wherein Ms Abrahams asked the offender if he still loved her. The offender replied : ""U need to remember what I said.""

28On 28 July 2010, Ms Abrahams purchased items purportedly intended for the deceased, including a Tinkerbell poster and some toys.

29After giving this account to the undercover operative, the offender and Ms Abrahams took the undercover operative to the deceased's grave site in the expectation that he would assist them in removing and disposing of the deceased's remains to avoid any implication in her death. Ms Abrahams and the offender were arrested at the grave site on 22 April 2011. Police found the deceased's remains in a shallow grave. The remains were taken to the Glebe morgue where a post mortem was carried out.

30The results of the post mortem confirmed that the deceased was the victim of long-term physical abuse leading up to the night of the injury. There were several sharp edged fractures to the teeth, indicative of a recent injury, possibly sustained by forcible closure of the mouth during a blow to the head or a similar trauma. Several bony injuries suggested repeated assaults over the weeks and months prior to the deceased's death. These injuries were generally only found in the remains of children who suffered from ""severe physical abuse"". The condition of the body precluded a finding as to the cause of death.

31A specialist odontologist reported that the fracturing of the teeth appeared to be recent and consistent with trauma during life rather than post mortem. The pattern of distribution of the fractures was said to be consistent with the lower teeth being forced up against the upper teeth. The type and degree of force required to cause such fracturing of the enamel was said to be consistent with a contact sport blow or from jumping from a height and landing heavily on the ground. There were indications from the remains that the body had been disturbed by scavengers such as a dog or fox.

The Objective Gravity of the Offences

32The manslaughter offence is based upon the duty of care owed by the offender towards the deceased as her stepfather and, by his own admission, as a parent. The offender breached that duty of care by failing to seek medical treatment at the time of the incident on the evening of 13 July or immediately thereafter, knowing that the deceased had suffered a significant injury. The offender failed to seek medical treatment for the child at any time. His failure to seek that treatment and his complete disregard for the welfare of the child, evidenced in particular by his decision to go to work on the morning following the injury, constitutes gross criminal negligence of a very high order.

33There are several factors relevant to the objective gravity of this offence. The offender came into the life of the deceased when she was two and a half years of age. The circumstances surrounding the restoration of the deceased to Ms Abrahams in December 2006 brought to the attention of the offender the circumstances under which she had previously been removed from Ms Abrahams' care. The post mortem provides cogent evidence to the effect that the deceased was repeatedly injured over the weeks and months prior to her death. That conclusion is also reinforced by the evidence of witnesses from the neighbourhood who observed bruising to the deceased during her short life. 

34These factors establish to my satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was aware of his partner's physical abuse of the deceased for some period of time before 13 July 2010. It is against this background that the offender's failure to seek medical attention for the child immediately after he became aware that she was unconscious, or on the following day, ought be assessed. Notwithstanding the offender's claim that he was not aware of the precise nature of the injury to the deceased on the evening of 13 July 2010, a loss of consciousness in a six-year-old child, whose physical condition was already compromised by repeated trauma, would move all but the most callous and unfeeling of adults to seek out urgent medical attention, let alone one who claimed that he regarded the deceased as a daughter.

35I reject out of hand any suggestion that the offender was so overborne or intimidated by Ms Abrahams that his judgment was compromised against acting in the child's interests. This is a subject to which I will return when discussing the offender's subjective circumstances. I acknowledge that Ms Abrahams appeared to be the dominant partner in the relationship, and that she was violent towards him, according to the offender, as well as towards their children. However, the offender is a mature male who was gainfully employed, of average intelligence, with no relevant drug or alcohol issues while he was in the relationship, and was acutely aware of the deceased's vulnerability. He made a simple and cowardly choice that favoured his relationship with Ms Abrahams over the needs of a gravely injured child. I n other words, he acted more out of loyalty to Ms Abrahams than out of fear of reprisal from her for calling for medical assistance.

36The offender stands to be sentenced on the basis of his failure to act, not on the basis that his conduct injured the deceased and thereby lead to her death. Nonetheless, in circumstances where this helpless and vulnerable child depended for survival as much on the person who stood by and did nothing, as upon the person who assaulted her, it is a rather fine distinction. 

37In my view, this offence stands towards the top of the range of objective seriousness comprehended by this species of manslaughter. By ""species of manslaughter"", I mean to refer to gross criminal negligence manslaughter.

38The objective gravity of the offence of accessory after the fact to murder falls to be assessed by reference to the conduct of the offender between 13 July 2010 and 21 April 2011. That conduct included :-
(i)Planning and carrying out the acts relating to the disposal of the deceased's body, including placing the body in the suitcase, locating a grave site, preparing the grave, carrying the body in the suitcase to the grave, burning the body, and destroying evidence from the grave site.

(ii)Destroying and removing evidence capable of implicating him and Ms Abrahams in the offence, including destroying the clothing and shoes worn for the purposes of disposing of the deceased's body, providing false information for the purposes of the taxi journeys to and from the offender's home and the destruction of mobile phone sim cards.

(iii)Providing a series of ongoing false accounts to police regarding the deceased's disappearance.

(iv)Providing a series of ongoing false accounts to media outlets and to DOCS designed to direct attention away from himself and Ms Abrahams and to implicate unknown persons in the child's disappearance.

39The offender's assistance to Ms Abrahams in an attempt to prevent her arrest and prosecution for the murder of her own child was extensive, lengthy and potentially effective. The offender assumed the primary role in the disposal and destruction of the deceased's body, the destruction of evidence and in the maintenance of a false account to the authorities and to the public at large. The act of burning the body was particularly heinous, given the difficulty of ascertaining a definitive cause of death at post mortem. 

40It is pertinent to reflect upon the offender's determined and sustained course of conduct over a period of nine months following the death of the child. Within two days of her death, the offender assiduously applied himself to the execution of a plan which was designed to destroy any evidence linking Ms Abrahams to that event, the centrepiece of which was the implied allegation that an unknown person was responsible for the child's disappearance. The offender persisted in playing the role of distraught parent, not just for the purposes of the police investigation but also for the media, all the while knowing what he had done. These were not spontaneous, ill-considered acts carried out in panic such as are usually encountered by the courts when dealing with this offence in the context of a relationship. 

41I accept the Crown's submission that this offence is in the ""worst case"" category. I am unaware of any case of accessory after the fact to murder that approximates the objective gravity of this offence. Moreover, it is difficult to envisage what more the offender could have done, that might further elevate the objective criminality. 

42It is important to recognise that the commission of this offence stands apart from the manslaughter offence. There is very little overlap between the criminality inherent in each offence. Moreover, in my view the objective gravity of the accessorial offence is greater than that of the manslaughter. 

The Offender's Subjective Circumstances

43At the time of the offences the offender was 31 years of age. His criminal history consists of summary property offences and motor vehicle offences for which the offender largely received fines, community service orders and bonds. In June 2002 the offender was sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment with a nine-month non-parole period in respect of an offence of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with intent.

44The only material provided on the offender's behalf on sentence was a report from a clinical and forensic psychologist, Dr Mark Milic, dated 10 December 2012 and a report by a consultant forensic psychiatrist, Dr Richard Furst, dated 8 February 2013.

45The following history provided by the offender to both of the authors of these reports was not confirmed by evidence from the offender.

46The offender is the middle child of three boys whose parents separated when he was 15 years of age. His mother formed a new relationship when the offender was approximately 16 years of age. His mother's partner treated him well and he came to regard him as a father figure.

47The offender received an uneventful education and described himself as a mediocre student. However, he did well in agriculture and in design and technology. He completed his Higher School Certificate. He complained of some bullying at school. 

48On leaving school he worked briefly as a cashier in a supermarket. There followed a lengthy period of unemployment during which he drank to excess and felt depressed. He worked as a store person from 2004 up to his arrest. He described that work as enjoyable, although he worked long hours because of amalgamated workshifts and overtime. He was appointed to the position of leading hand, taught to use the computerised order management system and told that he was regarded sufficiently well to become a supervisor. The company moved to Penrith, which increased the offender's travel time and contributed to a general lack of sleep. In 2009 he received a redundancy package. One month later he was employed by Woolworths in a liquor warehouse.

49The various psychological and psychiatric assessments of the offender indicate that he has an immature and passive personality style with limited capacity for self reflection. He is presently diagnosed with depression, low self-esteem and high levels of ambivalence and avoidance. The offender's description of his adolescence and early adulthood was said to be consistent with a chronic low mood, low self-esteem and a lack of self confidence.

50Dr Furst was specifically asked whether there were any symptoms or conditions currently present that are related to the offences. Dr Furst suggests that the offender's passive personality style, low self-esteem and the trauma associated with regular abuse in his relationship created a type of ""learned helplessness"" and high levels of anxiety, which prevented him from leaving Ms Abrahams. Dr Furst goes on to say that the offender's failure to seek help for the child :- 
may well have been caused by his fear of how Ms Abrahams would react, including a fear of his partner becoming violent towards him. Although this may help explain his initial failure to act, he continued to lie to police and other authorities after the offence in question and his efforts to conceal the offence were probably calculated and deliberate.

51The first qualification to this opinion concerns the extent to which the Court can rely upon untested assertions by the offender that he was regularly subject to physical abuse by Ms Abrahams in the course of the relationship. The offender described the abuse taking place on a weekly basis, and as many as three times per week. To Dr Milic, the offender maintained that there were occasions when there would be two months between arguments. 

52He describes periods of tension within the relationship which would culminate in Ms Abrahams throwing household items at the offender, such as photo frames. He claimed to Dr Milic that he had suffered a number of black eyes after being punched by Ms Abrahams. He referred to Ms Abrahams' habit of locking the front door so that he could not escape when their arguments began. On one occasion, the offender claimed that he was so desperate to escape an argument with Ms Abrahams that he jumped from the balcony of their first-floor unit. The offender claimed that he sustained severe injuries to his feet and that he was on crutches for two to three weeks. On another occasion, Ms Abrahams confronted the offender with a knife and accidentally cut him above the left elbow. The offender maintained that there were occasions when he left home to stay with his mother, although he always returned. In this regard, I note that Dr Milic interviewed the offender's mother, yet there was no reference by her to occasions when the offender came to stay at her home. 

53None of this history was even hinted at in the course of the conversations with the undercover operative, nor did the offender indicate at any time that he was unhappy in the relationship. To the contrary, he told the undercover operative that he was going to ""stick by"" Ms Abrahams. These were all unguarded conversations.

54The second qualification is that, despite Dr Furst's link between the alleged violence in the relationship and the offender's failure to seek medical help, Dr Furst himself acknowledges that the subsequent course of conduct by the offender was probably calculated and deliberate. With due respect to Dr Furst, the facts that I have related above establish that the offender's conduct was certainly calculated and deliberate.

55In the absence of evidence confirmatory of the offender's account of the extent of Ms Abrahams' violence towards him, I am prepared to accept that Ms Abrahams was volatile, argumentative, domineering and verbally abusive towards the offender, and that on occasions she threw objects and broke household items. However, I do not accept that her physical violence towards him was as frequent or as serious as the offender has described to the respective doctors. I do not accept that there was anything so dire about the offender's circumstances, that his moral culpability for either offence is reduced.

56I accept that he requires treatment for depression in the prison system, but that is as much a product of his incarceration for these offences as it is his pre-existing condition. He will likely spend a significant portion of his sentence in protective custody, so that some modest allowance ought be made for the additional deprivations he will thereby suffer. 

Other Considerations

57The nature of these offences calls for some emphasis to be given to the principle of general deterrence in the sentencing exercise. It is important that the sentence reflects the seriousness with which the law regards a breach of parental duties and responsibilities with respect to the welfare of a young child entrusted to the offender's care. It is also vital that the sentence for the accessorial offence conveys the gravity of the offender's conduct in assisting Ms Abrahams to escape liability for her role in the death of the child. The retributive aspect of this sentencing exercise is also prominent. 

58Specific deterrence has lesser weight in the light of the relatively minor nature of the offender's criminal history. However, given that the offences were committed in the context of a relationship, there remain some concerns that the offender's appreciation of parenting responsibilities is secondary to his own emotional needs. His expressions of remorse to the psychologist and psychiatrist centred on his failure to help the deceased, and to a lesser extent on his maintenance of the lies told to police and the media. His primary concern with respect to telling the police the truth was the consequences to himself, that is, Ms Abrahams' likely reaction. These factors reinforce the conclusion that the offender is immature and lacking in insight. In those circumstances his remorse is significantly qualified. 

59His prospects of rehabilitation are reasonably sound, provided he develops further insight into his offending conduct. The offender is entitled to a discount of 25% for the early plea of guilty. 

60Taking into account the above objective and subjective factors, I would impose a head sentence of seven years for the manslaughter offence and a head sentence of twelve years for the accessorial offence. Despite the fact that there is little overlap in the criminality inherent in each offence, there are considerations of totality at play. The offender has not previously served a lengthy prison term, he is still a relatively young man and a complete absence of concurrency would give rise to a disproportionate sentence. Accordingly, there ought be a measure of partial concurrency.

61I do not consider that a finding of special circumstances is warranted. I have taken the offender's custodial conditions into account in fixing the appropriate head sentence and any lesser non-parole period than that prescribed by the legislature would fail in my view to adequately reflect the offender's criminality. The balance of the aggregate term will in any event provide the offender with sufficient time to address his reintegration into the community.

62Robert Smith, you are convicted of the offence of manslaughter. I sentence you to a fixed term of seven (7) years to date from 22 April 2011 and to expire on 21 April 2018. 

63You are convicted of the offence of accessory after the fact to murder. I sentence you to a non-parole period of nine (9) years to date from 22 April 2014, to expire 21 April 2023. I fix a balance of term of four (4) years to expire 21 April 2027. 

64The aggregate sentence is one of sixteen (16) years with a non-parole period of twelve (12) years. You are eligible for release on 22 April 2023.

		30 July 2013",2013-05-02 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2706837,R v Gowans [2013] NSWDC 284,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: The ultimate purpose of sentencing is to protect the community. Sometimes, indeed usually, Judges hope to achieve that objective by imposing upon offenders sentences which will deter, not only them, but others who might be tempted to offend in a like manner. But sometimes the protection of a community is best achieved by promoting an offender's rehabilitation. The idea is that if a sentence can be fashioned which sees an offender move away from a life of crime, then the result that that individual will commit no further offences achieves a great benefit to the community.

2When Miss Gowans first appeared before me on 9 August last year there were suggestions, which I accepted, that in her case the protection of the community was best served by allowing her to demonstrate to me that she was capable of rehabilitating herself. I therefore allowed her bail under s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. She went to a residential rehabilitation program but she broke the rules of the program and was excluded. 

3She lived with her mother for awhile, but then came back before me because it was a condition of bail that she go to that residential rehabilitation program.  I was persuaded to continue to allow Miss Gowans to have the opportunity of demonstrating to me that she could rehabilitate herself and so she went to a different residential rehabilitation program. Any hope that something positive and significant might be achieved was dashed on 24 November 2012 where Miss Gowans, after an argument she says with her boyfriend, took drugs and committed a whole series of offences for which she must now be sentenced.

4Miss Gowans is a person who has spent a great deal of her adult life in custody because she continually breaks the law. She has demonstrated a continuing attitude of disobedience to the law. When she took the Xanax on 24 November 2012 she had been under no illusions about what would happen to her if she committed offences whilst under the influence of drugs and of course she well knew of her propensity to do precisely that, to commit offences whilst under the influence of drugs. 

5She is an adult woman and although her background which I will discuss in a little while is such that the decision as to whether she would take drugs on 24 November was made on a background of drug addiction and a lack of a proper parental supervision, the fact remains that ultimately Miss Gowans has to take responsibility for her own decisions and it was her decision to take the drugs after the argument with her boyfriend which has led to her facing a further lengthy period of gaol.

6The initial offence that Miss Gowans committed and which first brought her before me was an offence of aggravated enter a dwelling with intent to commit larceny knowing there was a person inside. She was on parole at the time of that offence and I set out the circumstances of the offence in my remarks on sentence delivered on 9 August 2012. I will briefly repeat what I said.

7On 15 December 2011 she entered into a home where a person was working at the time. He heard the offender's footsteps and approached her. She was clearly intending to steal from him but she said that she merely wanted to use the bathroom. She went into the bathroom and when the victim tried to prevent her leaving, she began yelling and screaming alleging that he had raped her. She then picked up a knife which the victim had been using to open mail and waived it around threatening that she would kill the victim. Eventually she ran out of the door.

8The victim contacted police, coincidentally she had been seen running away from the scene by other police and she was arrested soon afterwards. She pleaded guilty at an early stage and so the sentence ultimately imposed upon her will be twenty-five per cent less than it would otherwise have been.

9There are many similarities between the conduct that Miss Gowans displayed on that occasion whilst under the influence of drug with her conduct on 24 November last year. She faced a sentence for six separate matters and when I sentence her for one of those there are two other matters on a Form 1 to be taken into account. All these offences occurred over a very short period of time in the same location whilst Miss Gowans was under the influence of drugs to such an extent that she says she has no recollection of them.

10The first offence is an offence for break, enter and steal. This was about 8.20 on that evening which was a Saturday night when the first victim a Mr Patrick arrived home. When he drove into the driveway he realised that things were amiss, in particular there were lights on inside and the rear door to his house was open. So he got out of the car and ran into the back door, as he did this he heard his front door slam. He peered into his house and saw that his house and belongings appear to have been ransacked. He checked that there was no-one left inside the house and rang the police.

11It appears that about five minutes before Mr Patrick got home the offender had gone into his home, ransacked the place and taken some material from it. Photographs were tendered of the state of Mr Patrick's house. It is obvious that Miss Gowans cares nothing, at least under the influence of drugs, for other people's property rights. All she cares about, whilst under the influence of drugs, is getting money or getting goods so that she can sell them for money so that she can get more drugs.

12After Miss Gowans had been discovered by Mr Patrick committing this offence, she walked a very short distance, only three houses in fact, and went into the backyard of some premises occupied by a Mr Xang and his wife Miss Han. Their children were there as well. I am to sentence Miss Gowans on the basis that she did not realise that there was anyone at home when she went into the home and stole a number of items, in particular Mr Xang's wallet, his mobile phone and his carkeys as well as Miss Han's handbag. That is an offence of break, enter and steal. She used the car keys to go to the car in the driveway and stole a GPS unit from it.

13The next offence is on a Form 1. A few houses away Miss Gowans removed the flyscreen to the bathroom of those premises but was not able to enter the premises or take any property within. Undeterred she went to the house next door. This time she cut the flyscreen on the bathroom window and stole property consisting a toiletries bag and a bottle of cologne. So there is an offence there of damaging property which appears on the Form 1 and stealing from a dwelling for which Miss Gowans must be specifically sentenced.

14She then went to other premises, this time a unit block. One of the residents, a Miss Jospavich, had left her keys in the front door of her unit. The offender took those keys and in the process locked Miss Jospavich and her daughter inside. Miss Jospavich heard the lock operate and so she got out of her unit through the garage. There she saw Miss Gowans crouched on the stairs. She was holding her son's Nike shoes. When she confronted Miss Gowans about this she was abused a number of times before eventually Miss Gowans threw her keys at her and walked away.

15That is the offence of stealing from a dwelling which has the Form 1 matters attached to it.

16The final offence involved Ms Gowans climbing over a fence, taking a flyscreen from a window and going to the front door trying to get in. Someone was home. That person heard the front door rattling. He got up and looked through the glass on the front door. He saw Ms Gowans looking through from the other direction. He opened his front door and saw Ms Gowans walk away. The householder then went to a nearby location where he found a number of items, some of which were the proceeds of the offence involving Mr Xang which I mentioned earlier.

17The police, who had been called of course by Mr Patrick, stopped Ms Gowans on Pemberton Street at about 9.40pm. The first of her offences was said to have been about 8.15pm. When Ms Gowans was stopped, she had a large number of items representing the proceeds of some of her offences.

18Ms Gowans has through her decisions caused a great deal of harm, not only in the past but also in relation to the offences for which I must sentence her. A large number of people have suffered, not necessarily financially but much more likely psychologically because of what Ms Gowans has done. I fully acknowledge that it was my decision to release her on a s 11 remand which has enabled her to commit the offences of 24 November 2012. Ms Gowans pleaded guilty at an early opportunity to those offences and so the sentences for those will be twenty five per cent less than they would otherwise have been.

19I said I would speak about Ms Gowans background. It is not a happy one. It was described as ""chaotic"" and having read various descriptions of it, that is probably a fairly accurate description. Ms Gowans was raised in the Redfern area. Two particular issues in her home were drug use by her mother and violence by her father. Her parents split up because of her father's violence. Having been exposed to her mother's drug use from a young age it is perhaps not surprising to find that Ms Gowans herself began using drugs at a young age as well. She started using pot and alcohol at fourteen and heroin shortly thereafter. It was of course after that she started getting into trouble with the police, something which has occurred regularly over the years.

20There have been periods, and one in particular, of abstinence by Ms Gowans. She was able to give up drugs for seven months after her son was born but DOCS became involved in relation to her son's care and after orders taking her son away from her were made final she relapsed. From time to time she has made efforts to rehabilitate herself and indeed a great deal of assistance has been provided to her. Ultimately as these facts demonstrate, the only person who can decide to rehabilitate herself is the offender. There is frankly not much more that can be done by others. I have rarely seen an offender given so many opportunities. She obviously impresses as a person who should be able to give up drugs but regrettably her history demonstrates that she does not.

21Ms Gowans is probably under no illusions what must happen to her today. I made it clear when I first put her on a s 11 remand that a failure to take advantage of the opportunities offered to her would see her spending most of her life in jail. One day, and I hope it is soon, Ms Gowans will realise the futility of the life she has been leading and make the decision (because it is her decision to make) that she will not take drugs. Until she makes that decision the unfortunate consequence is this; She will be released from jail; She will be supervised; She will be given opportunities to rehabilitate; but she will take drugs; and she will go back to jail as a direct result.

22In formulating the appropriate sentence to impose upon Ms Gowans, I have taken into account significantly her background. It fits the sort of background where the principles to be found in R v Fernando [1999] NSWCCA 66 are of direct application. Her decision to take drugs, her decision to commit crimes and the difficulty that she has giving up drugs have to be looked at in the light of the background to which she was exposed as she was growing up. I take into also very much in her favour that although there are a number of offences for which Ms Gowans must be sentenced, committed on 24 November last year, it was one quite discrete period of offending. That is not to say that everything was rosy up until that day but she committed no other offences whilst on the s 11 remand apart from those that I have outlined. Of course it could well be argued that her period of offending only came to an end because she was arrested by police. It is I suppose a matter of pure speculation as to what would have happened on the 25th or 26 November if Ms Gowans had not been arrested.

23The psychological report speaks of Ms Gowans' depression. It is well documented. That means that I will impose upon her a sentence which places less emphasis on general deterrence than would otherwise be the case. And in addition the custodial sentence that must imposed will weigh more heavily upon her.

24There was some discussion of course in submissions as the appropriate date on which to start any sentence imposed upon Ms Gowans. For reasons which I exposed during those discussions I will start the sentence on 24 March 2012. The Crown accurately pointed out some matters which might suggest that parole was revoked for a reason other than committing the offence of 15 December 2011 but matters are a bit unclear and I have to be very careful not to double count by regarding the fact that Ms Gowans was on parole as an aggravating circumstance and selecting a commencement date for a sentence which would see her double punished for the same factor.

25I have decided to impose an aggregate sentence. Had I not done so, there would have been partial accumulation of all the sentences except that I probably would have imposed concurrent sentences for some of the matters committed on 24 November. To have failed to do so would have led to the situation where the sentences would have exceeded those appropriate by application of the totality principle. 

26Were I not to impose aggregate sentences I would have imposed the following sentences, for the offence of 15 December 2011, imprisonment for three years. For sequences 1 and 2 on 24 November 2012 I would have imposed three years. For what is described as offence 4 on the Crown's coversheet and offence 6 I would have imposed imprisonment for two and a half years taking into account the Form 1 matters on offence numbered 4 and for what are described as offences 3 and 5 on the Crown's set of summary for 24 November 2012, I would have imposed imprisonment for two years.

27The aggregate sentence I impose consists of a non-parole period of three years to date from 24 March 2012 and a head sentence of five years. Ms Gowans is eligible to be released to parole on 23 March 2015.

		21 February 2014",2013-04-25 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2706848,R v SAKOVITS; R v SAKOVITS [2013] NSWSC 464,"Judgment

1HALL J: On 21 February 2013 following a trial by jury, Jane Maria Sakovits and Ronald Rudolph Sakovits were each found guilty of the following offences.

(1) That the offenders between 1 April 2001 and about 23 May 2001 at Sydney, New South Wales, did conspire with each other to defraud the Commonwealth

contrary to sections 29D and 86(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) and

(2) That the offenders between 24 May 2001 and 30 September 2006 at Sydney, New South Wales, did conspire with each party with the intention of dishonestly causing a loss to a third person, namely the Commonwealth

contrary to section 135.4(3) of the Criminal Code.

2The offenders were charged with two offences by reason of a change in the Commonwealth criminal legislation effected on 24 May 2001. For a more detailed explanation see Agius v R [2011] NSWCCA 119. The Crown, however, submitted that, notwithstanding that there were offences under different statutory regimes, there was one single conspiracy spanning the period of both charges brought against each of them. 

3The maximum penalty for an offence under to s 29D and 86(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), is a fine not exceeding 2000 penalty units, or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 20 years, or both.

4The maximum penalty for an offence contrary to s 134.5(3) of the Criminal Code is 10 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $66,000.

5The Crown has submitted that, for the purposes of sentencing, the maximum penalty should be regarded as 10 years in respect of count 1: R v Boughen; R v Cameron [2012] NSWCCA 17 at [3].

6In determining the sentences in the case of each offender, I am required to make findings for the purpose of determining the sentences to be imposed. In determining the facts my determination must be consistent with the verdicts of the jury and findings of fact that I make against each offender must be arrived at beyond reasonable doubt: Cheung v R [2001] HCA 67; 209 CLR 1 at 12-13, [13]-[14]. 

7A sentencing court may not take facts into account on sentence in a way that is adverse to the interests of either offender unless those facts have been established beyond reasonable doubt. On the other hand if there are matters which one or other or both of the offenders rely upon in mitigation of penalty, it is sufficient if those matters are proved by the offender or offenders on the balance of probabilities: R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270 at 281 [27]-[28].

8At trial in the present proceedings a significant volume of documentary material was admitted into evidence. The trial was conducted by the Crown and by the offenders through Senior Counsel in a co-operative and most efficient manner.

9Sentencing in respect of Commonwealth offences is governed by the provisions of Part 1B of the Crimes Act. That Part includes the provisions of s 16A of the Act which specifies what might be described as a ""check list"" of matters that are to be taken into account in the sentencing of a federal offender.

10The application of the provisions of Part 1B of the Crimes Act must ensure that the necessary deterrent or punitive effects of sentences for serious tax evasion is reflected both in the head sentence and also in any provision for earlier release from custody. 

11There are many and varied factors relevant to the relative weight to be afforded to each factor in the overall sentencing process and the weight will vary according to the case. Relevant factors will often point in different directions. Those factors are of particular relevance in relation to the determination of the proportion that the pre-release period bears to the sentence of imprisonment to be imposed. That proportion, however, is to be determined in accordance with proper sentencing principles as applied to the circumstances of each individual case: Hilli v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45 at [42]-[43].

12As the Crown has submitted, the governing principle under s 16A(1) is the imposition of a sentence which is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances. Section 16A(2) requires that I take into account the matters that are identified in that section that are relevant and known to the Court. In accordance with relevant principles, the sentence to be imposed in relation to each offender must be such as to ensure that they are adequately punished and the penalty is not out of touch with the circumstances of the case such as to constitute an affront to the community: R v Gallagher (1991) 53 A Crim R 248; R v Pang (1999) 105 A Crim R 474.

13Section 16A(2) contains a catalogue of matters which I am obliged to take into account. Those of particular relevance in the present proceedings include:

Section 16A(2)

(a) the nature and circumstances of the offences;

(c) Any course of criminal conduct of which the offences are part;

(e) Any injury, loss and damage resulting from the offences;

(f) The degree (if any) to which the offenders have shown contrition for the offences;

(j) The deterrent effect that any sentences I am considering may have on the offenders;

(k) The need to ensure that they are adequately punished for the offences;

(m) The character, antecedents, age, means and physical or mental condition of the offender;

(n) The offender's prospects of rehabilitation.

(p) The probable effect that any sentence under consideration would have on the offender's families or dependants.

14Section 16A(2)(h), requires consideration of ""the degree to which (the offenders) have co-operated with law enforcement authorities in the investigation of the ... offences"". In the present case, the offenders participated in lengthy interviews in the course of investigations. There is no other aspect of co-operation other than the way in which the evidence was adduced at trial which, as I have earlier indicated, proceeded in a very efficient manner which both assisted the presentation of the Crown case, and assisted the jury in determining the matters requiring its determination.

15There is no particular evidence of any contrition for the offences.

16Section 17A directs me not to pass a sentence of imprisonment on an offender convicted of a Commonwealth offence unless, having considered all other available sentences, I am satisfied that no other sentence is appropriate in all the circumstances of the case.

17The first matter for consideration concerns the nature and circumstances of the offences. In that regard, I return to the relevant facts.

Facts

18During the period of the offending, both offenders were directors of a company, Inform Promotions (""Inform""). Mr Ronald Sakovits was secretary of that company until 30 June 2006, on which date Mrs Sakovits was appointed secretary of the company.

19Either or both of Mr and Mrs Sakovits authorised the lodgement of the company tax returns for Inform for the financial years ended 30 June 2000 to 30 June 2006.

20Their involvement in what has been characterised as a tax avoidance scheme during which the offences by them were committed occurred in circumstances in which their accountant, Lynette Liles, introduced them to a scheme which led to them participating in an offshore ""round robin"" arrangement involving a Vanuatu company, International Prestige Promotions (""IPPI""). The arrangement enabled the offenders to evade payment of both company and personal income tax.

21The company, IPPI, was incorporated by the offenders in Vanuatu at the suggestion and with the assistance of Ms Liles. The company income tax frauds were achieved through the transfer of monies from Australia to Vanuatu disguised as legitimate payments by Inform for the cost of services such as 'marketing and promotions' provided by IPPI.

22The offenders created or were party to the creation of false invoices purportedly raised by IPPI to give the appearance of the payments being for legitimate business expenses. The offenders and Liles falsely recorded the payments from Inform to IPPI in Inform's accounts as business expenses. Such false expenses in turn flowed through to the relevant company income tax returns, thereby reducing the company's taxable income declared to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and the overall amount of company tax paid. Due to the ATO's system of self-assessment, the tax returns were processed automatically, resulting in assessments being issued based on the tax returns depriving the ATO of the correct amount of tax.

23The offenders' participation in the arrangement caused a loss to the taxation revenue in the following respects:

(1) unpaid company tax on income fraudulently reduced by claims for the deduction from assessable income of fictitious business expenses; and

(2) unpaid personal tax through the fraudulent failure to declare as assessable income the monies received by the scheme participants in consequence of the international round robins (the receipts being dividends and hence part of their assessable incomes).

24The company tax shortfall resulting from the false claims for Inform over the years 2000-2006 was $530,789.

25The amounts falsely claimed as 'marketing and promotion' and other expenses in respect of the individual financial years may be summarised as follows:

(i) The financial year ended 30 June 2000, total expenses claimed amounted to $216,727, resulting in a tax shortfall of approximately $101,862.

(ii) In respect of the financial year ended 30 June 2001, total expenses falsely claimed was $231,538, resulting in a tax shortfall of approximately $46,313.

(iii) In respect of the financial year ended 30 June 2002, expenses falsely claimed was $181,766, together with 'agency fees' of $16,000 resulting in a tax shortfall of approximately $59,302.

(iv) In respect of the financial year ended 30 June 2003, expenses incorrectly claimed was $208,938.18, and 'agency fees' of $89,624 resulting in a tax shortfall of approximately $89,569.

(v) In respect of the financial year ended 30 June 2004, two groups of expenses were falsely claimed, the first amounted to $216,783.50, and the second, $257,534.80 resulting in a tax shortfall of approximately $112,475.

(vi) In respect of the financial year ended 30 June 2005, expenses falsely amounted to claim $268,582, and a further $94,384 resulting in a tax shortfall of approximately $89,448.

(vii) In respect of the financial year ended 30 June 2006, expenses falsely claimed as 'rent' was $109,150, and 'agency fees' of $106,071 resulting in a tax shortfall of approximately $31,821.

26The personal income tax shortfall resulting from Jane Sakovits' failure to declare her true assessable income for the seven financial years in question was $326,432.

27The personal income tax shortfall resulting from Ronald Sakovits' failure to declare his true assessable income for the seven financial years in question was approximately $320,672.

28The total company and personal income tax shortfall is approximately $1,177,893.

Particular Matters Relevant to Culpability Issues

29It has long been accepted that general deterrence is an important consideration in relation to taxation fraud, offences of that kind being difficult to detect, investigate and prosecute successfully.

30The Crown in its submissions on sentence referred to the well-established proposition that fraud on the Commonwealth revenue, absent exceptional circumstances, must attract the imposition of a full-time custodial sentence. The principles relating to offences involving revenue fraud are well established. 

31In the ultimate determination of sentence in respect of offences involving revenue fraud, consideration must be given to the following:

(i) The objective gravity of the offence,

(ii) The maximum sentence fixed by the legislature which defines the limit of the sentence for cases in the most serious category. I earlier referred to the maximum of ten years.

(iii) the importance of general deterrence, a matter that has been described as a predominant consideration in sentencing for offences of defrauding the revenue: R v O'Connor [2002] NSWCCA 156; See also R v Gregory [2011] VSCA 145 at [53]-[54].

32In determining the objective seriousness of the offending the following factual matters are to be considered and are taken into account:

(i) The tax evasion arrangement involved a sophisticated degree of planning and premeditation.

(ii) The amount of money defrauded was substantial.

(iii) The fact of a multiplicity of dishonest acts involved.

(iv) The period of time over which the offending took place (in the present case five years and five months approximately).

(v) The issue of motivation which, in these proceedings the Crown submitted was established by the evidence to have been self-interest.

33The evidence, in my opinion, establishes beyond reasonable doubt the presence of each of those matters in relation to the conduct giving rise to the subject offences.

34The terms of the method by which Mr and Mrs Sakovits transferred money from Inform to IPPI's bank account and then to distribute the funds in the account, were said to be not particularly complicated, as the Crown observed. However, by using the tax haven of Vanuatu as the place for IPPI's incorporation, as the Crown also observed, they were able to conceal their involvement in IPPI. The use of nominee directors and shareholders and the establishment of confidentiality agreements all meant that the offenders employed a degree of sophistication to conceal their involvement and which greatly reduced the possibility that the tax evasion would be discovered. The Crown further submitted, and I accept, that the difficulty and the cost of detection, given the efforts of the offenders to conceal the offending conduct by the use of false supporting documentation, is also a relevant factor in determining the sentences to be imposed.

35The Crown noted that the arrangement entered into by the offenders meant that they actively participated in 26 international transactions whereby they forwarded monies from Inform's bank account to the entity that controlled the IPPI account, namely Moores Rowland. The monies that were sent overseas were intended to give the appearance of the payment of legitimate business expenses that were claimed in the tax returns.

36Particular acts involved in the offending included both the transmission of funds and the obtaining of documents to conceal the offences from the authorities and their authorisation for the lodgement of both company tax returns in the relevant years and personal income tax returns.

37The Crown further submitted, and I accept, that the offenders' conduct involved a breach of the community's trust in circumstances where the tax system is based upon self-assessment which in turn depends upon the honesty and integrity of those who use it.

38The offending conduct took place over the period of five years and five months (between 1 April 2001 and 30 September 2006) indicating that the culpability involved was considerable in that it involved lengthy, persistent and calculated fraud.

39In terms of s 16A(2)(c) - namely whether the conduct forms part of a course of conduct consisting of a series of criminal acts, it is clear that the course of conduct in relation to the subject offences was of that character. That is a matter to be taken into account, not as an aggravating factor that increases the sentence to be imposed, but as indicating that the conduct was not an isolated incident. 

40Plainly the amount of the loss or damage resulting from the offences in terms of s 16A(2)(e) is an important factor in determining the sentences in the present proceedings. In that respect, the total amount of tax evaded amounted, as I have earlier indicated, to approximately $1,177,893. That amount, however, I note is substantially less than the total amount of tax evaded in the cases considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Boughen; R v Cameron, supra, which involved a total amount of $1,755,000 (a difference of approximately $577,000). I will return to the objective seriousness in those particular cases, that is in Boughen; Cameron, compared to the present case shortly.

41The sentences to be imposed are intended to reaffirm basic community values that all citizens according to their means should fairly share the burden of incidence of taxation so as to enable Government to provide for the community: R v Gregory, supra, at [57].

42I am required to have regard to the character, antecedents, age, means and physical or mental condition of the person to be sentenced. In the present proceedings, Mrs Sakovits is 62 years of age and Mr Sakovits is 64. Both have been business people having owned and operated their own businesses.

43Neither offender has a criminal record or a record of any other form of offending and, in particular, no record of taxation offences.

44Whilst the absence of any criminal antecedents is a factor to be taken into account, it has been accepted that less weight is to be given to good character where the offending has involved systematic defrauding of the revenue: R v Rivkin (2004) 184 FLR 364 at [410].

Submissions for the Offenders

45Mr Fagan SC on behalf of Mr and Mrs Sakovits stated that he could not challenge the characterisation of the offences as determined by the jury, as set out in the Crown's submissions and stated that, in light of the decisions of the High Court in R v Jones and R v Hilli, supra, and of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Boughen; R v Cameron, supra, his submissions were directed to seeking lenience with respect to the non-parole period: (T 28 March 2013 at p 9).

46Mr and Mrs Sakovits did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings. In those circumstances, relevant matters concerning their personal circumstances have been established, in part, by evidence given at trial and also the tender, at the sentencing hearing, of documentary evidence including in particular, medical reports and testimonials.

47Mr Fagan stated that the subjective factors of most importance were:

The age of the offenders.

The hardship to them in serving any full-time period in custody at their stage in life.

Their own ill health which will exacerbate and make more difficult the period of time in custody.

48On the issue of hardship in respect of time spent under a term of imprisonment, Mr Fagan submitted that the hardship would be exacerbated having regard in particular to the age and medical condition of Mrs Sakovits' mother who will be denied the offender's care of her thereby increasing the anguish, through being denied the ability to be with her mother. A further matter to which reference was made was the submission at T 10 as to family deprivation in terms of access and participation in the continuation of their family. 

49I have had regard to the medical reports of Dr Lachlan Soper, general practitioner, and will refer to them in a moment. The reports are dated 25 February 2013 and 19 March 2013 concerning Mr Sakovits and Mrs Sakovits respectively. They were tendered in evidence (Exhibits 1 and 2). They establish that both of them have received treatment, amongst other things, for significant stress and anxiety arising out of the investigation and charges that have culminated in their conviction. Dr Soper expressed the opinion that the stress may have contributed to a heart attack Mr Sakovits sustained on 18 April 2010 for which he was later stented in November 2010. The report otherwise provides details of Mr Sakovits' peripheral neuropathy and other conditions for which he is on medication, including medication for hypertension and other conditions that are detailed in the report.

50Dr Soper in his report in relation to Mrs Sakovits has set out in considerable detail her medical history and in particular her referral to a psychologist and treatment on antidepressant medication. He stated that many of his attendances upon her have focussed on anxiety and stress related conditions. Although her medication Efexor XR dose was doubled, attempts to reduce it have been unsuccessful. His report also refers to her diabetic condition, and other medical matters which need not here be detailed, which have required medical care and treatment.

51It is apparent that both offenders will require ongoing medical attendances and supervision and monitoring in relation to a number of medical issues and the prescription of required medications.

52It is accepted that an offender's psychological and medical health and age may increase the hardship of a sentence and may therefore be taken into account in deciding what sentence is appropriate, but that consideration is limited by the necessity of maintaining proper standards of punishment: R v Hart [1999] NSWCCA 204 per Sperling J at [8].

53Whilst a sentencing judge is entitled, in arriving at the appropriate penalty, to take into account an offender's age, health, generally speaking, those factors of themselves do not mean that a term of imprisonment should not be imposed if it is otherwise warranted. They are factors that may, instead, affect the length of a custodial sentence. In the present proceedings, I consider that the evidence as to the age and states of health of each of Mr and Mrs Sakovits are matters that must be taken into account in the sentence determinations in accordance with the provisions of s 16A(2)(m).

54A further matter relied upon in mitigation of penalty was the circumstance that the offenders were induced into the tax evasion arrangement by their accountant who was described as ""an influential accountant"". In this latter respect, reference was made to the sentencing remarks concerning Liles, in particular the information available from those remarks and from other cases which indicated that Liles had drafted numerous clients into the tax evasion schemes promoted by her. I have read the sentencing remarks concerning Liles.

55These circumstances were said to place the offenders' participation in a correct light. Mr Fagan submitted that, on the basis of the material available the offenders were people who would not have ever considered initiating such a tax evasion scheme as was promoted by Liles and that they were in effect inducted into it. The sentence imposed upon Liles was said to give recognition of her ""initiating role with relation to many of these people"", as Mr Fagan put it: (T 28 March 2013, at p 10).

56The fact that a professional accountant like Liles proposed the tax evasion scheme is both an appalling fact and one that sheds some light upon the circumstances that led to the present case. However, this is a circumstance which Simpson J considered. Her Honour wrote the lead judgment in R v Boughen; R v Cameron, supra:

57In R v Boughen; R v Cameron a submission was made that weight should be given to the fact that the respondents had been inveigled or lured into the scheme. Simpson J however observed:

""[95] ... Had the fraudulent conduct ceased on, or soon after, the respondents' realisation of its true character, this circumstance may have had some weight. Given that the conduct continued for another seven years after that realisation, its significance is diminished to almost nothing.""

58Whilst there are relevant difference in those cases, given the jury's verdict in the present cases, a similar view must, in my view, be taken.

Delay

59A further matter relied upon in Mr Fagan's submissions was the question of delay. In this respect, he described Mr and Mrs Sakovits as having been ""in limbo"" with respect to the subject of these proceedings for a long time. In May 2005, officers of the Australian Taxation Office first came to their premises and re-attended again in June 2006, and then in December 2007, police executed search warrants. A year later (2008), they were asked to take part in a Record of Interview, which they did. In early 2009, it was said they were charged with the subject offences. The submission was that they had accordingly been under ""the pressure and the uncertainty and the apprehension of these proceedings and their outcome for many many years"": (T 28 March 2013 at p 10-11). It was said in all to have been a period of 8 years from the first visit by officers from the Australian Taxation Office.

60Mr Fagan made it clear that he did not suggest fault on behalf of the authorities in relation to the delay and that, apart from the offenders wishing to defend themselves and put forward their case, they had not otherwise exacerbated the delay. The period of uncertainty with which they have lived, it was submitted, must have caused extreme anguish and one from which, particularly in the light of the medical evidence, it could be inferred did place great stress upon each of them. I have indicated earlier that I accept the substance of that submission.

61The delay in this case was substantial and it is clear on the evidence that it has severely impacted upon Mr and Mrs Sakovits. I consider that the proper administration of justice in this case requires that I take that matter into account. It is a matter I have taken into account in determining the appropriate length of the custodial period in respect of the sentences to be imposed.

Personal Circumstances

62I turn to another personal circumstance which concerns the poor health of Mrs Sakovits' mother. The evidence called at the sentence hearing established that Mrs Sakovits' mother is elderly and in a very ill condition. Section 16A(2)(p) of the Crimes Act, entitles and requires that I am to bring into account family consequences subject to one condition. The circumstances may not be given substantial weight in the sentencing determination unless they can be characterised as ""exceptional"": R v Togias [2001] NSWCCA 522 at [9]-[17]; R v Hinton [2002] NSWCCA 405; 134 A Crim R 286 at [31]; R v Agius [2012] NSWSC 978 at [87]. It appears likely that Mrs Sakovits' mother will not return home and will be admitted to an appropriate care institution. Whilst the impact, in particular, upon Mrs Sakovits of her mother's condition is understandably a matter of great and serious concern, on the construction which the relevant case law authorities have placed upon the provisions of s 16A(2)(p), the evidence does not enable me to make a finding that the circumstances can be characterised as ""exceptional"" for the purposes of applying that provision.

63Mr Fagan SC on behalf of Mr and Mrs Sakovits, referred to one factual consideration which was not the subject of evidence but which he put on instructions and which Mr Fagan submitted flows from the figures that had been given for the amount of tax, namely, the financial impact upon them. Having regard to their liabilities and that of the company to the Australian Taxation Office, being both primary tax and shortfall penalty taxes, Mr Fagan stated on instructions that they have been ruined by such liabilities.

64It was also noted in submissions that the business previously operated by Mrs Sakovits cannot be sustained if she is imprisoned for a substantial period. That would mean that, at her age, her livelihood through self-employment has been lost and that this constitutes a significant penalty on both Mr and Mrs Sakovits.

65On this latter aspect, the Crown, however, noted that financial hardship to an offender because of imprisonment is not a relevant consideration: R v Bragias (1997) 92 A Crim R 330 at 333. The Crown submission in this regard must, in my view, be accepted.

66There was tendered in evidence, seven testimonials from persons who have known the offenders for very lengthy periods of time. There is a common theme amongst them. It is that Mr and Mrs Sakovits have been hardworking people of good character with strong family values and who have supported friends in times of hardship. They have also acted, throughout, in recent years at least, as the primary carers to Mrs Sakovits' mother. It is clear from the evidence that they were each persons of prior good character and of unblemished reputation. It is also clear that they have, as I indicated, strong family support and the continued respect and support of many members of the community. These are favourable matters so far as their future is concerned. 

67A number of those providing testimonials have referred to the evident impact that the stress upon them over the years as a result of the investigation and the proceedings that have led to their conviction. 

68I take all those matters into account in determining sentence in accordance with established principle. That said, as it has been observed, however painful it may be for sentencing judges, they are required to consider and appropriately balance all matters required to be taken into account by statute and in accordance with principle without losing sight of the importance in a particular case of the need to give effect to the principle of general deterrence. This has repeatedly been emphasised by appellate authority: R v Boughen; R v Cameron at [96]; R v Hili; R v Jones at [63].

Sentencing Decisions

69Sentences imposed in other cases involving serious tax evasion have been referred to in the submissions for the Crown and on behalf of the offenders. They stand as a yardstick against which to examine the proposed sentences, an exercise I have undertaken. However, sentences in such cases do not establish the upper and lower limits of any range of sentences as necessarily being the correct limits in the individual case. It is necessary to examine the circumstances of such comparator cases and by doing so to identify the unifying principles that guide or account for sentences imposed in individual cases.

70I turn to the judgment of the Court of Appeal in R v Boughen; R v Cameron, supra, to which I earlier referred and which has been referred to in the submissions on behalf of the Crown and the offenders. Whilst I am conscious of the limitation on the use of historical sentencing data, I consider it appropriate to refer briefly to the facts and circumstances of that case, and the sentences imposed upon the respondents in those proceedings.

71Both the offenders Boughen and Cameron each pleaded guilty to two counts. The first count was of conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth between 1 July 1997 and 23 May 2001, contrary to the provisions of the Crimes Act 1914 (ss 29D and 86).

72The second count was a charge of conspiracy to dishonestly cause a loss to the Commonwealth (Criminal Code 1995, s 135.4(3)), between 24 May 2001 and 31 July 2004.

73Notwithstanding their initial naivety, by 1997, both respondents in those cases were well aware of the fraudulent nature of the arrangement in which they were involved. Over a period of time, Boughen evaded income tax of $520,000, Cameron evaded income tax of $506,000 and their company, Concept, evaded income tax of $727,000.

74The offending conduct by each of the respondents in that case was objectively more serious than the present cases insofar as:

(a) In R v Boughen; R v Cameron the offending took place over a period of seven years, in contrast to the present cases where the offending took place over a period of five years and five months.

(b) The total of personal and company tax avoided was greater than in the present cases ($1,755,000 as against $1,077,893), a difference of tax avoided in the present case, as I have earlier noted, of $577,107.

75In addition, the period of delay between the execution of search warrants and the sentence hearing in R v Boughen; R v Cameron was three years. In the present case the delay between the execution of search warrants and the present sentence hearing has been five years and four months. 

76In R v Boughen; R v Cameron the offenders entered guilty pleas for which they were entitled to a discount on sentence together with a discount for assistance. On re-sentencing by the Court of Criminal Appeal, allowing for their pleas of guilty, Cameron was sentenced to a three-year period of imprisonment to be released after 18 months on recognisance without surety to be of good behaviour for a period of 18 months.

77The sentence imposed upon the offender Boughen was also a term of imprisonment of 3 years, with 18 months on recognisance to be of good behaviour for a period of 18 months.

78The sentences in both those cases was arrived at after allowance for sentencing discounts. The sentences were derived from a starting point of 6 years: R v Boughen; R v Cameron at [105]. 

79The appropriate total sentences, allowing for the reduction of a 40% discount, was considered to be 3 years and 7 months: at [127]. By reason of the respondents having served compliance with the terms of the Intensive Correction Orders imposed by the original sentencing judge and further delay in finalisation, Simpson J with whom the other two judges agreed, reduced the sentence to 3 years. That result was arrived at, as noted, after allowance for the 40% combined discount for guilty pleas and assistance. In considering the sentences imposed in that case, as providing guidance in the present case, the fact of the permitted sentencing discount is an important one to be taken into account.

80In determining sentence it is necessary to have regard to the fact that each offender has been convicted on two charges. That, as I earlier explained, was solely due to the structuring and restructuring of the Commonwealth criminal legislation. It is clear that the offenders were guilty of a single conspiracy that continued over the whole of the charge period. In accordance with ordinary sentencing principles that would indicate that a single sentence ought to be imposed.

81However, in the present cases concerning Mr and Mrs Sakovits, the existence of two counts, in respect of each of which an appropriate sentence must be passed in relation to each count precludes that course. Individual sentences must be imposed, appropriate to the criminality involved in each offence: R v Pearce [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 at 624. Questions of accumulation and concurrence of sentences are then to be considered. The position that arises in the present cases also arose in R v Boughen; R v Cameron, supra, and was discussed by Simpson J at [125]-[126] of the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal. Her Honour there observed that although the application of the principle in Pearce was somewhat artificial in sentencing the respondents, it was a requirement that had to be complied with. Her Honour observed that the offending in that case in relation to each count was of approximately equal duration and proceeded to impose terms of imprisonment of equal duration in respect of each charge in those circumstances. 

82Count 1 in this case, as earlier noted, covers only a brief period (1 April 2001 to 23 May 2001) whereas Count 2 covers the period 24 May 2001 and 30 September 2006.

83I have concluded that as in R v Boughen; R v Cameron, I am required to impose separate sentences. I propose to make the sentence on Count 1 wholly concurrent with the sentence to be imposed with respect to Count 2 in accordance with the submissions made by Mr Fagan.

Sentences

JANE MARIA SAKOVITS

84For the purposes of s 17A(1) of the Crimes Act, having considered all sentencing options, I am satisfied that, and indeed bound, that in all the circumstances of the case, no sentence other than imprisonment is appropriate. That is because the offending involved deliberate and systematic and repeated acts to defraud the revenue.

85I propose to fix sentences relevant to each offence and make the sentences concurrent. In respect of the offence the subject of Count 1 on the indictment I will impose a sentence of 6 months. In respect of Count 2 on the indictment I will impose a sentence of 5 years with a recognisance release order after the offender has served a period of 2 years and 6 months.

Jane Maria Sakovits

(1) In respect of Count 1 on the indictment, I sentence you to imprisonment for a period of 6 months commencing 26 April 2013 and expiring on 25 October 2013.

(2) In respect of the Count 2 on the indictment I sentence you to imprisonment for a period of 5 years commencing on 26 April 2013 and expiring on 25 April 2018. 

The sentence imposed with respect to Count 1 is to operate concurrently with the sentence imposed in respect of Count 2. 

In respect of the sentence on Count 2 on the expiration of 2 years and 6 months, namely 25 October 2015, I order you be released upon giving security in the amount of $200, without surety by recognisance, to the satisfaction of the Court, and that you comply with the conditions specified in s 20(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1914.

RONALD RUDOLPH SAKOVITS

86For the purposes of s 17A(1) of the Crimes Act, having considered all sentencing options, I am satisfied that, in all the circumstances of the case, no sentence other than imprisonment is appropriate. That is by reason of the deliberate, calculated or systematic acts constituting the offices.

87I propose to fix sentences relevant to each offence and make the sentences concurrent. In respect of the offence the subject of Count 1 on the indictment I will impose a sentence of 6 months. In respect of Count 2 on the indictment I will impose a sentence of 5 years and a recognisance release order is to operate after Mr Sakovits has served a period of 2 years and 6 months.

Ronald Rudolph Sakovits

(1) In respect of Count 1 on the indictment, I sentence you to imprisonment for a period of 6 months commencing 26 April 2013 and expiring on 25 October 2013.

(2) In respect of Count 2 on the indictment I sentence you to imprisonment for 5 years commencing on 26 April 2013 and expiring on 25 April 2018. 

The sentence imposed with respect to Court 1 is to operate concurrently with the sentence imposed in respect of Count 2. 

On the expiration of a period of 2 years and 6 months, namely 25 October 2015, I order you be released upon giving security in the amount of $200, without surety, by recognisance to the satisfaction of the Court, that you comply with the conditions specified in s 20(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1914.

In each case the security will be $200. The recognisance release orders I have made have been amended to so specify.

2706849,New South Wales Crime Commission v Johan [2013] NSWSC 438,"EX TEMPORE Judgment

1These proceedings were commenced by summons on 23 April 2009. For reasons published that day by Johnson J orders were made under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 with respect to the defendants.

2Today, the parties have approached the Court asking that further orders be made by consent so as to finalise the proceedings.

3The proposed orders are orders under s 12(1) of the Act in relation to variation of existing orders made. The first is an order pursuant to 12(1) of the Act varying the first restraining order so that it does not apply to the interest of the first defendant in the property specified in schedule 2 to the order. The second is another order under section 12(1) of the Act varying an existing restraining order so that it does not apply to the interest of the second defendant in the property specified in schedule 3 to the order.

4The third is an order directing the release of a part of the property restrained to the second defendant. Next, are orders under s 27(1) of the Act requiring the first defendant to pay the Treasurer the sum of $12,800 and the second defendant to pay the Treasurer the sum of $134,500. There are also orders pursuant to s 101 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 as to interest and an order pursuant to s 10B(4) of the Act that a property at Lurnea may be sold or charged, mortgaged, licensed, leased or otherwise used to raise finance to satisfy either or both of the first or second proceeds assessments orders, already made in these proceedings.

5There are various things noted in the proposed orders including that the first defendant guarantees payment by the second defendant of the second proceeds assessment order and that in consideration of these orders being made, the first defendant and second defendant release the Crown and the plaintiff from any claim for damages in consequence of the making of the first restraining order or otherwise and agree not to appeal from or seek leave to appeal from any order made in these proceedings.

6Having considered the orders which have been made in the proceedings and what is proposed by way of final consent order in order to finalise these proceedings, I am satisfied that justice dictates that the Court's discretion should be exercised in order to make the consent orders which the parties propose.

7For those reasons, I make orders in terms of the proposed consent orders filed today.

2706850,New South Wales Crime Commission v Gallagher [2013] NSWSC 439,"EX TEMPORE Judgment

1In this matter, the proceedings were commenced by summons filed in Court on 18 May 2012 by which the plaintiff sought various orders including an order pursuant to s 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990. For reasons published by Adamson J that day, orders were made pursuant to the Act.

2Today, the parties have approached the Court seeking further orders pursuant to s 12(1) of the Act, varying the existing orders so that they do not apply to interests in property of the defendant identified in schedule 1 of the order. Additionally, that pursuant to s 27(1) of the Act the defendant pay to the treasurer the sum of $40,000. Nextly, that pursuant to section 10B(4)(b) of the Act, the interest of the defendant in the property specified in schedule 2 to the order may be sold at a price agreed to in writing by the plaintiff or that it be refinanced to enable the proceeds assessment order to be satisfied. Nextly, an order that pursuant to s 101 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 as to interest in proceeds.

3The proposed order notes, amongst other things, that in consideration of the orders being made the defendant releases the Crown and the plaintiff, from any claim to damages in consequence of the making of restraining orders or otherwise; agrees not to make any further applications under s 10B(3) of the Act; and agrees not to appeal from or seek leave to appeal from any order made in these proceedings.

4Having considered the terms of the proposed consent orders, I am satisfied that justice dictates that the Court's discretion should be exercised in the terms that the parties have agreed and, accordingly, make orders in terms of the consent orders filed today.

1These proceedings were commenced by summons filed 31 January 2013. On that day, Harrison J made ex parte orders pursuant to s 10A and other provisions of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 restraining the defendant from taking certain steps in relation to property described in the schedules to the summons.

2Today, the parties ask the Court to make consent orders in terms which have been filed. Those orders contemplate leave being granted to the plaintiff to amend the summons in terms which have been filed in Court today; an order being made pursuant to s 22 of the Act forfeiting to and investing in the Crown the interest in property of the defendant specified in schedule 2 to the order, that being some $99,950 cash seized on 11 December 2012 by police, and a second amount of cash of $214,400 seized by police on 10 December 2012, as well as an order dismissing the application for an unexplained wealth order. 

3The consent orders note various matters in relation to the institution of the proceedings and also that in consideration of the orders being made, the defendant releases the Crown and the plaintiff from any claim for damages in consequence of the making of the restraining order or otherwise; agrees not to appeal from or seek leave to appeal from any order made in the proceedings; and agrees not to make applications under s 24, s 25 or s 26 of the Act.

4It is also noted that by virtue of the provisions of s 10D(1) of the Act, the restraining order ceases to remain in force at the time of entry of these orders and that the plaintiff and the defendants have to pay their own costs.

5Having considered the circumstances in which the parties seek the making of the proposed consent orders and the terms of the orders themselves and the matters there referred to, I am satisfied that justice dictates that the Court's powers be exercised to make orders in the terms agreed. For those reasons, I make orders in terms of the consent orders filed today 26 April 2013.

2706861,Langbein v R [2013] NSWCCA 88,"Judgment

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Fullerton and Campbell JJ.

2FULLERTON AND CAMPBELL JJ: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed in the District Court on 29 July 2011. 

3On 23 March 2011 the applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to two counts of aggravated break and enter and commit serious indictable offence contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, both of which were committed on separate premises in the early hours of 4 October 2010 in the company of a co-offender. In respect of the second count, two offences were taken into account on a Form 1 pursuant to s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, namely an aggravated attempt break and enter with intent, committed the same night as the two primary offences, and a break, enter and steal committed on 11 January 2007 at a hairdressing salon in Carrington when the applicant was a juvenile. $2000 was stolen. An offence of driving whilst disqualified committed on the same night as the principle offences, was dealt with pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 

4The applicant committed the offences in breach of a two year good behaviour bond imposed under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in the Local Court on 18 August 2009 for three offences involving his partner, including intimidating her with the intent to cause fear, causing damage to her motor vehicle and driving the motor vehicle whilst disqualified. On 23 March 2011 he was dealt with in the Local Court for breach of the bond. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 3 months which expired on 16 February 2011. 

5The sentences imposed in the District Court were ordered to commence at the expiration of that sentence as follows:

(a)For the driving offence, 9 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 months commencing on 17 February 2011 and expiring on 16 August 2011. The balance of term expired on 16 November 2011.

(b)For the aggravated break, enter and steal on one set of premises (the C4 Café), 3 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months commencing on 17 August 2011 and expiring on 16 November 2013. The balance of term is due to expire on 16 August 2014.

(c)For the second aggravated break, enter and cause malicious damage to different premises (the Devine Café), and after taking into account the offences on the Form 1, 4 years and 6 months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 3 years, partially accumulated on the previous sentence to commence on 17 August 2012 and expiring on 16 August 2015. The balance of term is due to expire on 16 February 2017.

6The Crown accepted that the pleas of guilty were entered in the Local Court on 23 March 2011 at the earliest available opportunity, attracting a discount of 25 per cent.

7His Honour found that there were no special circumstances justifying a variation in the statutory ratio fixed by s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act between the non-parole period and the additional term in respect of each offence.

8A total effective sentence of 6 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months was imposed.

Grounds of appeal

9The applicant advanced the following grounds of appeal:

(1)The sentencing judge erred by failing to find that the applicant was remorseful, contrary to the evidence.

(2)The sentence imposed is manifestly excessive.

The facts for sentencing purposes

10The evidence in the proceedings on sentence consisted of a statement of agreed facts and the applicant's criminal antecedents. The applicant gave evidence, as did his partner Rebecca Haddow. A number of statements were tendered attesting to the applicant's subjective circumstances. 

11In the early hours of 4 October 2010, the applicant, in company with his co-offender, drove Ms Haddow's car to the Devine Café, the Pioneer Estate Winery, Medowie. They broke in. In doing so they caused damage to the doors of the café. Once inside they stole various items of personal property including a television set valued at $2500. Additionally, they rummaged through and ransacked the kitchen area of the café. The estimated cost of repairing the damage was $23,847. The café owners were apparently uninsured and, unable to make good their losses, were forced out of business with trade debts totalling $20,000.

12The applicant and his co-offender then forced their way into the cellar of the winery where they caused additional damage before returning to the applicant's home with the stolen television. 

13Later that morning the applicant and his co-offender went to the Ferodale shopping centre, also at Medowie, where they attempted to break into a bottle shop. They were unsuccessful, but destroyed a glass door, including its lock, in the process (this was the second matter listed on the Form 1). They then went next door and broke into the C4 Café, smashing the glass front door to gain entry. Once inside they broke plates and stole packets of potato chips. They also damaged the rear door of the premises. They absconded when the café's internal alarm was activated.

14They fled in Ms Haddow's car. The attention of the police was attracted by the manner of the applicant's driving. A police pursuit ensued. The applicant eventually abandoned the car and ran away on foot.

15Police searched the car and located evidence implicating the applicant, including some of the property stolen from the Devine Café and a sledgehammer coated in gyprock dust, indicative of it being used to affect the break-ins. 

16For reasons that are not entirely clear, the police arrested the applicant in January 2011. The agreed facts suggest that at least part of the explanation was because of attempts by the applicant to evade arrest. 

17The applicant was 22 as at the date of sentence. He was in a long-term relationship with Ms Haddow. They had three children under three years of age. 

18The applicant gave evidence that he had been subjected to violence and abuse from his father before his father left the family home when the applicant was a teenager. He said he developed a problem with alcohol from about the age of fourteen or fifteen and that he also abused other drugs from about the same age. About his drug and alcohol problem he said:
I need to get some help so I can be there for me family and stay out of trouble, stop committing crime. 

19On sentence he gave evidence of remorse as follows:
Q. Just regarding this offence, how do you feel, or what would you say to the owners of the café if they were in the, I don't know whether they are, but if they were in the court what would you say to them?

A. Words can't explain how sorry I am to 'em. The amount of damage that was done, which was ridiculous, not just that, heaps of other people were affected. I think the business had to close so other people would've missed out on their wages and stuff, the employees. It's ridiculous. 

20Under cross-examination, he said:
As I said I never used to have nothing to worry about and that but now that I've got children I've spent a long period of time away from it's made me snap back to reality and realise that I need to get help so I can give them a good life and shelter them from the path that I've chosen. 

21He went on to say:
As I said, this is the first time I've ever spent a long time - period of time away from my children. I don't want that to happen again. I don't want them to make the same mistakes that I've made in the past. 

22He described the events of 4 October in the following terms:
Just a night of alcohol-fuelled stupidity and I - if I could do anything to take it back, I would. 

23He said that when released from jail and working he would be ""more than willing to make some monetary repayments"".

24Ms Haddow gave evidence that the applicant had changed his attitude to his family responsibilities since his arrest and remand. 

25In a written statement, Ms Haddow's father said he noticed a vast improvement in the applicant's attitude towards his family from letters he had seen that had been written from jail. Also in a written statement, Jason Adams, the applicant's workmate, said he had visited the applicant in jail and the applicant ""was very apologetic for his actions towards the victims and his family for his absence"". He also said that during the time they worked together, the applicant was very reliable. In a written statement, Arthur Lovett said that the applicant had worked for him doing construction work and that he had shown ""great aptitude for these trades"". He said he would be prepared to re-employ the applicant on his release. Jason Scholes, wrote that he had employed the applicant in his bricklaying business at some unspecified time in the past and spoke highly of his reliability and work ethic. He said he would re-employ the applicant provided he had a current drivers' licence. (I interpolate that the primary judge disqualified the applicant from holding a drivers' licence for three years from 29 July 2011.) 

The remarks on sentence

26After detailing the facts relevant to the commission of both of the aggravated break and enter offences, the primary judge described each offence as serious, as reflected in the maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and the standard non-parole period of 5 years. 

27His Honour also had regard to the standard non-parole period as a guidepost to the determination of an appropriate sentence in accordance with the approach mandated by Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120; 212 A Crim R 254.

28His Honour found that both offences were premeditated. He also referred to the prevalence of offences of this kind, and the losses, and sense of loss, suffered by the respective proprietors. 

29His Honour said that he knew little of the applicant's background or upbringing, his education or employment and physical and mental health. He made no reference to the statements of Arthur Lovett or Jason Scholes. He acknowledged the applicant's relationship with is partner and that he was the father of small children.

30He referred to the applicant's very poor antecedent criminal history and noted that the applicant had been dealt with for 39 offences the great majority of which were property offences of various kinds including multiple entries for break, enter and steal. His Honour remarked:
I think that it is both obvious and fair to say that he has learned nothing from the sentences imposed upon him for earlier committed offences. I do not refer to his criminal past as an aggravating factor of the subject offences, but it is relevant to such issues as remorse, rehabilitation, re-offending and deterrence.

31His Honour noted that the applicant was subject to conditional liberty when he committed the subject offences which he regarded as an aggravating factor. This finding was, of course, open to him under s 21A(2)(j) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.

32Although his Honour allowed a discount of 25 per cent for his early guilty plea, he said:
I doubt, notwithstanding his guilty pleas and his evidence, that he is remorseful for what he has done. Notwithstanding that I do not know what evidence police gathered in the investigation of the offences, I think that his guilty pleas show his realisation of the strength of the crown's case and his acceptance of the inevitable results. Frankly, I doubt that he has given a moment's thought to what he did and to the effect that what he did might have had upon the operators of the cafes and shop at where (sic) he and his co-offender committed the offences.

I cannot say that he has good prospects for rehabilitation or that he is unlikely to re-offend. He has a history of committing similar offences to the subject offences. He was subject to a good behaviour bond and a community service order when he committed the subject offences. I suspect that his future will be much like his past. However, I accept that he, like every other sinner, is not beyond redemption and that he may turn over a new page in his book of life but, like so many things in life, only time will tell. 

33His Honour made reference to the testimonials tendered on the applicant's behalf but apparently gave them little weight expressing the view that he suspected the authors were unaware of the extent of the applicant's criminal offending. 

34His Honour also said:
Mr Langbein must be reminded that repeated offending will not be condoned or tolerated, and offending will result in ever-increasing sentences of imprisonment. Others who may think of doing what the offenders did, and what they did was easy to do, and often the offenders are not apprehended, must be deterred by sentences imposed upon offenders, like these offenders, from doing what they did. (ROS 15)

35It was not submitted that the apparent weight given to both general and specific deterrence was not open to him.

36His Honour expressly refused to make a finding of special circumstances warranting or justifying a variation of the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the parole period on the basis that such circumstances as were revealed by the evidence were not sufficiently ""special"". 

The submissions of the parties

37In relation to the first ground of appeal, counsel for the applicant relied on the evidence of remorse led on sentence and that the evidence was not challenged by the Crown. Whilst he acknowledged that a sentencing judge is not bound to accept assertions by an offender that he is remorseful, even when that assertion is made in the witness box (Alvarez v R [2011] NSWCCA 33; 209 A Crim R 297 at [65]), he submitted that the fact that the evidence was not expressly referred to by his Honour strongly supported the inference that it was overlooked and not given the weight it deserved in mitigation of sentence under s 21A(3)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (see R v Thomas [2007] NSWCCA 269 at [18] - [19]; R v Butters [2010] NSWCCA 1 at [16] - [17] and Pfitzner v R [2010] NSWCCA 314 at [33]). It was submitted that when the evidence of remorse was considered in the context of the applicant's relative youth, his Honour's pessimism as to whether the applicant was genuinely remorseful, and his pessimism as regards prospects of rehabilitation, were not findings open to him.

38The Crown submitted that the primary judge was entitled to regard the evidence of remorse as nothing more than an expression of regret over the fact that he was arrested and charged and that, in light of the evidence implicating him, a conviction was inevitable. In our view, that was a finding open on the evidence as one factor diminishing the weight of the evidence of remorse (see Windle v R [2011] NSWCCA 277 at [47]). 

39It was further submitted that the genuineness of evidence of remorse is a question of fact in respect of which the sentencing judge is afforded a wide discretion with which this court would rarely intervene in the absence of error of the kind identified in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499. The Crown also submitted that viewed in the light of the applicant's antecedent criminal history including, in part, that the offences were committed in breach of a s 9 bond imposed in August 2009, that despite the applicant's expressions of concern about his own family's predicament, it was open to the judge to reject his testimony as evidence of sincere remorse. 

40As it was developed orally, the second ground of appeal related not to the individual sentences, which counsel accepted, although heavy, were within an available discretionary range, but to the partial accumulation of 18 months across all three counts which he submitted was productive of a sentencing outcome which was excessive in all the circumstances. 

41The Crown submitted the objective seriousness of the offending, including the losses suffered by the owners of the Devine Café; the applicant's previous criminal history and his Honour's findings about the poor prospects of rehabilitation justified the imposition of the sentences imposed. She also submitted the judge's approach to partial accumulation was appropriate given that the two counts of aggravated break and enter were completely discrete as was the driving offence. 

Ground 1

42Although his Honour did not refer to the evidence of remorse in detail, or to the fact that the applicant's evidence was supported by his partner and Jason Adams, a former workmate, he did refer to the evidence in general terms. He also had the advantage of assessing the evidence of the applicant and Ms Haddow which an appellate court does not enjoy.

43Even were we inclined to afford remorse greater weight (about which we prefer to express no view), that does not establish appealable error or justify intervention. His Honour's acceptance or rejection of the evidence was a discretionary matter and, in this case, we can see no discernible error in its exercise. 

44We would reject the first ground of appeal.

Ground 2

45The question whether a sentence is manifestly excessive (or manifestly inadequate) is whether it can be said that the sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust (see Hili v R [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [59] - [60]). 

46Accepting the applicant's concession that an appropriate sentence was fixed for each offence, the challenge is limited to the extent of accumulation and the totality of the effective sentence imposed. As this Court has long recognised, questions of accumulation and totality are matters primarily within the discretion of the sentencing judge with which this Court is reluctant to intervene (see Hernandez v R [2013] NSWCCA 51 at [43]). Unlike the facts in Hernandez, in this case there is a distinct overlap in the factual circumstances involved in the driving offence and each of the two offences of aggravated break and enter (given that the vehicle he drove without a license was driven to and from both premises) which as a matter of principle did not justify an accumulation of six months on the sentence imposed on the first of those two offences.

47In addition, we are persuaded that an excessive effective sentence was imposed by reason of the accumulation of 12 months between the sentences imposed on the two counts of aggravated break and enter. Despite the fact that they involved separate premises, they were nonetheless committed in one episode of criminality of relatively short, if destructive, duration. While we are satisfied that this necessitated some accumulation of the individual sentences on those two counts in order to ensure that the effective sentence reflected the overall criminality comprehended by the offending, in our judgment an accumulated sentence of 5 years and 6 months with an effective 4 year non-parole period was excessive, in the sense that it exceeded a sentence required to properly reflect the total criminality of those two offences. 

48We are also of the opinion that another sentence is warranted in law. It follows then that it is necessary for this Court to re-sentence the applicant. 

49Although not a separate ground of appeal, counsel also submitted that his Honour ought to have found special circumstances justifying a variation of the statutory ratio established by s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. We are not persuaded that the applicant has demonstrated appealable error in this regard. However, since we are otherwise persuaded that error has been made out and that re-sentence is necessary it is open to us to form its own view about whether there were circumstances sufficiently special in the statutory sense to justify an alteration in the s 44(2) ratio.

Re-sentencing

50Two affidavits were relied upon on re-sentence, one from the applicant and one from his solicitor. They established that the applicant has completed the ""Enough is Enough"" one day workshop directed to ""Responsibility, Rehabilitation, Reintegration"" and he has attended twelve sessions of the ""Getting SMART Program"". On 10 September 2012 he commenced the Intensive Drug and Alcohol Treatment program which calls for his participation three days a week for twelve months. The other two (working) days he is employed in the Metal Shop.

51We acknowledge that the maximum penalty for the aggravated break and enter offences is 20 years with a statutory non-parole period of 5 years. We are also satisfied the offences involve significant objective criminality and that the individual sentences must reflect specific and general deterrence, aggravated by the fact that the applicant was on a s 9 bond. We also take into account the offences on the Form 1 in imposing sentence on the offence involving the Devine Café, noting that one of them occurred on the same night as the subject offences.

52Given his Honour's forensic advantage we feel constrained to accept his Honour's finding as to the question of remorse. 

53As to the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation, we acknowledge the weight of the affidavits read on the appeal. The applicant has undertaken courses whilst in custody directed to assist in his re-education and rehabilitation and he is apparently committed to addressing longstanding drug and alcohol abuse which, on the applicant's evidence, we accept as providing some context in which the offences were committed. This material has led us to form a different view from his Honour as to the existence of special circumstances. In addition, after taking into account the fact that there should be partial accumulation (albeit ameliorated) of the sentences on counts 2 and 3, we consider that this is a case that falls into that category where the offender and the community will benefit if the applicant has a longer period under supervision in the community upon his eventual release from custody.

54We are conscious that the effective non-parole period must appropriately reflect the criminality involved in each offence and of the necessity to avoid inappropriate double counting when considering the question of special circumstances. We are also conscious of the need to be satisfied that there are circumstances sufficiently special to disturb the statutory ratio and reduce the non-parole periods (see R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704; 126 A Crim R 525 at [68]). In this case, since we propose to confirm the sentences imposed by the sentencing judge, and since it is clear his Honour gave little, if any weight to rehabilitation, we are satisfied the applicant's now greatly improved prospects of rehabilitation will result in no double counting were we to afford him a finding of special circumstances for that reason. We are also satisfied that if allowed a longer than usual period under supervision in the community his continuing rehabilitation is likely to be successful (see R v Carter [2003] NSWCCA 243).

55To give effect to our finding, we would not disturb the sentences imposed on any of the three counts, but would direct that on the sentence in respect of the driving offence run concurrently with the sentence in respect of the offence committed at the C4 Café and that the sentence imposed for that offence and the offence committed at the Devine Café be accumulated by a period of three months. 

56Finally, we would adjust the statutory ratio between non-parole period and balance of term in respect of the offences at the Devine Café and the C4 Café to reflect our finding of special circumstances. 

57As the orders will make clear, the total effective sentence we propose is 4 years and 9 months commencing on 17 February 2011 and expiring on 16 November 2015. The effective non-parole period is 3 years and 3 months commencing on 17 February 2011, also reflecting a variation to the statutory ratio which, after accumulation has been moderated to ensure that the mandatory period of custody appropriately reflects the overall criminality. The earliest date upon which the applicant will be eligible for release to parole is 17 May 2014. We note that the applicant is expected to have completed the Intensive Drug and Alcohol Treatment Program in which he is currently participating by that date.

58The orders we propose, therefore, are:

1. Grant leave to appeal.

2. Appeal allowed.

3. Confirm the sentences imposed by the sentencing judge in respect of the offence of driving whilst disqualified including the period of disqualification imposed by his Honour.

4. Otherwise, the sentences imposed by the sentencing judge are quashed and the following sentences are imposed in substitution:

(a)In respect of the offence under s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 committed at the C4 Café, the applicant is sentenced to 3 years imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 17 February 2011 and expiring on 16 February 2013, with a balance of term of 1 year commencing on 17 February 2013 and expiring on 16 February 2014;

(b) In respect of the offence under s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 committed at the Devine Café, the applicant is sentenced to 4 years and 6 months imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 17 May 2011 and expiring on 16 May 2014, with a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months commencing on 17 May 2014 and expiring on 16 November 2015.

		01 May 2013",2013-04-25 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2706864,R v Fahda [2013] NSWCCA 86,"Judgment
1SIMPSON J:  I have read in draft the judgment of Fullerton J, in which the facts and circumstances of the offence have been set out.  While I agree (after considerable hesitation) with the order her Honour proposes (to dismiss the Crown appeal) I wish to state my own reasoning for that conclusion in respect of the grounds numbered 1 and 3.  
2I begin by observing that, as the conviction of the respondent followed a lengthy jury trial, there is no agreed statement of facts.  It was the task of the trial judge to find the facts, in accordance with the evidence, and not inconsistently with the jury's verdict.  In this case, that task included having due regard to the jury's rejection of the defences or partial defences of self-defence (Crimes Act, Pt 11, Div 3), provocation (Crimes Act, s 23) and substantial impairment (Crimes Act, s 23A).
3Harrison J undertook that task.  The evidentiary material placed before this Court was limited.  It did not extend to the transcript of the trial.  To the extent that the grounds of appeal challenge the factual foundations of the sentence, the absence of that material creates a problem for the appellant.
Ground 1: error in finding mid-range objective gravity
4The starting point in considering this ground must be recognition of the principle stated in Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37] and [46].  Assessment of objective seriousness of an offence is the role of the sentencing judge.  While such an assessment is not immune to appellate review, any interference with the findings of the sentencing judge must be founded upon one of the errors specified in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499: acting on a wrong principle, allowing extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the decision, mistake of facts, failure to take into account some material consideration, or production of a result that is unreasonable or plainly unjust, indicative in itself of a failure properly to exercise the power conferred.
5In this case, the assessment of the objective gravity of the murder as lying in the mid-range depended upon an array of factual findings emerging from the evidence, together with an evaluation of the significance of at least some of those facts.  In R v Koloamatangi [2011] NSWCCA 288, at [51] Basten JA (with whom Adams and Johnson JJ agreed) saw the superior position of the trial judge in these circumstances as ""accentuating"" the appellate court's reluctance to interfere in the assessment.  His Honour nevertheless also emphasised the duty of the appellate court to intervene where error is established.
6Undoubtedly, there were features of this offence that pointed to objective seriousness of a high degree.  These were:
(i) the respondent was habitually, and was on the day of the murder, unlawfully armed with a handgun;
(ii) after an encounter with Mr Darwiche, and a conversation in which Mr Darwiche identified himself to the respondent and threatened him, the respondent returned to his vehicle, armed himself with the gun, and approached Mr Darwiche's vehicle;
(iii) the respondent, at short range, fired 12 shots, seven of which entered Mr Darwiche's body, through the open passenger window of the vehicle occupied by Mr Darwiche;
(iv) the respondent's intention was to kill Mr Darwiche.
(v) Mr Darwiche was in a vulnerable position, being seated in the driver's seat of a stationary vehicle, and in no position to make any attempt to escape;
(vi) although the name of Darwiche was obviously known to the respondent, it seems that the two were not previously acquainted.  (The account of the facts accepted by the sentencing judge suggested that the respondent was somewhat taken aback when Mr Darwiche identified himself);
(vii) the respondent had no reason to believe that Mr Darwiche was armed, and, indeed, he was not;
(viii) the shooting took place in a public car park, part of a shopping complex, on a Saturday afternoon, when it could be expected that members of the public, including children and families, would be present; and
(ix) Mr Darwiche's wife and children were in fact present and witnessed the shooting.
7There are some uncontroversial ameliorating relevant circumstances, although these are slight.  These are:
(i) the respondent and Mr Darwiche were present in the car park coincidentally, pursuant to no prearrangement or organisation on either side;
(ii) the shooting was entirely unplanned, unpremeditated and spontaneous on the part of the respondent.
More controversial ameliorating features, although subject to separate grounds of appeal, are the respondent's mental or psychiatric state, and his low level of intellectual functioning.
8The Crown's submissions in respect of this ground appear to propose that three specific errors affected the assessment that the offence fell into the mid-range of objective gravity of offences of the kind.  These were identified as: 
(i) that his Honour erred in relying on certain of the authorities cited to him on behalf of the respondent;
(ii) that his Honour erred in finding provocation for the purposes of s 21A(3)(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Procedure Act"");
(iii) that his Honour erred in having little or no regard for aggravating features identified by the Crown.
9It is necessary to deal with each of these in turn.
(i)  reliance upon authorities
10The authorities to which the Crown referred are R v Shepherd [2006] NSWSC 799; R v Saalfeld [2007] NSWSC 376; R v Cooper [2005] NSWSC 791 and Nguyen v R [2007] NSWCCA 363; 180 A Crim R 267.  
11In the last of these cases, Smart AJ with whom Adams J agreed, said:
""[143]  An intention to kill and premeditation are usual elements in a murder of mid range objective seriousness.""
12It is true, as the Crown contends, that these cases are not authority for any general principle that ""offences without planning will usually fall below the mid-range of objective seriousness"".  Each was an instance of a conviction for murder in which the finding of objective seriousness was below mid-range.  In Shepherd and Saalfeld the findings were, respectively, ""close to the mid-range but below"" and ""slightly less than mid-range"".  In each case that finding resulted from a complex of factors.  In each case, the murder was not planned or premeditated.  Significantly, in each case, the offender was found to have killed with the intention, not of killing, but of causing grievous bodily harm.  The statement by Smart J in Nguyen cannot be converted into an assertion that, where premeditation is absent, the offence cannot be in the mid-range of objective seriousness.  The question is, however, whether the sentencing judge here regarded the cases as authority for such a proposition.  In my opinion he did not.
13The reference to these cases in the Remarks on Sentence was made in the context of his Honour's outline of submissions made on behalf of the Crown and the respondent.  The reference was as follows:
""45  In stark contrast to these submissions, senior counsel for the offender contended that this case was far removed from a worst case example of the crime of murder.  He offered several reasons for this in support of the ultimate submission that the subject offence fell below the mid-range of objective seriousness for murder.  First, there was no premeditation or planning.  Offences without planning will usually fall below the mid-range of objective seriousness ...""
He then cited Shepherd, Saalfeld, and Cooper, and quoted the passage extracted above from Nguyen.
14In my opinion, a fair reading of this paragraph shows that his Honour intended merely to state the submissions advanced on behalf of the respondent.  His Honour at no stage expressly accepted or adopted the proposition that offences without planning will usually fall below the mid-range of objective seriousness.  Nor can it be said that he implicitly accepted or adopted that proposition.  Had he done so, it might have been expected that he would have acceded to the respondent's primary submission, that this offence fell below the mid-range.  He expressly declined to do so.
15The Crown has not established error in this respect.
(ii)  provocation
16In respect of provocation, his Honour made two separate findings - first, that Mr Darwiche said to the respondent words to the effect outlined by the respondent in his evidence (see [17] below), and, second, that that had an effect on the respondent that caused him to lose self-control.  (The concept of loss of self-control is drawn from s 23 of the Crimes Act, which provides, in circumstances it specifies, a partial defence of provocation to a charge of murder which reduces the offence to manslaughter.  No issue was raised in this appeal whether loss of self-control is integral to, or permissible in, consideration of the mitigating feature of provocation under s 21A(3)(c) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, and I express no view on that question.)  It is to be noted that the Crown has not raised, as a discrete ground of appeal, a direct challenge to either of the findings relevant to provocation.  The issue is raised only as part of the challenge to the finding of mid-range objective gravity.
17There are a number of passages in the Remarks on Sentence that deal with the question of provocation.  At [21] the judge referred to a defence submission that the respondent's actions were the result of a loss of self-control brought about by something that Mr Darwiche said to the respondent about the murder of the respondent's brother.  Other references to provocation in the Remarks are:
""[22]  The evidence in my opinion supports a finding that something happened between the offender and the deceased that caused or provoked the offender to act as he did.  It seems apparent that the offender did not take the gun and start shooting immediately upon seeing the deceased.  There were two conversations before that occurred ...
[His Honour then recounted the respondent's evidence concerning a conversation he said he had had with Mr Darwiche, in which Mr Darwiche identified himself by name, and as a result of which the respondent was 'in shock'.  That is the passage quoted in the judgment of Fullerton J.  The respondent said: 'He [Mr Darwiche] threatened my brother Hussein and me.  And he said he's going to kill us the way he killed my brother Ahmed.']
...
[26]  In my opinion it is apparent, and I find, that there was evidence to support a conclusion that there was a degree of provocation, falling short of the partial defence of provocation at law, which directly affects and mitigates an assessment of the objective seriousness of the crime.
...
[30]  In the present case, the words that were uttered to the offender by the deceased, in combination with his particular mental health issues and his perception that the deceased was preventing him from leaving the service station, are circumstances that, although insufficient to constitute an excuse or defence at law, were circumstances that I find amounted to provocation for the purposes of s 21A(3)(c).  I have taken them into account in mitigation of the objective criminality of the offence.
...
[46]  Secondly, there is evidence of a degree of provocation ...
[68]  It is highly likely that the offender's responses to the actual threats that were made to him by the deceased, and the threats that he perceived were being made, such as that the deceased was blocking his exit from the car park, resulted in responses from him that might have been different in a mentally healthy and more intelligent person.  I find that what the deceased said to the offender had an impact on his self-control when this crime was committed.  In making this finding I have had regard to the medical evidence, which I accept as to the offender's psychiatric disorders.  These disorders accounted in part for the impact on the offender's self-control."" (italics added) 
It is clear enough, from these passages, that his Honour found (i) that the respondent had been provoked by Mr Darwiche's conduct; (ii) that the provocation caused some loss of self-control in the respondent; and (iii) that that provocation had a significant bearing upon the assessment of objective seriousness.
18His Honour was conscious that a defence of provocation, under s 23 of the Crimes Act 1900, had been put to the jury and rejected, and that he was bound by that verdict.  That did not preclude a finding of provocation as a mitigating factor for the purposes of s 21A(3)(c) of the Sentencing Procedure Act.  He made express reference to this in para 17, where he mentioned the defence of self-defence and the partial defences of provocation and substantial impairment, all of which had been rejected by the jury, and added:
""Having regard to the way in they were articulated, however, it was clear that there was a significant relationship between each defence and the offender's subjective circumstances, particularly his level of intellectual function and his mental condition.  However, the fact that the jury rejected the defences raised by the offender does not mean that his evidence was rejected or should now be rejected.  Nor does it mean that the factual matters underlying the defences cease to have any significance for present purposes."" 
19The provocation aspect of Ground 1 of the appeal had two limbs.  In the first instance, and notwithstanding the absence of any ground of appeal to this effect, the Crown challenged the finding in paras [22] and [26], that what had happened between the respondent and Mr Darwiche amounted to ""a degree of provocation"".  In this respect, the Crown relied upon short extracts of summaries from the evidence of three witnesses, two of whom observed the encounter between the respondent and Mr Darwiche prior to the shooting.  So far as the extracted evidence goes, neither of those witnesses observed anything in the respondent's demeanour or behaviour that indicated any level of disturbance or discomposure in the respondent following the encounter with Mr Darwiche.  The third witness mentioned was Lisa Darwiche, Mr Darwiche's wife.  As noted above, the transcript of evidence was not put before this Court; nor was the Court taken to any specific evidence other than those short extracts.
20It seems that the Crown relied upon the evidence extracted to support a negative inference - that is, that the respondent was not distressed or disconcerted by the conversation or conversations he had with Mr Darwiche.  That would amount to a challenge to the finding of fact that what Mr Darwiche had said had an impact on the respondent's self-control.  (It does not appear to be a challenge to the respondent's evidence of what Mr Darwiche said, which his Honour clearly accepted.)  An inference of the kind proposed by the Crown is simply not available from the extracts of evidence provided in the written submissions.  There is nothing in the short account of the evidence of Lisa Darwiche contained in the Crown's written submissions that bears in any way upon the existence or otherwise of provocation on the part of her husband, or the effect of his conduct upon the respondent.  Indeed, the Crown's submissions did not go so far as to explain whether the challenge was to the respondent's evidence of what Mr Darwiche had said, or to its effect on the respondent.  His Honour did not, and this Court was not invited to, analyse the basis on which the jury rejected the partial defence of provocation under s 23 of the Crimes Act.  
21A successful challenge to a sentencing judge's finding of fact must be based on more substantial material than was put before this Court.
22The second limb of the Crown's challenge to the provocation finding lay in the weight attributed to it.  All that was said in support of the submission was:
""Even if his Honour was entitled to find some level of provocation established, it was of little consequence and should have carried little weight.""
23It is not possible for this Court to review the evidence relevant to provocation because that evidence has not been put before us, and no comprehensive reference has been made to it.  It would be quite inappropriate, and a denial of procedural fairness to one party or the other (or both) for the Court to make its own inquiries to attempt to locate the evidence relevant to the question, or to draw conclusions without the detailed assistance of submissions.
24What can be said is that the sentencing judge's findings on the level of provocation were somewhat muted.  He said ([26] and [46]) that there was ""a degree of provocation"" - suggesting that the provocation was somewhat limited.  He was conscious that, after the provocative comment was made, the respondent had time to return to his car and drive a distance, before alighting from his car and firing the fatal shots.  Similarly his finding concerning loss of self-control was guarded (as it had to be in light of the jury's rejection of provocation as a partial defence).  It was that Mr Darwiche's words ""had an impact on his self-control"".
25However, in the respondent's favour, his Honour did not compartmentalise the issue of provocation.  In considering objective gravity, he saw the provocation and its effect as intermingled with the respondent's psychiatric disorder ([68]).
26Given the facts accepted by the sentencing judge, I would reject the Crown's proposition (see [22] above).  In my opinion, the sentencing judge was entitled to give the evidence significant weight.  I would reject this criticism of his Honour's findings.
27I would reject this aspect of the challenge to the finding concerning objective seriousness.
(iii)  aggravating features
28The complaint here made by the Crown, that, in assessing objective seriousness, his Honour failed to accord appropriate weight ""to the aggravating circumstances posited by the Crown"", was not articulated or identified with any clarity.  The submissions included:
""This was a case involving deliberate multiple shots from semi automatic pistol in the context of an intention to kill."",
and contained a reference to the presence of women and children in the car park, and that the shooting took place in a public place.  
29Recourse to the submissions placed before his Honour on sentence (that were before this Court) provides little elucidation of what the Crown then put forward as ""aggravating circumstances"".  Reference was made to the respondent's possession and use of a hand gun, and that it was his habit to carry such a weapon.  
30His Honour made express reference to this submission in [43] of his Remarks.  
31In my opinion, his Honour dealt adequately and appropriately with matters that were put to him in respect of aggravating features.  No reference was made either at sentencing or on appeal to any item in the s 21A(2) catalogue of aggravating features that was relevant or overlooked, and my own examination of that catalogue shows that there is none.  Many of the features there listed are integral to the offence of murder, and therefore not, in the circumstances of a charge of murder, aggravating.  None of the specific errors asserted by the Crown are made out.
32The Crown's attempt to identify specific error within the House principle therefore fails.  That leaves open the final question, whether the result itself shows that the assessment of objective gravity was ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"", indicative in itself of a failure properly to perform the task of assessing the objective seriousness of the offence.  
33Even taking into account the ameliorating circumstances, absent what his Honour found to be provocation, the offence would be at a very high level of objective gravity.  The question therefore is whether the conduct of Mr Darwiche was such as to permit a finding that what was otherwise a very objectively serious instance of murder could be classified as one within the mid-range of objective gravity.  Although his Honour did not frame it in this way, it seems that he accepted that Mr Darwiche taunted the respondent with the fact of his brother's murder by Mr Darwiche's brother, and combined that with a threat to murder both the respondent and another brother of his.  
34In the circumstances, bearing in mind the Mulato principle, and with some reservation, I accept that it was open to the sentencing judge to reach the conclusion that he did.  
35I therefore agree, somewhat reluctantly, that ground 1 should fail.
Ground 3: intellectual disadvantage
36The finding to which challenge is made under this ground is as follows:
""16  [The respondent] has a very low emotional intelligence, is severely intellectually disadvantaged and lacks insight into his condition, which he has never learned effectively to manage.""
37The Crown contention was that such a finding was not open.  It is therefore necessary to examine the relevant evidence.  It derives from psychological and psychiatric reports tendered at trial, and others prepared for sentencing purposes.  The first report is of Professor David Greenberg, a forensic psychiatrist, who on 23 August 2011 reported for the purpose of commenting on possible legal defences ""with regard to his mental state and possible psychiatric difficulties"".  In that report Dr Greenberg referred to 1996 intelligence testing which found the respondent to be ""of low average intelligence"", and to subsequent 2000 testing when the respondent was found to be ""in the borderline intellectual functioning range"".  In his diagnosis, Dr Greenberg accepted that the respondent was of ""borderline intellectual functioning"".  Dr Greenberg reported twice subsequently, on 30 August 2011 and 1 November 2011.  He did not change the views he had previously expressed.
38Mr Sam Borenstein reported to the respondent's solicitors on 17 March 2011, having administered a series of psychological tests.  He recorded the respondent's verbal and performance intelligence as being in the second percentile range, and ""extremely low"".  His verbal comprehension was found to be in the third percentile range, but still ""extremely low"", as was perceptual organisation and working memory index.  Mr Borenstein said:
""Mr Fahda is a man of extremely low intelligence.  Mr Fahda's reading age is no better than ten years eight months.  His intelligence is no better than the second percentile, compared to aged peers, ie 98% of Mr Fahda's aged peers perform at higher intellectual level than he, which places him at significant disadvantage intellectually.  Mr Fahda has a very low emotional intelligence.  He lacks insight with regards to the nature of his illness, and has never effectively learned to manage same ... Mr Fahda is compromised both in terms of intellectual disability and psychiatric impairment ...""
39A psychiatrist, Dr Olav Nielssen, reported to the respondent's solicitors.  On 30 March 2011, he said:
""My impression, based on a single interview, was that Mr Fahda understood the charge and was able to respond to the charge, understood the general nature of the proceedings, was aware of the procedure followed in adversarial legal proceedings, and was capable of understanding legal advice given to him in simple terms and was able to provide reliable instructions based on that advice.  Hence in my opinion he is fit to enter a plea and is fit for trial.""
40In a report dated 29 November 2011, he said:
""My impression from the evidence he gave during the trial was that Mr Fahda's intelligence was within the normal range ...""
The Crown challenge to the finding was based upon the passage extracted from Dr Nielssen's report in which he recorded his ""impression"" from the evidence given by the respondent in the trial.  An ""impression"" is slight counter to the careful and scientific tests administered by Mr Borenstein.  
41I agree with Fullerton J that his Honour's finding that the respondent was severely intellectually disadvantaged was amply open to him.  I would reject this ground of appeal.  
42I agree with Fullerton J in respect of the remaining grounds of appeal.  
43As indicated above, I agree with the orders proposed by Fullerton J.
44FULLERTON J:  On 13 September 2011 the respondent was convicted by a jury of the murder of Abdul Darwiche.  On 24 February 2012 he was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 14 years, to commence on 28 September 2009 and to expire on 27 September 2023, with a balance of term of 6 years to expire on 27 September 2029.
45The maximum penalty for murder is life imprisonment to which a standard non-parole period of 20 years applies.  This is an appeal from that sentence by the Crown pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  
46The grounds of appeal relied upon by the Crown are as follows:Ground 1: His Honour erred in finding that the offence fell within the mid range of objective seriousness.
Ground 2: His Honour erred in finding that:(a) ""the offender is a good candidate for rehabilitation and has good prospects of not reoffending""; and(b) ""there are no apparent countervailing factors that suggest that reoffending is likely"".
Ground 3: His Honour erred in finding that the respondent was ""severely intellectually disadvantaged"".
Ground 4: His Honour erred in his approach to the respondent's mental illness.
Ground 5: His Honour erred by failing to impose a sentence that reflected the objective gravity of the offence and the aggravating factors and was manifestly inadequate.
The evidence for sentencing purposes 
47The appeal was argued referable to the sentencing judge's summary of the facts of the murder together with some additional background information, about which there was no dispute.   The incident
[2]  There was little if any relevant dispute about the facts at the trial and the offender admitted at least the following matters.  At about 2.30pm on Saturday 14 March 2009 the victim Abdul Darwiche went to eat with his family at the Paradise Cuisine restaurant situated at a small shopping complex on the corner of the Hume Highway and Miller Road at Bass Hill.  The complex included a United Petroleum service station.  He drove there in his green Mitsubishi Triton 4WD vehicle and parked outside the pharmacy. Members of his family had arrived there earlier. 
[3]  Shortly after 3.00pm the offender drove his silver Honda CRV into the service station and parked it near some petrol bowsers.  He alighted and went into the shop to purchase some items.  He returned to his vehicle and moved it to another location directly outside a Subway restaurant at the side of the service station.  A short time after that the offender moved the vehicle to another location closer to the corner of the Hume Highway and Miller Road.  The offender had arranged to meet another person at the service station.  That person arrived driving a black Jeep. 
[4]  At about this time the deceased left the restaurant and walked to his vehicle.  Other members of his family also went to the vehicles in which they had travelled to the restaurant, which were parked in the car park.  The deceased was seated in his vehicle when the offender alighted from his vehicle and started walking in the direction of the deceased.  The deceased in turn left his vehicle and walked towards the offender.  The two men came together somewhere between the two vehicles.  There was a short conversation between them before they each returned to their respective vehicles. 
[5]  The offender proceeded to drive his vehicle forward towards the Miller Road exit of the service station.  At the same time the deceased reversed his vehicle out of its parked position and also drove towards the Miller Road exit.  As the vehicles approached the exit they stopped, so that the vehicle driven by the offender was positioned adjacent to the passenger side of the deceased's vehicle.  The offender alighted from his vehicle, walked to the passenger side of the deceased's vehicle, and produced a semi-automatic pistol.  He then fired several shots from that pistol through the passenger side of the deceased's vehicle, hitting the deceased seven times, predominantly on the left hand side of his body.  The deceased's vehicle then travelled from the service station on to Miller Road and across a median strip into a reserve where it collided with a tree.  The offender got back into his vehicle, turned right into Miller Road and drove away.  The deceased died at the scene as a result of the bullet wounds that he received.  Ballistics evidence established that the weapon that killed the deceased had been fired a total of 12 times. 
Additional background 
[6]  The Fahda family is associated with the Razzak family.  Between 2001 and 2004 a number of murders and shootings took place involving members of the Razzak, Fahda and Darwiche families.  As a result of this conflict, a number of members of these families are either dead or in gaol.  On 30 October 2003, Ahmed Fahda, the brother of the offender, was shot and killed by two gunmen at a service station in Punchbowl.  Adnan Darwiche, the brother of the deceased, was charged with soliciting to murder in relation to that killing. 
[7]  Two other people were charged in relation to that murder.  Adnan Darwiche was subsequently acquitted but is otherwise serving life sentences in relation to shootings and murders associated with this conflict. 
The interrelationship between the grounds of appeal 
48The first three grounds of appeal concern what are said to be errors in the assessment of the facts material to the application of a number of sentencing principles raised by the evidence led at trial and on sentence, including the evidence relevant to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence (Ground 1); the respondent's prospects of rehabilitation (Ground 2); and the extent of his intellectual impairment or disadvantage (Ground 3).  Ground 4 concerns what is said to be a discrete error of law in his Honour's approach to the respondent's mental illness, while Ground 5 contends that for a murder of the objective gravity of this offence, accompanied with what the Crown submitted were features of aggravation, the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate.
49Although each of the grounds of appeal were addressed separately in the Crown's written submissions, at the hearing of the appeal it became apparent that there was some overlap in the evidence relevant to whether there was error in his Honour's assessment of objective seriousness (Ground 1) and in his Honour's approach to that evidence on the question whether the Crown had made good its challenge to the inadequacy of the sentence (Ground 5). 
50In addition, while the Crown maintained the submission in support of Ground 3 that the expert evidence did not support a finding that the respondent was ""severely intellectually disadvantaged"" - a finding his Honour made when dealing with the respondent's subjective circumstances- she did not challenge his Honour's description of the respondent as a person of ""limited intelligence"" when considering the interrelationship between the respondent's psychiatric, psychological and intellectual disabilities or the extent to which they were causally connected with the commission of the offence, and of ""low intelligence"" on the question of remorse and special circumstances.  The Crown's ultimate submission was that, irrespective of the way his Honour described the respondent's level of cognitive or intellectual functioning, undue weight was given to it as a factor contributing to his loss of self-control when he discharged the gun intending to kill the deceased.  This, she submitted, when coupled with his Honour's failure to give appropriate weight to the fact that the murder was accompanied by an intention to kill, and by the undue weight given to the mitigating influence of what his Honour was satisfied was some provocative conduct on the part of the deceased, was productive of error in the objective seriousness of the offence being positioned in the mid range. 
51These evaluative errors were then said by the Crown to be compounded by a number of errors in his Honour's approach to the respondent's mental illness as comprehended by the fourth ground of appeal.  These were particularised to include a failure to make a finding adverse to the respondent on the grounds of future dangerousness and wrongly concluding that that the respondent's psychiatric condition rendered issues of general deterrence and specific deterrence of no weight in the sentencing exercise.  The Crown maintained the submission in support of Ground 2 that the finding that the respondent had ""good prosects of rehabilitation"" was not open on the evidence, and that the weight given to that factor in mitigation of sentence also contributed to the imposition of an inadequate sentence.
The issues at trial
52At his trial the respondent gave evidence that he shot (and killed) the deceased but that he should be acquitted of murder on the ground of self-defence.  In the alternative, it was submitted on his behalf that should the jury regard his defensive response in shooting the deceased as excessive, he should be convicted of manslaughter.  Further, in the alternative, the partial defences of provocation under s 23 of the Crimes Act 1900 and substantial impairment under s 23A of the Crimes Act were relied upon to reduce his liability for the killing from murder to manslaughter.  
53The evidence relevant to self-defence and provocation were the only matters in dispute at trial.  By contrast, the evidence relevant to the respondent's psychiatric profile and mental functioning at the time of the murder was not in dispute.  Whether the respondent's mental condition impaired him to such a degree as would justify his liability being reduced from murder to manslaughter was, however, the subject of considerable argument in counsels' closing submissions at trial.  
54Dr Greenberg gave evidence for the Crown and Dr Nielssen for the defence.  On sentence the Crown also relied upon a supplementary report from Dr Greenberg limited to the question of the respondent's likely response to treatment as bearing upon the assessment of future dangerousness.  The defence relied upon reports by two clinical psychologists directed principally to his intellectual capacity and functioning.  
55The evidence of the forensic psychiatrists supported a range of diagnoses including post-traumatic stress disorder associated with hyper vigilance, paranoia, auditory hallucinations, depression and an inverted sleep pattern with a probable underlying psychosis.  
56By its verdict the jury must be taken to have been satisfied that the Crown had discharged the onus of negativing that the respondent shot the deceased in self-defence and/or under provocation.  They must also have concluded that he failed to discharge the onus of establishing, on the balance of probabilities, either that his capacity to judge whether his actions were right or wrong or to control himself was substantially impaired (as provided for in s 23A(1)(a) of the Crimes Act) or they were not satisfied that such impairment as was revealed by the evidence warranted his liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter under the second limb of the statutory test in s 23A(1)(b).  His Honour found the latter more probable given the uncontradicted medical evidence.
57It was submitted on behalf of the respondent, and accepted as a correct statement of principle by the sentencing judge, that the evidence led in proof of the defences at trial, including the respondent's evidence on the question of self-defence and provocation and the expert medical evidence relevant to the partial defence of substantial impairment, continued to have relevance for sentencing purposes.  The Crown did not submit otherwise either on sentence or on appeal.  
58The challenge mounted by the Crown on the appeal was to the weight his Honour apparently afforded his findings on the issue of provocation and substantial impairment when assessing both the objective seriousness of the murder and, ultimately, in the sentence imposed. 
The respondent's subjective circumstances 
59When considering the respondent's subjective circumstances his Honour noted the connection between the issue of provocation and the respondent's psychiatric profile, including his level of intellectual functioning.  
60His Honour made the following findings as to the respondent's subjective circumstances (only one of which was challenged by the Crown), namely the finding in [16] below that the respondent was ""severely intellectually disadvantaged"":[8]  I find the following facts to have been established on the balance of probabilities.  The offender was born in April 1987 and so was 21 at the time of the events that give rise to these proceedings.  He was 24 at the time of the trial.  He is the fifth of six children, of whom four are still alive.  He has a half-brother from his father's subsequent relationship.  His parents are of Sunni Muslim heritage from North Lebanon and came to Australia when he was very young.  He had no memory of living in Lebanon.  
[9]  There is a family history of mental illness.  One of the offender's brothers had been admitted to hospital for treatment for schizophrenia.  His sister had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.  His father also had some unspecified psychiatric problems.  The offender's own early development would appear to have been normal until shortly before he came into contact with a mental health service following an incident in which his father stabbed his mother in the family home.  He was about eight at the time.  His father was sentenced to imprisonment for a number of years.  The offender had an understandable emotional reaction to all of this.  He was subsequently teased about it at school, which led to anger management problems.  This in turn led to continuing trouble at school and his regular school attendance was interrupted.  He saw a psychiatrist on several occasions during 1998 and 1999.  
[10]  While his mother was recovering, the offender went to live with his older brother.  He remains angry at the way he was treated while in his brother's care.  During this period he was beaten and witnessed significant violent events both inside and outside the home.  The offender attended Birrong, Lakemba and Granville Primary Schools and was sexually abused by a school principal when he was about 10.  In approximately August 1998 the school counsellor at Birrong Primary School recorded the following entry in a file maintained with respect to the offender: ""Would you please forward this file to counsellor at Granville P.S. It has been requested because Mohammed is not functioning well in the classroom and has significant anger outbursts. I have spoken to the school counsellor about Mohammed's emotional difficulties coping with his father being in gaol. Mohammed expresses a lot of frustration because he is not supposed to talk about the family situation and still misses his father."" 
The offender was aged only eleven years at the date of this entry. 
[11]  He completed Year 7 at Birrong Boys' High School and later attended Punchbowl Boys' High School from which he was expelled at the age of 14.  When he was in Year 8 he went to live with his father following his father's release from prison but he did not get on with him.  He was living with his father in 2003 when his brother was murdered.  After his brother died he was prescribed antipsychotic medication by a psychiatrist from the local mental health service.  He had begun to hear voices and see things at this time.  He did not leave the house for two years and developed a severe depressive illness.  Pre-existing auditory hallucinations worsened. Moreover, he developed frank paranoid ideation, which was an extension of a traumatic stress reaction in the context of a strong biological propensity towards psychosis given the family history of schizophrenia. 
[12]  Following his brother's death, the offender took it upon himself to protect the family.  He moved back to his mother's house approximately one month later.  He stayed awake at night and would only sleep when his mother and sisters had arisen.  He made sure that all of the windows and doors were locked and he remained vigilant, watchful and wary.  The offender was subject to ideas of reference, which was an extension of his paranoid illness.  This worsened in adolescence and young adulthood. 
[13]  Following his brother's death the offender commenced abusing cocaine. This started at the age of 16 and continued until he came to prison.  The offender spent eight months in gaol between December 2007 and July 2008 awaiting trial for assault but was ultimately acquitted.  Whilst in custody at that time he was stabbed and seriously wounded.  He spent time in hospital recovering from his wounds and a subsequent infection.  Following this the offender suffered from increased paranoid ideation and made a direct connection between this incident and his brother's murder.  The offender went back to live with his mother following his release.  He received no appropriate mental health care. 
[14]  The offender began carrying a pistol with him at all times for his protection after his release.  He has had an indifferent employment history and has effectively never worked in any form of regular or full-time employment.  He is untrained and unskilled in any vocational setting.  
[15]  The offender is of below average intelligence.  Psychological testing revealed him to have a verbal and performance intelligence in only the second percentile range.  Overall intelligence was tested in the first percentile range.  He was found to be easily distracted, consistent with paranoia.  His alienation scores showed him to have an unsatisfactory emotional life, to be suspicious, sensitive and anxious, and to feel unaccepted and alienated with a denial of normal expression.  His scores were associated with personality characteristics evidenced by unusual thoughts, periodic anxieties, and difficulties relating to others, as well as with feelings of isolation, estrangement and loneliness.  These are in keeping with his personal history. 
[16]  The offender has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and paranoid schizophrenia in the context of an extremely low intelligence. There is a family history of psychotic illness as well.  His psychiatric illness is of long standing and predates the offence for which he is being sentenced.  He has a very low emotional intelligence, is severely intellectually disadvantaged and lacks insight into his condition, which he has never learned effectively to manage. 
Ground 1: His Honour erred in finding that the offence fell within the mid range of objective seriousness
61The Crown submitted that despite the fact that the evidence supported a finding that the killing was spontaneous and unpremeditated, and that it occurred quickly in the context of a chance meeting at a location unconnected to either the respondent or the deceased, it remained a brutal and intentional killing of considerable objective gravity committed in circumstances of aggravation.  This, it was submitted, necessitated positioning the offence well above the mid range of objective seriousness.  (A submission advanced on sentence that a life sentence was warranted was not pressed.)  
62In concluding that the offence fell within the mid range of objective seriousness, his Honour relied upon the following factors:(i) It was spontaneous and unplanned;(ii) It was not associated with any gratuitous violence beyond that which was instrumental in causing the death of the deceased; and(iii) The formation of the intention to kill was influenced by the provocative conduct of the deceased.
63The Crown submitted that his Honour was led into error in his assessment of objective seriousness by an uncritical acceptance of a line of authority which was relied upon by defence counsel as exemplifying the proposition that offences without planning usually fall below the mid range.  The cases are cited in his Honour's judgment at [45] as follows: R v Shepherd [2006] NSWSC 799 at [49] - [50], [61] and [65]; R v Saalfeld [2007] NSWSC 376 at [24]; and R v Cooper [2005] NSWSC 791 at [103].
64The only reference his Honour made to these authorities in his sentencing remarks (and only then by a citation of them) was when summarising defence counsel's submission that far from the offence being a worst case example of murder, as submitted by the Crown, it was appropriately positioned below the mid range.  The absence of premeditation or planning was identified by defence counsel as the first of three significant features of an offence below the mid range (the second and third features being a degree of provocation and the absence of gratuitous violence or cruelty).  Although, as noted, his Honour ultimately found that these three features, in combination, operated to appoint the objective seriousness of the murder in the mid range, it is clear that he did not accede to defence counsel's submission that absence of premeditation placed the offending below the mid range, still less uncritically accept the authorities to which defence counsel referred and to which exception is taken.  
65I am not satisfied that his Honour was led into error in the way contended for by the Crown.  For that reason I do not consider it is necessary to decide whether counsel's reliance on the authorities for the submission he advanced was wrong or overstated.
66The Crown was also critical of what was said to be his Honour's misplaced reliance on the observations of Smart AJ in Nguyen v R [2007] NSWCCA 363; 180 A Crim R 267 in appointing the offending in the mid range (also relied upon by defence counsel) where at [143] Smart AJ said:An intention to kill and premeditation are usual elements in a murder of mid range objective seriousness.  
67This was said by the Crown to be contrary to R v Nelson (Court of Criminal Appeal, 25 June 1996, unreported); R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 112; 153 A Crim R 257; R v Hillsley [2006] NSWCCA 312; 164 A Crim R 252 at [16]-[17]; and Versluys v R [2008] NSWCCA 76 at [32], cases where this Court has held that an intention to kill and premeditation would be expected to place an offence above the mid range of objective seriousness.  
68Senior counsel for the respondent submitted, correctly in my view, that each of the cases relied on by the Crown is to the effect that absence of an intention to kill does not necessarily mean that the offence is less serious, and that none of them is authority for the proposition for which the Crown contends.  
69In Hillsley, where the Court referred to both Nelson and Wilson, the following was said:[16]  Although it will generally be the case that an intention to cause grievous bodily harm is less culpable to a greater or lesser degree than an intention to kill, this is not always the case.  In R v Nelson (unreported, NSWCCA 25 June 1996) McInerney J said (Gleeson CJ and Studdert J agreeing) that ""there are circumstances where an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm could reflect similar criminality to other cases involving an intention to kill""; see also R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA [112].
70The Court went on to hold that where death resulted from a premeditated vicious attack of extreme violence on the victim in his own home, the fact that finding that an intention to kill could not be established beyond reasonable doubt did not significantly mitigate the gravity of the offence.
71In Versluys, McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Simpson and Price JJ agreed) rejected a submission that the sentencing judge failed to consider the significance of the fact that there was no intention to kill by observing as follows:[32]  In Apps v R [2006] NSWCCA 290 Simpson J (at [49]) stated that the state of mind in which an offence is committed is a relevant consideration to the assessment of the criminality in relation to the offence of murder.  However, her Honour stressed that it is not the only circumstance relevant to that assessment.  Although where there is an intention to kill the objective seriousness of the offence is likely to be greater, it does not follow that where the intention is confined to an intention to cause grievous bodily harm that the objective seriousness will fall below the mid range (see Apps per Hunt JA at [4]). 
...
[34]  It may be accepted that a murder which is not premeditated would usually be less serious than one which involves planning.  However murder is a crime which can be committed under a very wide range of circumstances and the absence of premeditation does not dictate a finding that the objective seriousness of the particular offence falls below the mid range.
72Since there was no suggestion of any premeditation in the murder of the deceased, the emphasis on the conjunction between an intent to kill and premeditation in the cases to which the Crown referred does not appear to me to be an issue of principle that falls to be resolved on the appeal.
73The Crown's primary submission in support of the first ground of appeal was that the factual findings his Honour made favourable to the respondent in assessing mid range offending were given undue weight and those adverse to him not given any, or sufficient, weight such as to result in a sentencing error.  Central amongst what were said to be the erroneously weighted considerations was his Honour's finding on the issue of provocation (the third factor identified by his Honour as supporting a finding of mid range objective seriousness) and the related issue of the impact of the respondent's intellectual disabilities on his loss of self-control.  
74Each of the defences raised at trial were considered for sentencing purposes but only the evidence relating to provocation and substantial impairment were said to be material.  Although the respondent had given evidence that he shot the deceased because he thought he was going to be shot, his Honour was not persuaded that there was any element of self-defence involved in the shooting, there being no evidence that the deceased was armed with a firearm or that he presented any immediate threat of personal physical danger or harm to the respondent. 
75His Honour was satisfied that there was a degree of provocation in the encounter between the respondent and the deceased which amounted to provocation for the purposes of s 21A(3)(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which, in combination with the mental health issues informing the respondent's perception that the deceased was preventing him from leaving the petrol station, was available to be taken into account in mitigation of the objective criminality of the offence.  
76His Honour referred extensively to the respondent's evidence at trial, together with the evidence of the officer in charge and Dr Nielssen: [22] The evidence in my opinion supports a finding that something happened between the offender and the deceased that caused or provoked the offender to act as he did. It seems apparent that the offender did not take the gun and start shooting immediately upon seeing the deceased. There were two conversations before that occurred. In this respect I observe that the offender gave evidence that the deceased said words to him that contained or amounted to a threat. For example, the offender gave evidence as follows: ""Q. What did you do then? A. He started to approach me and that's when I approached him. 
Q. Do you know exactly where you met? A. Halfway between, halfway between, like. 
Q. What was said between you at that stage - withdraw that. First of all, did you know that that man was Abdul Darwiche? A. No. 
Q. Did he say something to you? A. When he got there? 
Q. Yeah. A. He asked me, he asked me ""is my name Mohammed Fahda?"" I said ""yes."" I said to him ""what's your name?"" He said ""I'm Abdul Darwiche."" 
Q. What did you do then? A. I was in shock. 
Q. What do you mean you were in shock? A. You hear the name and you hear the description but you don't think it will actually happen, like. I never think, like, I would really bump into him. 
Q. So what happened next? A. He said a few things then he went back to his car, and that's when I went back to my car. 
Q. What language was this conversation in? A. Arabic. 
Q. When you say ""he said a few things"" what did he say, can you remember? A. He threatened my brother Hussein and me. And he said he's going to kill us the way he killed my brother Ahmed. 
Q. Did he say that in Arabic? A. Yes, in Arabic."" 
[23]  The offender had earlier given a version of what occurred to Dr Greenberg and Dr Nielssen that included a claim that the deceased had threatened to kill him. 
[24]  There is also evidence of the relevant history between the Fahda and Darwiche families. This included the undisputed evidence of pre-existing animosity over many years, the murder of the offender's brother by men associated with the Darwiche family and evidence of the deceased's reputation for violence, and his propensity to carry firearms and shoot people in public places that was known to the police and the wider community. This was apparent from the evidence given by Det Oxford in cross-examination as follows: ""Q. Mr Oxford, is it fair to say that the deceased in the case that the jury is dealing with, the man Abdul Darwiche, was suspected by police to have been involved in a large number of shooting incidents? A. Yes, certainly he was charged with two shootings. 
Q. In that context, did he, that is the deceased, Abdul Darwiche, have a reputation for violence? A. Yes. 
Q. That was a reputation known to the police? A. Yes. 
Q. It was also a reputation known within the wider community? A. Yes. 
Q. And particularly the Lebanese, middle eastern community? A. Middle eastern community, yes. 
***** 
Q. That computer contains information including warnings to help police in doing their job? A. Yes. 
Q. It includes warnings about when people are considered to be dangerous if approached? A. Yes. 
Q. Abdul Darwiche, the deceased in this case, was a person for whom such a warning would be given to any police officer approaching him, is that correct? A. Yes. 
Q. The warning is a little more specific in that it will also warn the officers if the person may be expected to be carrying a gun? A. Yes. 
Q. In relation to the deceased, Abdul Darwiche, the computer certainly would have warned any officer approaching him that he may well be carrying a gun? A. Yes, it did. 
Q. I think you are in charge of a number of investigations into shootings by members of the Darwiche family and associates of theirs? A. Yes, and other families. 
Q. The family of Razzak was a family known to have an ongoing dispute with the Darwiche family, correct? A. Yes, that's correct. 
Q. And the Fahda family was associated with the Razzak family? A. Yes. 
Q. The Darwiche family were known to possess firearms? A. Yes. 
Q. That includes Abdul Darwiche? A. Yes."" 
[25]  The medical evidence also established that the offender had psychiatric complaints that affected his ability to control himself. Dr Nielssen gave this evidence on that issue: ""Q. Did you come to the conclusion that Mr Fahda's abnormal state of mind affected his perception of events? A. Yes, I did. 
Q. And that it seemed that he interpreted a chance meeting with Mr Darwiche, and comments made by Mr Darwiche and his hurrying back to the car and then perceiving him to block his exit, as being dangerous to him? A. Yes. He's got an altered perception of events because he has a heightened perception of threat and sees more danger in commonplace events than another person might. 
Q. ... Did you form the opinion that those things affected his capacity to understand events? A. Yes. In the same way as I described a moment ago, in the heightened perception of threat. 
Q. I think you agree with Dr Greenberg that those conditions may have or did affect his ability to control himself? A. Yes. In the sense that if you're in that acutely fearful state your tendency to act on impulse or without thinking is greater than a person who wasn't affected in that way."" 
[26]  In my opinion it is apparent, and I find, that there was evidence to support a conclusion that there was a degree of provocation, falling short of the partial defence of provocation at law, which directly affects and mitigates an assessment of the objective seriousness of the crime. 
77At the hearing of the appeal the Crown conceded that despite the evidence of other witnesses to the shooting which contradicted the respondent's account, it was open to his Honour to find, on the probabilities, that there was some provocative conduct of the deceased in his encounter with the respondent.  His Honour expressed that finding in the following way:[62]  I find that there was an element of provocation. People associated with the deceased had murdered the offender's brother. The deceased spoke to the offender at the scene immediately before he was killed and threatened him in direct and forceful terms. I find that these factors influenced the offender in the formation of his intention to kill the deceased and caused him to suffer a significant loss of his self-control.
78His Honour did not expressly consider how a finding that the deceased's conduct caused the respondent to suffer a significant loss of self control, influencing his intention to kill, was consistent with the jury having rejected the partial defence of provocation.  He must, however, have been satisfied that the jury accepted that the evidence left open the reasonable possibility that the respondent lost self control by reason of the deceased's conduct, and formed an intention to kill (the first limb of the provocation defence in s 23(2) of the Crimes Act) but were satisfied that the conduct of the deceased in threatening to kill the respondent and his brother was not such as would have caused an ordinary person (in the respondent's position) to have so far lost self control as to have formed the intention to kill (the second limb).
79In the same extract his Honour appeared, on one reading, to take into account that people associated with the deceased had murdered the respondent's brother as part of the circumstances amounting to provocation.  Section 21A(2)(c) provides that provocation, as a mitigating factor for sentencing purposes, is limited to where the offender was provoked by the victim.  If, however, the reference to the murder of the respondent's brother was intended by his Honour as supplying context to the respondent's state of mind when the deceased threatened to kill him and his brother - in the sense that it made his perception of the threat more real - then there is no error in the application of the section.  The Crown did not submit there was error of that kind and, for my part, I find none.   
80Finally, the Crown did not submit that there was any error in his Honour having regard to the respondent's limited intelligence and his underlying mental health issues on the question of whether, and to what extent, the shooting was accompanied by a loss of self-control, or that in so doing his Honour's approach was contrary to Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 where at [27] the Court emphasised the necessity for the objective seriousness of an offence to be determined without reference to the personal attributes of an offender but wholly by reference to the nature of the offending.  Rather, the Crown submitted that such provocation as the respondent was confronted with in his encounter with the deceased was of such little weight in evaluating the objective seriousness of an intentional killing of an unarmed man that a finding of mid range offending was not open and that this was so irrespective of the fact that the respondent's compromised intellectual capabilities contributed to a loss of self-control.
81As to the interrelationship between the provocative conduct of the deceased and the respondent's intellectual capabilities, his Honour said at [68]:...It is highly likely that the offender's responses to the actual threats that were made to him by the deceased, and the threats that he perceived were being made, such as that the deceased was blocking his exit from the car park, resulted in responses from him that might have been different in a mentally healthy and more intelligent person.  I find that what the deceased said to the offender had an impact on his self-control and that there was a considerable loss of self-control when this crime was committed...
82Although these findings were made in the context of his Honour considering the relevance of the respondent's psychiatric, psychological and intellectual disabilities for the purpose of assessing the sentence to be ultimately imposed, it is clear from his Honour's approach to the question of assessment of objective seriousness of the offence that he treated the respondent's limited intelligence and his underlying mental condition as a factor which contributed to the way he reacted to the deceased's provocative conduct. 
83The Crown also relied upon the respondent's use of a semi-automatic pistol in an area frequented by the public and that the fatal shooting occurred in the presence of the deceased's wife, children and other family members as aggravating the objective seriousness of the murder and of considerable countervailing weight to those factors which operated in mitigation of it, including the issue of provocation. 
84His Honour made express reference to the emphasis the Crown placed upon the respondent's use of a handgun, and the Crown's submission that the possession and use of handguns should not be tolerated, as features of the offence which should be given weight in the assessment of objective seriousness.  As to the respondent's use of a handgun, his Honour said:...I accept that the fact that the offender had for some years customarily armed himself with the very pistol that caused the death is a factor about which the courts should speak in unambiguous denunciation and to which regard must be had in sentencing this offender.  By the same token, that weapon had not previously been used to cause death or commit a crime, but was carried as a function of the offender's response to his paranoid and hyper-vigilant perception of threat.
85Consistent with his finding that the shooting was spontaneous and impulsive (which was not challenged by the Crown on the appeal) and in light of the medical evidence where the respondent's paranoia and hyper-vigilance were identified as features of his psychiatric profile (and that his being armed on the day of the murder was explained by that fact), in my view, it was open to his Honour to ameliorate the weight of the respondent's use of a handgun as an aggravating factor. 
86As to the other features of aggravation relied upon by the Crown his Honour found as follows: [65]  I acknowledge that the offence took place in public and in the presence of the deceased's family and that the death was the result of an aggressive and violent act.  However, the whole incident unfolded and concluded in a very short space of time. It is conspicuously adorned with limited informative contemporaneous, as opposed to historical, detail. 
87In light of these findings, the Crown's submission that his Honour made no reference to the fact that the shooting occurred in a public place (other than to note the Crown's submission that the case involved a cold-blooded execution in a public place) must be rejected.  The Crown's further submission that his Honour dealt with the fact that the shooting occurred in the presence of the deceased's family solely by reference to defence counsel's submission that this was ameliorated because it was ""a spontaneous response to a chance meeting"" and that ""the offender denied in cross-examination that he saw the children"" is also unsupportable given the same extract. 
88In his sentencing remarks his Honour made particular mention of the Crown's description of the killing as a ""cold-blooded execution"", and other epithets used variously by the Crown to describe the killing including ""atrocious"", ""detestable"", ""hateful"", ""odious"", ""gravely reprehensible"" and ""extremely wicked"", as unhelpful.  In that regard his Honour said at [64]:...There can be no doubt that any death of an unsuspecting and innocent person will necessarily invite descriptions that reflect very critically and pejoratively upon the perpetrator, but all of the circumstances of the case need to be considered.
89The Crown's oral and written submission on the appeal that but for the respondent's subjective circumstances, the killing would have been ""a cold-blooded execution in a public place using a semi-automatic gun"" was also unhelpful and, in light of his Honour's remarks, should not have been repeated, if for no other reason than the term ""execution"" is suggestive of pre-planning and deliberation and, as the Crown conceded, in this case there was no evidence of either.  
90At the hearing of the appeal the Crown acknowledged the broad discretion afforded a sentencing judge in finding the facts and drawing inferences from those facts as part of the evaluative task of characterising the objective seriousness of an offence as classically within the role of the sentencing judge and with which this Court rarely interferes in the absence of a finding of error.  As this Court has said, and repeatedly, where there is a challenge to a sentencing judge's characterisation of objective seriousness, the question is whether the finding was open, which is to be resolved without any different view of the facts members of the reviewing Court might hold intruding into that consideration.  
91In R v KB; R v JL; R v RJB [2011] NSWCCA 190 at [51] Bathurst CJ referred to the frequently cited statement of principle by Spigelman CJ in Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 where his Honour said:...In Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 Spigelman CJ stated the position as follows (at [37]): ""Characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in performing the task of finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts.  This Court is very slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion.  The question must be whether or not the particular characterisation which her Honour gave to the circumstances of the offence was open to her Honour."" 
92His Honour also referred to the views of Simpson J in Mulato where the strict limits within which appellate review of a finding of objective seriousness is undertaken was emphasised (a view with which Adams J agreed at [70]).  At [46] of Mulato Simpson J said:The assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence is quintessentially for the sentencing judge.  It is, if not a finding of fact, then the exercise of an evaluative process akin to fact finding or the exercise of a discretion.  As such it is reviewable in this Court only on the principles stated in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55CLR 499.  The importance of respecting the role of a first instance judge should never be underestimated.  It is not the function of this Court to substitute its own view of objective seriousness for that of the first instance judge.  That is not because objective seriousness is something determined by reference to the evaluation of the credibility of witnesses, in respect of which it is conventionally held that the first instance judge is in a superior position.  It is because it is a fundamental aspect of the appellate system.  Each judicial officer in the hierarchy has his or her own function, and those at appellate level need to take care not to trespass upon the role of those at first instance.
93In R v KB Bathurst CJ regarded her Honour's views as particularly apposite in the case of an offence which can occur in a wide variety of different circumstances.  While the Court in R v KB was concerned with the offence of aggravated break, enter and steal, the circumstances in which a murder is committed are also notoriously diverse.  Bathurst CJ went on to say in [53]: ...That is not to say that appellate courts should not intervene once they have reached a concluded view that the sentencing judge was in error in his or her assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence.  However, the approach in Mulato supra, emphasises the need for caution in reaching such a view and the importance of paying due regard to the opinion of the sentencing judge.
94The Crown maintained the submission that in the circumstances of this case the finding of mid range offending was an error warranting intervention, predominantly, although not exclusively, because his Honour's findings on the issue of provocation and the impact of the respondent's intellectual functioning on his response to the deceased's conduct, and the weight he afforded these factors in mitigation of the objective seriousness of the offending, were not open.  
95Although, as Simpson J observed in Mulato, the principle cautioning against interference with a sentencing judge's assessment of objective seriousness is not because it is determined by reference to the credibility of witnesses, in Koloamatangi [2011] NSWCCA 288 Basten JA at [51] expressed the view that the reluctance to interfere with a sentencing judge's assessment of objective seriousness may be accentuated where the sentencing judge has had a more extensive opportunity to assess the circumstances bearing upon the seriousness of the offence after trial than where sentence follows a plea of guilty.  Such was the case here.  In my view, the Crown's challenge to his Honour's findings on the degree of provocation and the impact of the respondent's mental health and functioning, and the weight he apparently afforded these factors, failed to account for the advantage his Honour had in assessing the witnesses who gave evidence at the trial, including the respondent.  
96In the result, I am unable to conclude that his Honour's findings of fact bearing on the assessment of objective seriousness and his ultimate finding that the offending was in the mid range were not open to him.  In particular, I am unable to conclude that his Honour has overstated the degree of provocation the respondent was confronted with or the extent to which it operated in mitigation of the objective seriousness of the offence.  His findings on that issue were open on the evidence and matters to which he was entitled to afford significant weight in his assessment of objective seriousness.  I am not unmindful of the fact that in shooting the deceased the respondent intended to kill him or of the interplay of aggravating factors relied upon by the Crown, including unlawful possession of the handgun, the ferocity attending its use when twelve shots were fired in quick succession at the deceased in his car and that the shooting occurred in a public place in the presence of members of the deceased's immediate family.  I would venture the view that absent the provocative conduct of the deceased, which in this case was considerable, together with the fact that it was unaccompanied by any pre-planning and unassociated with any gratuitous violence, the objective seriousness of the offence would be above the mid range.
97Because of the way the Crown framed its submissions, that effectively disposes of the first ground of appeal.  Although it was submitted that his Honour's approach to the issue of mental illness disclosed error which infected the sentence ultimately imposed (as contended for in Ground 4), the Crown did not advance the submission that his Honour was not entitled to attribute weight to the respondent's underlying mental condition in assessing objective seriousness, or that in combination with other factors it was not capable of moderating the objective seriousness of what was otherwise described by his Honour as a brutal and violent killing.  
Ground 2: His Honour erred in finding that: (a) ""the offender is a good candidate for rehabilitation and has good prospects of not reoffending"" and(b) ""there are no apparent countervailing factors that suggest that reoffending is likely""
98His Honour made the following finding at [67]:With the exception of a conviction for assault occasioning actual bodily harm in 2007, for which the offender was placed on a s 9 bond, his criminal record is limited to motor vehicle offences and offences committed as a juvenile.  No offences involving the use of weapons, and in particular no offences involving the use of firearms, are recorded.  These are matters that give me confidence that the offender is a good candidate for rehabilitation and has good prospects of not reoffending.  I acknowledge that from a medical point of view the predictions that can be made about the offender in these respects are necessarily speculative and imprecise.  On the other hand, there are no apparent countervailing factors that suggest that reoffending is likely, far less certain, or that the offender will prove to be resistant to positive influences toward rehabilitation.  I am unable to conclude that the offender is likely to be a danger to the public upon his release.  (emphasis added)
99Particular exception was taken to the finding (given emphasis in the extract above) because of what was said to be his Honour's failure to take into consideration on the question of rehabilitation the fact that the respondent had, on his own admission, habitually carried an unregistered, unlicensed, loaded semi-automatic pistol for some years prior to the shooting, conduct which by definition breached various provisions of the Firearms Act 1996.  When reviewing the respondent's subjective circumstances and when considering the use of the gun as an aggravating factor in the assessment of objective seriousness, his Honour made express reference to the fact that the respondent had carried the pistol that killed the deceased for some years prior to the shooting.  However he regarded that behaviour as a feature of the respondent's mental illness as distinct from it demonstrating a predisposition to violence or disregard of the law.  Similarly, what his Honour apparently regarded as important on the question of rehabilitation was not the respondent's past possession of an unlicensed and unregistered pistol but, as confirmed by his criminal record, that he had never used it (or any weapon) to commit any offence.  The fact that his Honour made no reference to the criminal offence of possession of the pistol does not, in my view, of itself undermine in any material way the favourable finding on the issue of rehabilitation.
100The Crown also pointed to the respondent's custodial history where ""Intimidation"" and ""Damage, Destroy Property"" charged as prison regulatory offences after his remand in March 2009 as disentitling him to a finding that his prospects of not reoffending were good.  Accepting that offences of violence committed whilst in prison may reveal an offender's attitude to be inconsistent with rehabilitation (as to which see for example Devaney v R [2012] NSWCCA 285 per Campbell JA at [163]), it does not appear from the Crown's submissions on sentence that his Honour was invited to take into account the offences committed in prison as bearing upon the respondent's attitude to violence or any risk of future dangerousness.  I note that save for Professor Greenberg having noted as one of the static risk factors utilised for the purpose of predicting future violent offending under the heading of ""Prior Supervision Failure"", that ""it is also reported that whilst in custody [the respondent] has been involved in various misdemeanours"", there is no reference in the evidence to the context in which the regulatory offences were committed.  
101Given the range of matters his Honour was required to take into account on the issue of rehabilitation it is, perhaps, unsurprising that he made no reference to the prison offences.  I am not persuaded, however, that his failure to refer to them constituted error or, to the extent that they were of some relevance to the question of rehabilitation, that the offences were of such seriousness over a lengthy remand as to overwhelm the combined weight of those factors which his Honour did take into account in the respondent's favour on the question.  Although, as I have noted, there is nothing in the evidence that provides any context for either offence, the fact that they were committed over the course of a remand of three years, with the first of the two committed almost 18 months after he was taken into custody and the second 12 months later, operates to diminish their significance for sentencing purposes. 
102More critically, the Crown submitted that his Honour's findings as to the respondent's favourable prospects of rehabilitation were not supported by the views of Professor Greenberg and Dr Nielssen and that a more guarded finding was the most favourable available on the evidence.
103In support of that submission, the Crown placed particular reliance upon the supplementary report of Professor Greenberg dated 1 November 2011.  That report was obtained by the Crown after trial for the express purpose of addressing the likelihood of the respondent accepting and complying with treatment for his mental illness, and whether this would impact on the risk of him being violent in the future.  The report would appear to have been sought with a view to it supporting the Crown submission that the imposition of a life sentence was warranted.  Professor Greenberg's conclusions and Dr Nielssen's report of 29 November 2011 which commented upon them were, however, also relevant to the question of rehabilitation and, although his Honour did not refer to either of them in express terms, it is clear from his sentencing remarks that he considered them in this way.  
104For the purposes of his supplementary report, Professor Greenberg reviewed his clinical assessments of the respondent incorporated into his earlier reports for diagnostic purposes and on the issue of substantial impairment, the expert medical reports obtained by the defence directed to the same issue and the respondent's evidence at trial.  He did not however undertake a structured Clinical Risk Assessment of the respondent for sentencing purposes. 
105Professor Greenberg identified the respondent's static risk factors which, as he noted, are considered in the literature to have the strongest predictive accuracy.  They included a prior history of violence dating back to early childhood (including his suspension from school due to aggressive behaviour, stand over tactics and physical assaults, and on one occasion the use of a knife to threaten); his criminal record, including the murder of the deceased; his substance abuse, particularly in relation to the use of cocaine; and a diagnosis of a major psychiatric disorder and limited intellectual functioning.  Professor Greenberg then considered the respondent's dynamic risk factors and management factors noting that, by definition, they fluctuate and change over time and may be amenable to treatment and intervention.  These included what he regarded as the respondent's poor insight into his ongoing psychiatric and psychological problems, in part due to his low intellectual functioning; a history of non-compliance with remediation attempts and a lack of responsiveness to treatment, in part because of what was said to be his refusal to cooperate with mental health services in the community and in the custodial setting.  
106With the caveat that because of the number of factors that come into play in any given case prediction of the future risk of violent offending is imprecise, Professor Greenberg considered that the respondent posed a moderate to high risk of future violent offending.  He reported that there was a potential for that risk to decrease over an extended period of time assuming the respondent was motivated and willing to engage in psychiatric and psychological treatment and to actively participate in a management program. 
107In his report of 29 November 2011 Dr Nielssen acknowledged that he had read Professor Greenberg's report of 1 November 2011.  In the Crown's submissions on the appeal the following passages from the report were relied upon as reflecting Dr Nielssen's views concerning the potential for the respondent to reoffend which the Crown submitted were generally supportive of the proposition that only a guarded finding favourable to the respondent was open:I concur with the general methodology of Professor Greenberg in considering aspects of Mr Fahda's past behaviour, his circumstances and his mental state in attempting to estimate Mr Fahda's potential for further violent offences.  However, predictions based on these factors mainly relate to his current condition and cannot take into account his state of mind or circumstances some time into the future.  
...
...The history of repeated psychological trauma and past abuse is likely to increase Mr Fahda's potential to react in a violent way unless he receives appropriate treatment and rehabilitation.
I concur with Professor Greenberg's observations about the potential effect of a resumption of substance use after release, which would .be likely to have the effect of triggering an exacerbation of persecutory beliefs and anxiety symptoms, and lead to his association with criminals and to his participation in illegal activity... by the time of his release, Mr Fahda is likely to have been largely abstinent from drugs for some years...
There is conflicting evidence about the effect of psychotic illness on the probability of violence, in part because of the failure of many studies to distinguish between minor and serious forms of violence.  Some studies show mental illness to be a protective factor, because most violence takes place before initial effective treatment, psychosis is amenable to treatment and because the emergence of negative symptoms of chronic psychotic illness over time is associated with a reduced propensity to violence.  Mr Fahda requires adequate treatment for his underlying psychotic illness, and adequate treatment will reduce the probability of further violence.
...
I concur with the conclusion of Professor Greenberg that Mr Fahda would be likely to derive considerable benefit from psychiatric treatment, which in my opinion should include detention in a location in which he feels safe, where there is ready access to mental health care and with the minimum number of transfers.  I would recommend further psychiatric assessment and treatment with appropriate psychotropic medication to control symptoms of psychosis and ameliorate anxiety symptoms, together with individual counselling.  He may derive some benefit from participation in therapeutic programs offered by the Department of Corrective Services, for example, the violent offenders program.  It would also be hoped that in due course Mr Fahda would become eligible for transfer to lower security prisons where he could participate in work and educational programs, and not be detained in maximum security until close to the time he is eligible for release, as has happened to some other prisoners in similar circumstances.
108Significantly, as I see it, the Crown did not extract Dr Nielssen's views as to whether the respondent would likely be responsive to treatment directed to reducing the risk of further violence, or the matters Professor Greenberg relied upon as contributing to a risk of future violence.  As to those matters Dr Nielssen said this:Mr Fahda's attitudes towards authority figures and justice officials have also been shaped by his experiences.  The history is that he has very limited experience of counselling or psychiatric care, and has had little attention from mental health services in custody.  Hence it is not possible to say whether he is in fact unresponsive to treatment.
The dynamic, or current risk factors are not especially relevant as they relate to Mr Fahda's current circumstances, and are unlikely to reflect his circumstances as he approaches release.
...
In summary, Mr Fahda has a combination of severe early life trauma and major mental illness that were major contributing factors to his offence and for which he will require intensive rehabilitation and ongoing support and treatment after his eventual release.  I agree with Professor Greenberg that ""prediction of the future is an imprecise prediction"" because of the specific circumstances of Mr Fahda's offence and our inability to predict the course of his illness, how he will respond to treatment, or the circumstances he will face when he becomes eligible for release.
109Even affording full weight to the moderating views of Dr Nielssen, the Crown's submission that the opinions expressed by the experts rendered a positive finding that the respondent had good prospects of rehabilitation unavailable does have some force.  That said, and while it is clear that in expressing a measure of confidence in the respondent's prospects of rehabilitation his Honour did not refer to the factors identified by Professor Greenberg as contributing to a risk of reoffending, or that in his view the risk was moderate to high, his Honour did acknowledge what both experts were concerned to emphasise, namely that the risk of future offending is speculative and imprecise.  He went on to say:...On the other hand, there are no apparent countervailing factors that suggest that reoffending is likely, far less certain, or that the offender will prove to be resistant to positive influences towards rehabilitation.  I am unable to conclude that the offender is likely to be a danger to the public upon his release.
110Where a lengthy sentence of mandatory custody is to be imposed (as was the case here) it has long been recognised by the courts that any assessment concerning the risk of future dangerousness, although relevant, is necessarily speculative (see Bugmy v R [1990] HCA 18; 169 CLR 525).  That said, as Gleeson CJ observed in Fardon v Attorney-General (Qld) [2004] HCA 46; 223 CLR 575, despite the potential unreliability inherent in a prediction of future dangerousness, such predictions may also be accurate and, as Johnson J recognised in Beldon v R [2012] NSWCCA 194at [56], it remains part of the responsibility of a sentencing judge to have regard to it despite the significant element of imprecision inherent in the exercise.  In some cases the circumstances in which the offence was committed suggest the possibility of a high likelihood of future dangerousness and future violent offending (see Ng v R [2011] NSWCCA 227; 214 A Crim R 191 at [59]-[73]).  This case was not however in that category and I do not understand the Crown to have so submitted.
111Although his Honour made no reference to the length of the non-parole period in the context of the respondent's relative youth as bearing upon his conclusion that a forecast of future dangerousness could not be made, those two factors in combination well supported what is implicit in his Honour's finding, namely that any prediction as to the future behaviour of the respondent was speculative and that a finding that there was a risk of reoffending could not be safely made.  Significantly, the respondent was 24 at the date of sentence and will be 38 before his eligibility for release to parole falls to be considered.  As I see it, in a practical sense the risk of his reoffending and an assessment of his dangerousness is a matter for assessment at that time by the New South Wales Probation and Parole Service in discharge of its statutory functions.
112Of course his Honour was not limited to the evidence of the forensic psychiatrists when considering whether or not the respondent was a good candidate for rehabilitation, or whether or not there were countervailing factors suggesting that he was likely to reoffend.  
113In that regard, his Honour made express reference to the relative youth of the respondent at the time of the offence as bearing significantly on the question of rehabilitation.  He said as follows:...[His relative youth] does not represent a factor that operates of itself to ameliorate the extent of the offender's criminality but is relevant to the question of his prospects for rehabilitation and, by necessary inference, to the likelihood of reoffending. It should also be considered in the context of his insignificant criminal record.
114As his counsel emphasised on appeal, as a relatively young offender (aged 24 at the time of sentence) his Honour was entitled to regard the respondent's record as relatively minor and, in one sense, the more so in circumstances where, by contrast, his family history was marked with extreme violence to which he had been exposed.
115I am satisfied his Honour's assessment of the respondent's prospects of rehabilitation over the course of his sentence, while optimistic, was a view open to him.  He was entitled to take into account all the evidence, including the respondent's evidence, his criminal antecedents in the context of his relative youth, and the references from close family members tendered on sentence which attested to his developing insights and the ongoing love and support of his mother and sisters.
Ground 3: His Honour erred in finding that the respondent was ""severely intellectually disadvantaged""
116Reference has already been made to the various ways in which his Honour considered that the respondent's level of intellectual functioning operated in mitigation of sentence, and the Crown's concession on the appeal that despite pressing for a finding of error in his Honour's description of the respondent as ""severely intellectually disadvantaged"", the medical evidence nevertheless generally supported a finding that the respondent was of ""limited"" or ""low"" intelligence.  
117In his report of 7 March 2011, Mr Borenstein, a clinical psychologist whose report was tendered on behalf of the defence without objection, reported upon the results of psychometric testing of the respondent as follows:On the short version of the WAIS-III, Mr Fahda's verbal and performance intelligence was tested as falling in the 2nd percentile range, and extremely low.  Overall intelligence tested in the 1st percentile range.
Verbal comprehension was marginally improved and tested in the 3rd percentile range, considered to be extremely low, as was perceptual organisation (2nd percentile range), and working memory index (1st percentile range).
...
Mr Fahda is a man of extremely low intelligence.  Mr Fahda's reading age is no better than 10 years 8 months.  His intelligence is no better than the 2nd percentile, compared to aged peers, ie 98% of Mr Fahda's aged peers perform at a higher intellectual level than he, which places him at significant disadvantage intellectually.  Mr Fahda has a very low emotional intelligence.  He lacks insight with regards the nature of his illness, and has never effectively learned to manage same.
Mr Fahda's mental capacity is extremely limited, confirmed by way of psychometric analysis...
118Although the Crown did not refer, in terms, to these results in her written submissions, she did note that Professor Greenberg stated in his report of 23 August 2011 that:Mr Fahda was tested for intelligence using the WISC scale in 1996 [that is, when he was 9 years old] and found to be of low average intelligence. 
...
Intellectually Mr Fahda has previously been formally tested by the Department of Education and found to be functioning in the low average or borderline intellectual range.  I note that Mr Borenstein also tested his intellectual functioning and reported that he functioned in the ""extremely low range"".  In my opinion Mr Fahda does not have an intellectual disability (mental retardation).
119I am satisfied that the medical evidence provided ample support for a finding that the respondent was intellectually compromised, and to some considerable degree.  I do not understand his Honour's description of the respondent as ""severely intellectually disadvantaged"" as interchangeable with, or intended to signify that he has an intellectual disability that equates with, or is even likened to, mental retardation.
120I would reject this ground of appeal.
Ground 4: His Honour erred in his approach to the respondent's mental illness
121On the appeal the Crown accepted that a finding that the respondent was mentally ill at the time of the commission of the offence (a condition which his Honour noted was well documented and of long-standing) and that his condition materially contributed to the commission of the offence was open on the evidence.  The Crown submitted, however, that his Honour's approach to sentencing in these circumstances was contrary to the principled approach mandated by the authorities.
122The first error is said to result from the fact that in referring to R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33]-[35] per Sperling J, his Honour made reference to only three of the four principles which are identified as having a material bearing on sentencing a mentally ill offender.
123The Crown accepted that his Honour correctly recognised that where there is a material connection between the commission of the offence and the mental illness (as was the case here), the moral culpability of the offender may be reduced and, for that reason, there may not be the same call for denunciation in the sentence that is imposed.  The Crown also accepted that his Honour gave appropriate recognition to the fact that mental illness may render an offender an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence and that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on a person who is mentally ill.  However, the Crown submitted that his Honour was in error by not including any reference to the fourth, countervailing consideration, namely the level of danger the community may be exposed to where a violent crime has been committed by a mentally ill offender which may sound the need for the sentence to reflect special deterrence. 
124Were the Crown to have established that there was a real likelihood of the respondent reoffending upon his eventual release, thereby exposing the community to an unacceptable level of danger (R v Robinson [2002] NSWCCA 359 at [49]), and to the criminal standard (see Devaney per Allsop P at [168], Price J agreeing), as distinct from there being ""some likelihood"" of that occurring as submitted by the Crown on appeal, the fact that his Honour did not refer to it as necessitating some counterweight to the mitigating effect of the respondent's mental illness so as to reflect special deterrence may well have constituted error (see R v Windle [2012] NSWCCA 222 at [41]-[57] where Basten JA, with whom Price J agreed, reconsidered the weight that may properly be given to the protection of the community where an offender's mental illness causes an element of future dangerousness).  However where, as here, the evidence was to the effect that any predictions of the respondent's future dangerousness were ""speculative"" and ""imprecise"" (as Professor Greenberg acknowledged in his report to which reference has already been made), and where his Honour was unable to otherwise conclude that the respondent was likely to be a danger to the community upon his release, he was not obliged to refer to the need for special deterrence and was not in error in failing to do so.
125The second error was said to be the way his Honour treated the causal link between the respondent's mental illness and the fatal shooting. The Crown submitted that it appears from the sentencing remarks that, without further deliberation, his Honour concluded that because the causal link was forged neither general deterrence nor special deterrence carried any weight in the sentencing exercise and, in so doing, he acted contrary to established principle.   
126Were his Honour to have approached the issue in that way he would have been in error.  In R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 68 Gleeson CJ emphasised the need when sentencing a mentally ill offender for the facts of an individual case to attract a careful and considered discretionary judgment in light of the sometimes intricate interplay of the purposes of criminal punishment served by the sentencing exercise.  
127On a balanced reading of his Honour's remarks I am unable to identify the error of principle the Crown contends for.  In my view, the following passage puts that beyond doubt:[68] I am particularly mindful that the offender's psychiatric, psychological and intellectual disabilities are central to a proper assessment of the appropriate sentence to be imposed.  I have no doubt that the offender's mental illness contributed to the commission of the offence in a material way, so that his moral culpability is correspondingly reduced.  I consider that in this case the call for denunciation must be tempered and the punishment warranted should accordingly be reduced.  I have in mind in this regard the findings of the medical experts who have examined the offender, which suggest that he suffered from a paranoid psychosis with symptoms including hyper-vigilance and auditory hallucinations superimposed upon a limited intelligence. It is highly likely that the offender's responses to the actual threats that were made to him by the deceased, and the threats that he perceived were being made, such as that the deceased was blocking his exit from the car park, resulted in responses from him that might have been different in a mentally healthy and more intelligent person.  I find that what the deceased said to the offender had an impact on his self-control and that there was a considerable loss of self-control when this crime was committed.  In making this finding I have had regard to the medical evidence, which I accept as to the offender's psychiatric disorders.  Those disorders accounted in part for the impact on the offender's self-control. 
128He went on to say:The crime in this case was particularly enigmatic and idiosyncratic.  It cannot be viewed as one into the commission of which members of the public are likely regularly, or habitually, to descend. It is unrelated to a  course of common criminal behaviour from which it unfolded all emerged.  It was, on the contrary, spontaneous and impulsive.   
129With respect to the issues of general and specific deterrence his Honour said: An offender with intellectual or mental health disabilities is not an appropriate medium for general deterrence: see R v George. Similarly questions of personal deterrence may have less significance because the interests of society do not require that persons with a relevant disability should be punished as severely as persons without a disability"" R v Anderson (1980) 2 A Crim R 397 at 384-5).
130In my view, his Honour's findings were not only well supported by the evidence but his analysis accorded with the ""sensitive discretionary decision"" Gleeson CJ emphasised in Engert is called for when a mentally ill offender comes into collision with the criminal justice system.
131The importance of this approach and the difficult questions of judgment involved in the imposition of a sentence on a mentally ill offender for a violent crime was revisited in Devaney where, after referring to the purposes of punishment in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and the remarks of Gleeson CJ in Engert, Allsop P said:[75] These considerations arise by reason of the need to resolve the just and proportionate response to the commission of a grave crime by someone suffering significant a psychiatric illness that is relevant, indeed central to the commission of the crime.  Logic may dictate that such circumstances necessarily lead to significant leniency in sentence.  That is not so...
132He went on to say at [79]:The judgment of the majority (Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ) in Veen (No 2), especially at 472-477, though dealing with manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility, is of particular guiding assistance.  The place of the protection of the public in the assessment of the just and proportionate sentence, as distinct from preventative detention derived from the need for such protection, and the difficulty in distinguishing the two is illuminatingly discussed.  As the majority in Veen (No 2) said (at 476), sentencing is not an exercise in logic.  A heavy sentence for someone whose moral responsibility for a crime has been lessened by mental impairment may be illogical.  But the just proportionality of a sentence must be such as supports, and not undermines, public confidence in the processes of criminal justice and the law: cf Veen (No 2) at 477.  Powerful considerations in any case in that regard are the institutional response to and punishment of life threatening violence inflicted in a terrifying attack, and the protection of the public.  The difficulties involved were discussed by Basten JA in R v Windle [2012] NSWCCA 222 at [41]-[50].
133In addition to his Honour's failure to refer to Engert (which the Crown submitted was the likely source of error in the way he treated the issue of general and special deterrence, about which I remain unpersuaded) the Crown submitted that R v George [2004] NSWCCA 247; 149 A Crim R 38 was not an unqualified authority for the proposition that a mentally ill offender is not an appropriate medium for general deterrence and that his Honour's reliance on George for that proposition was in error.  In George at [36] the Court (Wood CJ at CL, Adams and Kirby JJ) said the reason that less weight is given to general deterrence in the case of an offender suffering from a mental disorder or abnormality:lies in the circumstance that the community will readily understand that the offender who suffers from a mental disorder or abnormality is less in control of his or her cognitive facilities or emotional restraints, and in some instances lacks the ability to make reasoned or ordered judgments. Almost invariably there is a limited appreciation of the wrongfulness of the act, or of its moral culpability, which although falling short of avoiding criminal responsibility does justify special consideration upon sentencing. Moreover, such a condition is inherent and its presence does not depend upon any element of choice.
134The Court went on to say:[37] Where such a condition is present, it is recognised that the offender is not an appropriate medium by which to make an example to others.
[38] Similar considerations apply in relation to personal deterrence where the disability is such that the offender may not fully appreciate or understand the nature of his or her offending, or of the message which the sentence is expected to convey.
135In short, the Crown's submission appeared to be that his Honour did not undertake an analysis of the respondent's appreciation of the wrongfulness of his act or of his moral culpability as mandated by the collected authorities referred to in George before concluding that he was ""not a proper vehicle for pronouncements about general deterrence"".  I am not persuaded that his Honour's approach was contrary to principle or that there was any error in his reasoning or concluded views.
136The third error in approach contended for by the Crown concerned his Honour's approach to a finding on the question of future dangerousness and the risk of offending on release.  As discussed previously, I am of the opinion that his Honour's findings on that question were open on the evidence and no error in principle or in his approach to the issue has been demonstrated.
Ground 5:  His Honour erred by failing to impose a sentence that reflected the objective gravity of the offence and the aggravating factors and was manifestly inadequate
137Having failed to make good the challenge to his Honour's assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence as contended for in Ground 1, and having failed to establish any of the errors contended for in Grounds 2, 3 and 4, for this Court to regard the sentence as manifestly inadequate it must be demonstrably clear that it was so inadequate as to be unreasonable or manifestly unjust by reason of latent error. 
138As I understand the Crown's primary submission in support of this ground of appeal, a comparison of what are suggested as comparable sentencing decisions compels the conclusion that a sentence of imprisonment of 20 years with a non-parole period of 14 years resonated with latent error.
139The Crown also submitted that his Honour failed to give sufficient weight to features of the offending bearing upon its objective seriousness and overweighted the respondent's subjective case which, in combination, contributed to the inadequacy of the sentence.  Although, as Button J observed in Hanania v R [2012] NSWCCA 220, the weight given to particular circumstances in a sentencing exercise should be considered as a particular of manifest excess (or inadequacy), that is, in considering the sentencing outcome not its process, for the reasons advanced in rejecting the Crown's other grounds of appeal, I do not consider that the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate by this approach. 
140The cases to which the Court was referred are those to which this Court was referred in Beldon.  In that case counsel supplied a schedule of murder sentences (mostly at first instance) in seeking to overturn a sentence of 24 years with a non-parole period of 16 years as manifestly excessive.  Reference to the content of the schedule is found at [98] and [103]-[104] of the judgment of Johnson J as follows:[98]  I have had regard to the cases referred to by the Applicant as suggested comparable cases. Those decisions are R v O'Leary [2004] NSWSC 821; R v Heffernan [2005] NSWSC 739; Apps v R [2006] NSWCCA 290; R v Waters [2006] NSWSC 502; R v Harvey [2007] NSWSC 871; R v Thompson [2008] NSWSC 109; R v Pocock [2008] NSWSC 1435; R v Shamouil [2009] NSWSC 24; R v O'Donnell [2009] NSWSC 42; R v Edwards [2009] NSWSC 164; R v Carr [2009] NSWSC 995; R v Cox [2009] NSWSC 1067; R v Holcroft [2010] NSWSC 1294; R v Borg [2010] NSWSC 951; R v Jones [2010] NSWSC 432; R v Wong [2010] NSWSC 171 and Lee v R [2011] NSWCCA 169. In addition, I have had regard to Tran v R. 
...
[103]  It is the case that the full term of imprisonment of 24 years imposed upon the Applicant is greater than the full term imposed upon any of the offenders in these cases. A head sentence of imprisonment for 24 years was imposed by this Court on a successful appeal by the offender in Tran v R.
[104]  The non-parole period imposed, in a number of these cases, was close to or at the level of the non-parole period specified for the present Applicant: R v Wong (15 years and six months); R v Jones (16 years); R v Borg (16 years); R v Holcroft (17 years); R v Edwards (14 years); R v O'Donnell (16 years and six months); R v Shamouil (14 years and six months); R v Pocock (14 years and nine months); R v Thompson (15 years); R v Waters (15 years) and R v O'Leary (16 years). 
141As Johnson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Hammerschlag J agreed) said in Beldon and as applies with equal emphasis on a Crown appeal on the grounds of manifest inadequacy: [101]  Appellate intervention on the ground that a sentence is manifestly excessive is not justified simply because (if it be the case) the result arrived at below is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases. Rather, intervention is warranted only where the difference is such that, in all the circumstances, the appellate court concludes that there must have been some misapplication of principle, even though where and how is not apparent from the reasons: Wong v R [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at 605 [58]; Hili v R at 538-539 [58]-[59]. That this Court may have exercised the sentencing discretion differently is not the test: Lowndes v R [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665 at 671-672 [15].
142In referring to the schedule of cases and, in particular, the non-parole period's imposed, the Crown pointed to the fact that in each of R v Jones [2010] NSWSC 432, R v Borg [2010] NSWSC 951, R v Holcroft [2010] NSWSC 1294, R v Shamouil [2009] NSWSC 24, R v Pocock [2008] NSWSC 1435, R v Harvey [2007] NSWSC 871, R v Edwards [2009] NSWSC 164 and R v Heffernan [2005] NSWSC 739, the offending was found to be below mid range, in some cases well below.  Only in Edwards, Shamouil and Pocock (where the sentencing judge assessed the objective criminality to be respectively ""a little below mid range"" and ""close to but below mid range"") was a non-parole period imposed comparable to that imposed on the respondent.  However, as the Crown pointed out, in each of those three cases the offender had pleaded guilty.  In Holcroft and Borg, both cases where the offender was sentenced after trial, and in each case where the offender's mental illness was a relevant consideration, non-parole periods of 16 and 17 years were imposed.  The Crown submitted that even after affording appropriate weight to the causational impact of the respondent's mental illness, and despite the fact that the intention to kill was formed under some degree of provocation, a sentence providing for a non-parole period significantly above 14 years was called for in this case. 
143Given the very different factual circumstances in each of the cases included on the schedule, and the limits on the use of unrelated cases for comparative purposes the High Court was concerned to emphasise in Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [53]-[54], other than designating the sentence imposed on the respondent at towards the bottom of a notional range for murder I am not persuaded that the cases to which the Crown referred compel the conclusion that the sentence imposed exceeded his Honour's sentencing discretion.  As the Court observed in Hili and as Johnson J noted in Beldon at [84], while consistency in sentencing is a laudable objective, what is sought to be achieved is consistency in the application of relevant sentencing principles not some numerical or mathematical equivalence between different cases.
144In Hili the High Court also endorsed the views of Simpson J in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1; 205 A Crim R 1 at [303]-[305] as to the use to which information about other cases might legitimately be put.  Her Honour said:[303]  A history of sentencing can establish a range of sentences that have in fact been imposed.  Such a history does not establish that that range is the correct range, nor that either the upper or the lower limit is the correct upper and lower limit.  Sentencing patterns are, of course, of considerable significance in that they result from the application of the accumulated experience and wisdom of first instance judges and of appellate courts.
145The respondent's counsel drew the Court's attention to graphs prepared by the Judicial Commission relating to sentences imposed on all offenders convicted of murder between January 2005 and December 2011 noting that the head sentence imposed on the respondent was only two years less than the median head sentence of 22 years and the non-parole period two years less than the median non-parole period of 16 years.  No further analysis of the statistics was provided and in particular no identification of sentences imposed after the introduction of a standard non-parole period in 2002.  For my part, and with the usual caveat as to the utility of sentencing statistics where a sentence is under review, I do not find the statistics particularly instructive other than to confirm what the schedule of cases relied upon by the Crown indicated, namely that the sentence was towards the bottom of the same notional range. 
146It hardly bears repeating that appellate intervention on the ground that the sentence is manifestly inadequate is not justified simply because the sentence imposed is different from the sentences that have been imposed in other cases, still less that this Court may have exercised the sentencing discretion differently and imposed a heavier sentence.   
147In the result, I am not persuaded that the sentence imposed was unreasonable or plainly unjust.  
148The orders I propose are:1.  Leave to appeal granted.2.  Appeal dismissed.
149DAVIES J:  I agree with Fullerton J.

2706866,R v Cohen JIRGENS [2013] NSWDC 87,"Judgment

Indictment and Procedural History

1On 22 April 2013, the accused, Cohen Jirgens, was arraigned on an indictment containing the following counts:
1. On 12 September 2009 at Sutherland in the State of New South Wales did drive a motor vehicle, namely, a utility registered number AOE-12K and attached trailer registration number P678790, in a manner dangerous to other persons, whereby the vehicle was involved in an impact as a result of which the death of Mark Cooper was occasioned. 

2. On 12 September 2009 at Sutherland in the State of New South Wales did drive a motor vehicle, namely, a utility registered number AOE-12K and attached trailer registration number P678790, in a manner dangerous to other persons, whereby the vehicle was involved in an impact as a result of which grievous bodily harm was occasioned to Sian McIntosh.

2This matter proceeds by way of an ex officio indictment following discharge of the accused in the Local Court on 31 August 2011.

Application

3The accused has sought that the trial be conducted on a judge alone basis, pursuant to section 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, by way of a notice of motion filed 19 October 2012. The basis for the application is that:
(a) the evidence is of a technical nature and may be misunderstood by a jury; 
(b) a judge alone trial would be quicker and more flexible than a jury trial; and
(c) in the event of a conviction, a jury verdict would be opaque as far as the basis for the assessment of the cause of the accident and collision and the accused's culpability. For example, whether his driving was dangerous and his conduct was culpable by virtue of the way he loaded and drove the vehicle, together with issues of load weight, load distribution, tyre pressure, the condition of the brakes etc.

4The Crown opposes the application for a judge alone trial and submits that the factual issues to be determined require the application of objective community standards as to:
(a) the dangerousness involved in the driving in this instance; and 
(b) the determination of the accused's belief at the relevant time and, in particular, whether his belief was:
(i) an honest belief; and
(ii) a reasonable belief 
in all the circumstances. 

Facts

5A brief summary of the facts is that the accused was driving South in his utility with an attached trailer on the Princes Highway, between President Avenue, Sutherland and the Royal National Park turnoff, on 12 September 2009 at about midday. The trailer was heavily laden with timber. The photographs tendered (exhibits 9 and 10) show the way the timber was loaded on the trailer. At the extremities the timber was about seven metres in length and extended over the length of the trailer. There was a red or orange flag attached to the longest end of the timber. The timber was secured on the rim of the trailer on horizontal timber struts or dunnage. 

6The accused was driving a long distance, namely, from his home in Bomaderry, near Nowra in the Shoalhaven, to Sydney, a distance of about 130 kilometres. He was to collect and load the timber in his father's trailer and then make the return trip. The return trip with the loaded timber would have involved travelling on the Princes Highway through suburban Sydney and then the towns on the route between Sydney and Bombaderry. Clearly that trip would have involved travelling on a busy highway through changes of gradient and curved road sections as well as a variety of traffic conditions. 

7A witness, Mr Coroneos, observed the accused's motor vehicle and, in particular, the trailer, start to wobble as it was being driven, immediately prior to the collision. The wobble either commenced or was accentuated as it came down in the southbound lanes of the Princes Highway and around a curve sloping away from the median strip. The motion of the vehicle became a side-to-side swing, the arc of the swing of the trailer increasing. The utility with the attached trailer hit and mounted the wide median strip and crossed into the northbound side of the highway. The swing of the vehicle and trailer meant that the vehicle and trailer became horizontal to the opposite laneway on the Princes Highway. The car then collided with the deceased's small sedan car which was travelling in the opposite northbound direction. The photographs of the car driven by the deceased showed that the ceiling to the driver's seat was effectively demolished.

8The driver of the car, Mr Mark Cooper, was killed in the collision (count 1) and his partner, Ms Sian McIntosh, was seriously injured (count 2). There is no issue as to those matters. Their four year old child was seated in the rear of the vehicle. He was secured in a car seat and was relatively unscathed (physically) by the accident.

9The statement of another witness, Mr Brett Rolley, described the impact of the utility as, ""seeming to jack-knife right into the front of"" Mr Cooper's vehicle. Evidence will be given as to the extent of skid marks on the road immediately prior to the collision. 

10In terms of other matters that might be relevant to the cause of the accident, the weather and the road were dry at the time. The road was properly constructed. 

Crown case

11The Crown evidence will focus on the manner of driving, what was being driven and the steps taken by the accused. It will be to the effect that:
(i) the combination of the vehicle and trailer in the circumstances, with the weight load, meant that the accused was driving the utility with the attached trailer when they were overweight (in combination) by 1450 kilograms;
(ii) the distribution of the weight of the trailer contributed to the instability of the trailer prior to the impact;
(iii) there was an uneven distribution of air in the tyres of the trailer;
(iv) there were defective brakes on the trailer. The Crown case will be that, had the trailer brakes been in working order, it may have had the effect of correcting the sway; further, defective trailer brakes meant that speed could not be reduced as much as it would have been had the brakes been in working order;
(v) while there was no suggestion of excessive speed in terms of the breach of any speed limits, the Crown case is that it was dangerous to be driving at the speed being driven by the accused in these circumstances; 
(vi) it was unreasonable for the accused to have driven with the overloaded trailer in all the circumstances, given the distances he proposed. 

Expert witnesses

12I have been provided with relevant expert reports on the matter, together with a certificate setting out that the accused has obtained legal advice as to the effect of this application. 

13There will be three expert witnesses:

(i) Mr Eliopoulos, a police vehicle examiner and mechanic, who examined the trailer and utility at the police holding yard three days after the collision. He took various photographs of the trailer, its load of timber and tyres, as well as notes of the tyre pressure of each tyre. Mr Eliopoulos' statement was tendered on the voire dire. Paragraph 20 sets out his opinion that the brakes to the trailer were not working at the time of the collision; further, that they had not worked for a period of at least two weeks prior to the collision. He also says at paragraph 22 that the trailer was overweight by 200 kilograms and the vehicle was over its towing capacity by 400 kilograms. At paragraph 24 he sets out his opinion that the vehicle may have become unstable due to the weight of the trailer and the way the timber was distributed on the trailer. The lack of braking may have adversely affected the driver's ability to slow the vehicle and trailer down.

(ii) Mr Grant Johnston, mechanical engineer. His evidence will be particularly as to asymmetric loading, vehicle sway and the impact on the movement of the utility, the trailer and its load. Mr Johnston's report dated 27 May 2012 (voir dire exhibit 1) gives the opinion that:
(a) The asymmetrical loading of the trailer and in particular its significant magnitude was a precipitator of the loss of control event; and
(b) The mechanical defect in the braking system also contributed to the loss of control as the natural safety mechanism which should have been working to reduce the potential for trailer sway and loss of control was not present. Further, that the mechanical defect in the braking system reduced the stopping capacity of the combination vehicle such that once loss of control occurred, any braking which occurred was less efficient and 'washed off' less speed compared to the circumstances if the brakes were operating correctly.

(iii) Mr Alan Joy, the defence engineering expert, has provided a statement in reply to those matters. Mr Joy's statement also sets out that the tow bar fitted to the accused's utility was designed and rated to tow a trailer with 1200 kilograms laden mass, a towing capacity of 750 kilograms for a trailer not equipped with brakes and 1800 kilograms for a trailer equipped with brakes. Mr Joy's opinion was that the exceeding of the towbar's rated load capacity was not the cause of the accident.

14There are a series of civilian witnesses who saw the accused's vehicle and trailer. There are preliminary objections taken as to the expressions of opinion: 
(i) Ms Sian McIntosh (the victim in the second count) who said that the accused was coming ""way to fast"" down the hill; 
(ii) Mr Coroneos (a passer-by) whose opinion was that there was ""too much wood on the trailer""; and
(iii) Mr Kurtz (an observer of the accused's vehicle) as to the way the trailer was loaded at the traffic lights immediately prior to the accident and what drew his attention to the trailer, namely, that there had been ""dangerous loading"" of the trailer. It is submitted by counsel for the accused that his recollection was one of reconstruction, rather than accurate or contemporaneous observation.

15I will hear counsel on these objections but express the preliminary view that the matters advanced should be based on observations of factual matters, distances, loads, lengths and ties of the timber, movements of the vehicles etc.

Law

16Section 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 relevantly provides:
""... (4) If the prosecutor does not agree to the accused person being tried by a Judge alone, the court may make a trial by judge order if it considers it is in the interests of justice to do so.

(5) Without limiting subsection (4), the court may refuse to make an order if it considers that the trial will involve a factual issue that requires the application of objective community standards, including (but not limited to) an issue of reasonableness, negligence, indecency, obscenity or dangerousness.""

17The determination of these matters is not conducted on a strictly adversarial basis. The issue of judge alone trials has recently been the subject of interpretation by the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Belghar [2012] NSWCCA 86.

Consideration

18Here, the trial will involve the determination and application of community standards as to:
(a) what constitutes dangerous driving, specifically, driving a trailer said to be dangerously loaded;
(b) what steps are reasonable in terms of the driving, the loading of trailers and the securing of loads in trailers; and 
(c) whether driving with this loaded trailer in all the circumstances and particularly with allegedly defective brakes was dangerous. 
Those matters will require an assessment of the competing expert evidence and the assessment of those matters and principles as to the facts as found. Clearly the honesty of the accused's belief that what he did was appropriate and reasonable is likely to be to a significant issue. 

19The Crown is entitled to rely on all the factors relevant to the driving as to whether or not it was dangerous. Balanced against that is the related assessment of whether the steps taken by the accused to secure the load were reasonable. In that regard the Defence relies on the fact that the timber load remained tied and secured to the trailer, notwithstanding the force of the collision, to support the contention that the steps taken were appropriate. 

Prejudice

20It is implicit in the defence application that facts of the matter, in particular, the death - and the circumstances - of the deceased driver and the photographs to be tendered of the crushed vehicle, will have a prejudicial effect on a jury. That is the nature of the evidence. Both the jury panel and the jury will be reminded of the need to be objective and considered in their assessment of the evidence and not to be swayed by emotive reactions or considerations of sympathy. 

21In terms of other prejudicial matters, the parties have agreed on facts relating to the death and indicia of grievous bodily harm, which will obviate the need for photographs of the deceased or Ms McIntosh, medical reports and any consequential prejudice.

Complexity and length of trial

22There are no complex propositions of law which would not be capable of being explained by proper and appropriate directions. I do not accept on the basis of the material submitted thus far that the trial will involve ""complex engineering, scientific or medical issues"", see Belghar at [112]. There will not be complex evidence such as is likely to be overlooked, forgotten by or not capable of being followed by a jury. If that is a danger, the transcript of the evidence given can be given to the jury.

23This will be a relatively short trial. Even if the trial is to be conducted before a jury, the estimates are in the order of ten days. The accused is not legally aided. There are significant penalties and maximum periods of imprisonment established by Parliament for these offences. 

Assessment of standards

24The legislation specifically contemplates issues of ""reasonableness"" and ""dangerousness"" as being concepts on which the application of objective community standards through a jury trial may enliven a judge's discretion on such an application. There are clear and far-reaching policy issues why this should be the case.

25There is a legitimate and significant public interest in these proceedings and the determination of them by a jury, as the community's representatives. Any trial involving a death of or injury to an innocent party - as both Mr Cooper and Ms McIntosh clearly were - will attract community attention and scrutiny. There have already been committal proceedings, following which the accused was discharged. This trial now proceeds by way of an ex officio indictment. A decision by a judge alone carries a risk of perceptions of decisions being made without a wider input on the assessment and application of community standards. 

26The fact that the jury's reasons may be opaque for sentencing purposes does not render the matter any different from any count where there are descriptive or qualitative words such as ""dangerous"", ""grievous"", ""culpable"" or ""negligent"". If relevant, the determination of the accused's culpability will be determined by the sentencing judge in accordance with normal principles and the evidence presented on any such sentencing proceedings.

Conclusion 

27I am not persuaded on the material before me and the submissions made that it is in the interests of justice for a departure from the normal method of a jury trial. To the contrary, I consider that, in this case, the interests of justice are best served by having the issues of reasonableness and dangerousness determined by a jury.

Order

(1)I dismiss the application for a judge alone trial.
(2)The trial will proceed forthwith before a jury. 

Note
After a ten day trial, the accused was acquitted by a jury on both counts.

		12 June 2013",2013-04-23 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2706868,Natasha Youkhana v R [2013] NSWCCA 85,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ AT CL: I agree with Bellew J and the orders which he proposes.

2SLATTERY J: I agree with Bellew J.

3BELLEW J: In 2006 and 2007 investigations undertaken by a joint taskforce known as ""Operation Schoale"" resulted in the arrest of a number of persons associated with the importation and subsequent sale of large quantities of cocaine. One of the senior figures in those activities was Alen Moradian (""Moradian"") the husband of the applicant. 

4As a consequence of that investigation, the applicant was charged with, and pleaded guilty to, the following offences:

(i)dealing with the proceeds of crime (being an amount $4,642,135.00), contrary to s. 193B(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (""the first count"");

(ii)doing an act with intent to pervert the course of justice, contrary to s. 319 of the Crimes Act 1900 (""the second count"");

(iii)giving evidence before the New South Wales Crime Commission which was, to her knowledge, false in a material particular, contrary to s. 20(1) of the New South Wales Crime Commission Act 1985 (""the third count""); and

(iv)conducting transactions so as to avoid reporting requirements, contrary to s. 31(1) of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 (""the fourth count"").

5On 20 December 2011, his Honour Judge Haesler SC sentenced the applicant as follows: 

(i)as to the first count, a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months commencing on 13 September 2012 and expiring on 12 December 2014, with a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months imprisonment expiring on 12 June 2016; 

(ii)as to the second count, a fixed term of 9 months imprisonment commencing on 13 June 2012 and expiring on 12 March 2013;

(iii)as to the third count, a fixed term of 9 months imprisonment commencing on 13 March 2012 expiring on 12 December 2012; and

(iv)as to the fourth count, a fixed term of 9 months imprisonment commencing on 13 December 2011 and expiring on 12 September 2012.

6The applicant's overall sentence comprised a non-parole period of 3 years imprisonment commencing on 13 December 2011 and expiring on 12 December 2014, with a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months imprisonment expiring on 12 June 2016.

7The applicant now seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed on the grounds more fully set out below.
 
THE FACTS
8A document headed ""Agreed Facts"" was tendered before the sentencing judge. There was, however, one disputed factual matter which is relevant to the first two grounds of appeal. Leaving aside that issue (with which I have dealt separately below) the agreed facts may be summarised as follows.

The first count - dealing with the proceeds of crime: (Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) s. 193B(2))
9The first count related to the applicant's dealing, in various ways, with cash totalling $4,642,135.00 in Australian currency between October 2005 and July 2007, that money being the proceeds of the importation of a quantity of cocaine by Moradian and his associates. 

General expenditure by the applicant
10The applicant's dealing in the cash included amounts spent by her in respect of: 


(i)the purchase of clothing, jewellery and watches; 
(ii)the cost of internal renovations to the premises which she shared with Moradian; 
(iii)the purchase of individual items for those premises including floor coverings, antiques, homewares, murals, ornaments, electrical and audio visual appliances and furniture; 
(iv)various costs associated with her wedding; and
(v)general living expenses.

11Some of the items referred to in (iv) above were purchased with the assistance of an interior designer, Michael Chard (""Chard""). Items purchased with Chard's assistance from the Versace store in Sydney alone totalled $652,544.00. The total amount expended on the applicant's residential premises was $975,894.00, the vast majority of those payments being made in cash.

The applicant's association with Alessio Torrelli
12Part of the Crown case in support of the first count arose out of the applicant's association with Alessio Torrelli (""Torrelli"") whom she had met some years previously. The Crown relied upon three discrete areas of dealing between the applicant and Torrelli, each of which was said to involve cash payments made by the applicant. They were as follows: 


(i)a series of ""initial payments"" to Torrelli; 
(ii)a cash payment of $910,000.00 to Torrelli; and
(iii)a further cash payment of $1,000,000.00 to Torrelli. 

13It was the dealing in (iii) which was the subject of a factual dispute on sentence. The agreed facts in relation to the dealings in (i) and (ii) may be summarised as follows.

The initial payments made by the applicant to Torrelli
14In early May 2006 the applicant gave Torrelli a sum of $10,000.00 in cash which Torrelli deposited into his bank account. In June 2006 the applicant met with Torrelli and told him that she had $20,000.00 in cash and wished to deposit that money into Torrelli's business account. She proposed that having done so, Torrelli could pay the money back to her as ""salary"" for professional services rendered by her, although there was no expectation on the part of either of them that any such services would be rendered. The applicant told Torrelli that the money came from her mother and that she would give him $1,000.00 for helping her. Torrelli agreed, and a short time later the applicant gave him $20,000.00 in cash. Torrelli later transferred amounts back into the applicant's bank account.

15Subsequently, and prior to Torrelli undertaking a trip to the United States of America, the applicant asked Torrelli to collect a watch for her from a store in New York. Torrelli agreed and the applicant gave him $10,000.00 to finalise the purchase of the watch, which he converted into US currency. Whilst in New York, Torrelli in fact purchased two watches on behalf of the applicant for a total of AUD $34,579.00. The applicant placed $18,000.00 into Torrelli's account whilst he was absent from Australia.

16Between 24 July 2006 and 1 September 2006 the applicant gave Torrelli a further amount of approximately $20,000.00 in cash. An arrangement was made between them that Torrelli would repay that money to the applicant over a period of six months. Torrelli subsequently made payments of $4,450.00, $4,750.00, $4,800.00 and $5,000.00 back to the applicant. 

The cash payment of $910,000.00 made by the applicant to Torrelli
17Following the execution of the first of two search warrants upon her residential premises, the applicant asked Torrelli if he would mind a sum of approximately $1,000,000.00 for her. Torrelli agreed and the applicant gave him a red sports bag full of cash, in which he counted 91 bundles each containing $10,000.00 in cash, covered in dirt and clay. Torrelli sought the assistance of a friend, Gabriel Maciel (""Maciel"") to clean the money and to store it. 

18At the applicant's request, Torrelli subsequently returned an amount of $400,000.00 from the original sum of $910,000.00. By agreement with the applicant, Torrelli retained an amount of $80,000.00, some of which he distributed amongst various persons, including Maciel. The balance of the original sum of $910,000.00 was later returned to the applicant's sister, at the applicant's request. 

The disputed cash payment of $1,000,000.00 made by the applicant to Torrelli
19The Crown alleged that several days after his receipt of the amount of $910,000.00 referred to in [17], Torrelli met the applicant at the Westin Hotel in Sydney where he agreed to a request from the applicant that he mind a further amount of money for her. 

20Torrelli and the applicant subsequently met at Edensor Park, at which time the applicant gave Torrelli the keys to a rental vehicle. Torrelli left in that vehicle and drove it to his mother's house. He observed that there were two suitcases in the vehicle, one containing two packages and the other containing one. All three packages contained money which Torrelli decided to bury in his mother's garden. In the course of doing so, he split one of the packages which was covered in black waterproof tape. When he did so, Torrelli saw that the packaging contained smaller packages covered in black tape.

21Torrelli later met with the applicant and returned the hire car. He then decided to remove the money from his mother's house and again contacted Maciel. Subsequently the money was stored at Maciel's premises. 

22During the course of storing the money, Torrelli and Maciel counted the bundles in the package that Torrelli had split when he was burying the money in his mother's garden. Torrelli counted 100 bundles of cash, each containing the sum of $10,000.00. It is not known how much cash was in the other two packages.

23Subsequently, arrangements were made between Torrelli and the applicant for Torrelli to hand over to the applicant the three packages which were originally in the two suitcases (as outlined in [20] above). Torrelli met with the applicant at a railway station, and gave the applicant the keys to a rental car which contained the three packages. 

The execution of search warrants on the applicant's premises
24Search warrants were executed by police on the applicant's premises on 2 March 2007 and 27 July 2007. Following the execution of the first of those warrants, the applicant met Chard and asked him to reduce the amounts of the purchases which had been made with his assistance. She told Chard that she was ""in trouble"" in respect of the amount of money that she had spent and that she was going to say that ""the purchases were made by family and friends as wedding presents"". The applicant also offered, through her sister, to pay any legal expenses which Chard might incur as a result of assisting her as she had requested. Chard subsequently re-issued invoices to the applicant in respect of the items she had purchased with his assistance, and on which the GST and/or his commission had been removed.

25A second search warrant was executed at the applicant's premises on 25 July 2007. Immediately prior to the execution of that search warrant, the applicant had attended the premises in a rental car. She was arrested and cautioned, whereupon police located a garbage bag on the back seat of the vehicle which contained twenty bundles of Australian currency. In the boot of the vehicle police located a black suit case which contained a total of thirteen bundles of Australian currency. The total amount of the currency located was $760,300.00.

26Further, as a result of the execution of the search warrants, police located cash receipts in the name of the applicant totalling $14,208.00. These receipts were referable to the payment of (inter alia) council rates, house hold items, furniture, groceries and petrol.

The second count - doing an act with intent to pervert the course of justice (Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) s. 319)
27On 7 May 2007 Torrelli was served with a summons to give evidence before the New South Wales Crime Commission (""the Commission""). After receiving that summons, Torrelli contacted the applicant and arranged a meeting with her. At that meeting the applicant and Torrelli discussed Torrelli's appearance before the Commission. Torrelli told the applicant that he would give evidence that the applicant had once been employed by him. 

28It should be noted that in 2004, the applicant and Torrelli (along with a third person) had attempted to set up a consulting business known as Fusion Technology Services. The business was largely a failure. To the extent that the business generated any income at all, it was minimal, and was derived from the efforts of Torrelli, at a time after the applicant's association with the business had ceased. At no stage did the applicant do any paid work for the business.

29Torrelli later gave evidence to the Commission in accordance with his earlier indication to the applicant. Having done so, he contacted the applicant and advised her of what he had said. 

30Torrelli was later served with a Notice to Produce documents in relation to the work allegedly completed by the applicant for him. Torrelli contacted the applicant and she provided him with a number of invoices totalling $35,700.00, and which purported to outline work she had performed for Fusion Technology Services. Torrelli gave these documents to the police in response to the Notice to Produce. 

The third count - giving evidence before the New South Wales Crime Commission which was, to the knowledge of the applicant, false in a material particular (New South Wales Crime Commission Act s. 20(1)) 
31On 14 May 2007, the applicant gave evidence before the Commission. She was legally represented on that occasion, took an oath to tell the truth, and was warned that she may be prosecuted in relation to any false or misleading evidence that she gave. The applicant was also warned that she must not discuss any evidence she gave before the Commission.

32In the course of her evidence, the applicant was asked questions regarding the movements of herself and Moradian during the period following the execution of the first search warrant on their residential premises. The applicant gave evidence that she had left her residential premises around that time and had resided at 'various hotels in the city' including the Shangri La Hotel. That hotel was one at which the applicant had stayed between 12 and 15 January 2007, at the time of her wedding. The bill for that stay amounted to $8,123.50, which was paid by the applicant in cash. That payment formed part of the evidence in support of the first count. 


33The applicant was questioned about the movements of Moradian at various times and, in effect, told the Commission that she was not sure of his whereabouts. Evidence obtained from listening devices and telephone intercepts established that at the time of giving this evidence, the applicant was in fact residing with Moradian at Manly. 

The fourth count - conducting transactions to avoid reporting requirements (Financial Transactions Reports Act 1988 s. 31(1))
34The applicant had a bank account solely in her name with the St George Bank, and a joint account with her sister Tanya at the ANZ Bank. During the period between 1 December 2005 and 31 May 2006 the applicant made 41 cash deposits totaling $386,172.75, such deposits being in amounts between $9,000.00 and $9,900.00. It is noted that although the facts before his Honour made reference to 37 transactions, there were 41 set out in an accompanying table. In his reasons for sentence, his Honour adopted the latter figure.

THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL
Ground 1 - the sentencing judge erred in admitting into evidence the statement of Alessio Torrelli
35After giving evidence before the Commission, Torrelli provided an induced statement to the police dealing with a number of aspects of his relationship with the applicant, including the circumstances of the disputed payment of $1,000,000.00 upon which the Crown relied. Despite being served with a subpoena to attend the sentence proceedings and give evidence, he failed to do so. Although the sentencing judge issued a warrant for Torrelli's arrest, that warrant could not be executed. 

36In Torrelli's absence, the Crown made an application to the sentencing judge to tender his statement pursuant to the provisions of s. 65(2)(b) and/or 65(2)(d) of the Evidence Act (""the Act""). To the extent relevant for present purposes, s. 65 of the Act is in the following terms:

Exception: criminal proceedings if maker not available 
(1) This section applies in a criminal proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is not available to give evidence about an asserted fact. 

(2)The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, if the representation: 

(a) was made under a duty to make that representation or to make representations of that kind; or 

(b) was made when or shortly after the asserted fact occurred and in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a fabrication; or 

(c) was made in circumstances that make it highly probable that the representation is reliable; or 

(d) was: 
(i) against the interests of the person who made it at the time it was made; and 
(ii) made in circumstances that make it likely that the representation is reliable. 

37Also relevant to the Crown's application were the provisions of s. 137 of the Act which are in the following terms:

Exclusion of prejudicial evidence in criminal proceedings 

In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. 


38For the purposes of the Crown's application, senior counsel who appeared for the applicant at sentence conceded that:

(b)the Crown had given notice of the application under s. 67 of the Act;

(c)Torrelli was ""not available"" to give evidence (s. 65(1)); and

(d)the relevant representations were:

(i)made shortly after the asserted facts had occurred (s. 65(2)(b)); and
(ii)against the interests of Torrelli when he made them (s. 65(2)(d)).

39Accordingly, the issues for determination by his Honour were whether Torrelli's representations were made in circumstances:

(i)that made it unlikely that they were a fabrication (s. 65(2)(b)); or

(ii)that made it likely that they were reliable (s. 65(2)(d)). 

His Honour's judgment
40In delivering judgment (R v Natasha Youkhana [2011] NSWDC 204) his Honour noted the concessions made on behalf of the applicant and also noted that in the event that he determined the application in favour of the Crown, a secondary issue would arise as to whether s. 137 of the Act warranted the exclusion of the representations. 

41Having set out the submissions of the parties, his Honour turned (at [19]) to the provisions of s. 65(2)(b):

""In my opinion Mr Torrelli, although he clearly is avoiding service, made a statement soon after the event in circumstances where he had been given an opportunity to avoid prosecution if he made a clear, verifiable and reliable account of his dealings with Ms Youkhana. The contents of the statement as far as his non-criminal relationship with Ms Youkhana were verifiable, as were payments, bank transfers and the like, which are evidenced by the annexures to the statement used by him in its preparation. He was, having previously lied to the Crime Commission, given an opportunity to be as accurate as he could, knowing that what he said would, and could, be checked. In those circumstances I find it unlikely what he said in the statement/representation (Exhibit Voir Dire D) was fabricated.""

42His Honour then turned (at [20]) to the provisions of s. 65(2)(d):

""As to the alternative test in s 65(2)(d), the statement clearly was against interest, a fact which is not contested by Mr Boulten. It is also, given the fact that it was, and could be, checked, made in circumstances that make it likely it is reliable. Clearly, the statement must be read with an understanding that, reliable or not, there was a clear motivation to downplay the extent of his involvement and exaggerate the culpability of others. That, of itself, does not cause me to reject its admission.""

43Having reached these conclusions his Honour then moved at [21] - [23]) to consider the application of s. 137 of the Act:

""These are clearly criminal proceedings and I have directed that the Evidence Act applied. I must weigh the probative value of the evidence against the danger of unfair prejudice which I note requires me to measure what are in fact incommensurables. That is not an unusual task given a judge. I must look to the evidence, the particulars of the case and use experience of the Court. 

[22] It is clear that the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of a fact in issue and, if admitted, has considerable probative value: here, the extent to which Ms Youkhana dealt with the proceeds of crime. I must weigh against that the dangers I will use the evidence on some improper basis or unconnected with the issues of the case or in a way, for example, that would cause me to be satisfied to a lower degree of probability than would otherwise be required: see ALRC (1985) No 26 Vol 1 at [644]. Clearly, if the prosecution is to rely upon the statement it must, when weighed with all the other evidence, establish beyond reasonable doubt the extent to which Ms Youkhana dealt with the proceeds of crime before it can be applied as a matter in aggravation of the sentence I must impose. 

[23] I am aware of the potential for improper use but I am also aware of the statement's significant probative value when it comes to my assessment of the overall gravity of the offending behaviour the subject of these sentence proceedings. The evidence is significant, it is probative, and the danger of unfair prejudice, with respect to Mr Boulten's submissions to the contrary, is unlikely. In the circumstances I propose to admit the statement of Mr Torrelli."" 
 
The submissions of the parties 
44For the purposes of this ground, as well as for the purposes of Ground 2, senior counsel for the applicant acknowledged the restrictions which are placed upon an appellate court in interfering with factual findings which are reached by a sentencing judge. Senior counsel acknowledged, in particular, that this Court is bound by his Honour's findings of fact unless it could be established that such findings were not open on the evidence, or unless some other error could be demonstrated in the sense referred to in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 (see Hopley v R [2008] NSWCCA 105 per Johnson J at [28] and the authorities cited therein). Bearing in mind those principles, senior counsel made a number of submissions. 

45Firstly, he relied on the fact that when giving evidence before the Commission, Torrelli had denied that the applicant had provided him with the sum of $1,000,000.00 as alleged by the Crown, only to later admit in his statement that such evidence was false. He also submitted that it was relevant that there was no evidence before his Honour of the circumstances in which Torrelli had made his statement and that, more specifically, there was no evidence which might explain why Torrelli had changed his position from that which he adopted when giving evidence before the Commission. He also relied on the fact that when giving evidence before the Commission, Torrelli was questioned by a police officer who himself had since been convicted of serious criminal offences. 

46Senior counsel further submitted that Torrelli had an obvious incentive to exaggerate the involvement of the applicant. He pointed to the fact that Torrelli was an ""informer"" and submitted that this circumstance necessarily affected his reliability. All of these circumstances, he submitted, attracted the application of s. 165 of the Act. 


47Finally, senior counsel submitted that the evidence did not permit the sentencing judge to find that:

(a)Torrelli was aware that the contents of his statement could be checked and verified;

(b)Torrelli's statement had been made in circumstances that made it reliable; and

(c)the likelihood of the entirety of the statement being reliable was demonstrated by the fact that the statement contained evidence which was not disputed by the applicant and which was consistent, at least in part, with her pleas of guilty.

48Senior counsel for the Crown submitted that no error had been made out. Firstly, he submitted that the circumstances in which Torrelli's statement had been made were, to the extent that they were relevant, set out in the statement itself. In respect of the provisions of s. 165 of the Act, the Crown submitted that his Honour was necessarily aware of the fact that Torrelli was an ""informer"", and that it was clear that his Honour had given himself the relevant warning which was required by that section. The Crown further submitted that the mere fact that the circumstances may have attracted the application of s. 165 did not mandate the exclusion of the evidence.

49Finally, the Crown submitted that in circumstances where Torrelli had given evidence before the Commission, and was thus aware of the fact he was under investigation, he would necessarily have been aware of the Commission's ability to check such assertions as he might make in any statement. In this regard, the Crown submitted that nothing whatsoever turned on the fact that the person who questioned Torrelli during the course of his evidence before the Commission had since been convicted of serious criminal offences. 

50In all of these circumstances the Crown submitted that his Honour's conclusions in respect of both s. 65(2)(b) and (d) were open. 
 
Consideration and conclusion
51In dealing with the provisions of s. 65(2)(b), and in light of the concessions made on behalf of the applicant, his Honour (at [15] of his judgment) correctly identified the issue as being whether the representations contained in Torrelli's statement were made in circumstances which rendered it unlikely that they were a fabrication. The circumstances which his Honour was entitled to take into account in determining that issue included events outside the time and place of the making of the representations (see R v Ambrosoli (2002) 55 NSWLR 603; [2002] NSWCCA 386 at 616; [37]). 

52In reaching his conclusion, his Honour had regard to the fact that:

(i)aspects of the statement which dealt with Torrelli's ""non criminal"" relationship with the applicant were capable of independent verification;

(ii)other assertions in the statement were verified by various accounting documents which were annexed to it, and 

(iii)Torrelli, having previously told untruths to the Commission, had been provided with an opportunity to make a statement, in the knowledge that the contents of such statement could, and would, be checked by the Commission.

53In my view, these were all relevant considerations which supported the conclusion that the requirements of s. 65(2)(b) had been met. 

54Although it was not determinative of the issue that his Honour had to decide for the purposes of s. 65(2)(b), the fact that various aspects of Torrelli's statement were either not put in issue by the applicant, or were independently verified, supported the conclusion that his Honour reached. Torrelli must have been aware, as a result of his appearance before the Commission that his assertions could, and would, be checked. In particular, he must also have been aware of the likelihood that the Commission would approach Maciel (as in fact occurred) to obtain a statement concerning those matters in which Torrelli had implicated him. 
 
55Although his Honour did not expressly refer to it, Torrelli's awareness that his assertions would be checked was evident from his acknowledgement (in paragraphs (2) and (3) of his statement) that he would be liable to prosecution if he wilfully stated anything which he knew to be false, or did not believe to be true. This court has previously observed that an acknowledgement in those terms is a circumstance capable of supporting the conclusion that his Honour reached in the present case in terms of s. 65(2)(b) (see Harris v R [2005] NSWCCA 432 per Studdert J at [44] - [45], Grove and Whealy JJ agreeing). 

56His Honour was obviously aware that prior to making the statement Torrelli had given evidence on oath to the Commission which, in light of his statement, was at least partially false. That was obviously a relevant consideration, but it was not one which was, of itself, determinative of the issue which his Honour had to decide. Further, and contrary to the submission advanced on behalf of the applicant, there was evidence (in paragraphs [78] and [79] of the statement) of the circumstances in which that statement had come into existence. There was also evidence (in paragraph [81]) of the reasons advanced by Torrelli for giving false evidence to the Commission. They were all matters of which his Honour was obviously aware, and which he took into account. 

57In my view, the fact that the officer who questioned Torrelli at the Commission has, since that time, himself been convicted of serious criminal offences had little or no bearing upon the issue which his Honour was required to determine. In the course of oral submissions, senior counsel for the applicant went some way to acknowledging that this was the case, although he submitted that the fact that the person in question was not available to give evidence about various matters surrounding the circumstances in which the statement was made remained of some relevance. As I have noted, the statement itself set out those circumstances. No further evidence was required in relation to them.

58For these reasons, I am of the view that it was open to his Honour to find, in accordance with s. 65(2)(b) of the Act, that Torrelli's representations were made in circumstances that made it unlikely that they were a fabrication. 

59Further, in my view, his Honour's conclusions in relation to the provisions of s. 65(2)(d) were similarly open. It is evident from his Honour's judgment that he was mindful of the possibility of Torrelli being motivated, out of self interest, to exaggerate the role of others whilst downplaying his own. However, having considered that issue, his Honour concluded that this, of itself, did not provide reason to reject the statement. 
 
60His Honour clearly took into account Torrelli's awareness of the fact that his assertions would be checked by the Commission. For the reasons I have previously set out, that was a relevant consideration, and one which supported his Honour's conclusions. 

61The fact that (to use the terminology adopted by senior counsel for the applicant) Torrelli was an ""informer"" necessarily had a bearing upon the issue of reliability. His honour was clearly aware of that circumstance and, contrary to what was advanced on behalf of the applicant in the written submissions, the application of s. 165 did not mandate the conclusion that Torrelli's representations were unreliable. 

62Finally, having reached his conclusions in respect of ss. 65(2)(b) and (d), his Honour considered the provisions of s. 137. It is clear from his Honour's judgment (at [21] - [22]) that in doing so, he performed the necessary balancing (as to which see R v Blick (2000) 111 A Crim R 326; [2000] NSWCCA 61) and concluded that the evidence was probative, and that the danger of unfair prejudice was unlikely. No error has been established in that regard. 

63For these reasons, Ground 1 has not been made out. 

Ground 2 - the sentencing Judge erred in finding that the applicant provided Torrelli with $1,000,000.00 in cash at the Westin Hotel and/or by finding the disputed paragraphs 38-44 of the Agreed Facts proven beyond reasonable doubt.
His Honour's judgment
64As previously outlined, the applicant disputed Torrelli's assertion that she gave him $1,000,000.00 in cash. In his reasons for sentence (at AB 26-27) his Honour reached the following conclusions concerning this issue: 

""Given the material which is before me in relation to the sums of cash available to Mr Moradian, given that the offender's sister, despite having no feelings for Mr Moradian, agreed to help her sister, the offender, by hiding Mr Moradian's cash, given that Mr Torrelli had no reason to exaggerate the amount of cash with which he dealt with (sic), his evidence, supported as it is by others such as Ms Bitzmirza and Mr Maciel, can be accepted.

When the offender gave evidence about these issues she did seek to minimise her knowledge of the amount of cash, which she agrees she took initially to her parents and induced Mr Torrelli to mind on her behalf. She also gave an unconvincing account of the return of cash payments. Her evidence on this matter was simply unbelievable. The offender told me that she did arrange for Mr Torrelli to launder some money and that she did give him $20,000.00 to make an overseas purchase of a watch on behalf of her husband. She did give him a bag of money which she had taken to her parents' place, presumably to hide there. She was at the time so desperate she contemplated risking leaving money with her aged parents. Whilst, as Mr Boulten points out, it is hypothetically possible that Mr Torrelli hid about $1,000,000.00 at the direct instigation of Mr Moradian without the intervention of the offender, this is so unlikely that I discount it. In all the circumstances, the evidence establishes beyond reasonable doubt that in order to assist her husband dispose of large sums of cash, knowing that the New South Wales Police and Crime Commission officers had raided co-offenders and were in closing in on her husband, she chose to assist him by manipulating her friend, Mr Torrelli into assisting her husband, and thereby herself, as part of the marriage partnership. When I consider all the material before me I accept the Crown's submission and what is set out in Mr Torrelli's statement (Exhibit G) and summarised in Exhibit A paras [29] - [44].

These findings support important conclusions:

the offender was actively involved in seeking to hide large sums of her husband's illicit cash from May 2006 to mid 2007;

the offender played a significant role in inducing others' involvement in the hiding of this cash; and 

the offender was prepared to engage in numerous cash transactions for her and her husband's individual and mutual benefit.""

The submissions of the parties
65In support of this ground, and in addition to the matters advanced in support of Ground 1, senior counsel for the applicant submitted that there was an inconsistency between the sentencing judge's findings in his judgment concerning the admissibility of Torrelli's representations, and his findings in his reasons for sentence. In this regard he drew attention to the fact that at paragraph [20] of his judgment concerning the question of admissibility, his Honour said:

""Clearly, the statement must be read with an understanding that, reliable or not, there was a clear motivation to down play the extent of his involvement and exaggerate the culpability of others"" 


66Senior counsel submitted that this was inconsistent with that part of his Honour's reasons for sentence set out in [64] above where his Honour concluded that Torrelli: 

""had no reason to exaggerate the amount of cash with which he dealt....""

67Secondly, senior counsel submitted that his Honour's conclusions were reached ""despite the provisions of s. 165 of the Act"", and in the absence of any cross examination of Torrelli.


68Finally, senior counsel submitted that His honour's conclusions were against the weight of, and unreasonable and unjust in light of, the evidence. In this regard, senior counsel submitted that his Honour failed to give appropriate weight and consideration to the evidence of the applicant. 

69Senior counsel for the Crown relied on the submission made in respect of Ground 1 concerning the applicant's awareness of the fact that his various assertions could, and would, be checked by the Commission. The Crown also relied on the submission made in respect of Ground 1 in relation to the application of s. 165 of the Act. 


70The Crown pointed out that not only was no issue taken by the applicant in relation to a number of aspects of Torrelli's statement, some of Torrelli's assertions concerning the disputed facts were specifically supported by other evidence. In this respect, the Crown pointed to the statement of Maciel, which was admitted in the sentence proceedings without objection, and which supported Torrelli in a number of important respects. All of these matters, the Crown submitted, were available to be taken into account by his Honour in reaching his conclusion.


71Finally, the Crown submitted that it was clear that his Honour had regard to the applicant's evidence, and had concluded that it was ""unconvincing"" and ""unbelievable"". These, the Crown submitted, were findings which were within the province of the sentencing judge, and which were clearly open to him. 


Consideration and conclusion 
72His Honour's conclusion that he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the disputed facts was, in my view, one which was clearly open on the evidence and no error in his Honour's reasoning has been demonstrated.

73Firstly, and properly read, a comparison of his Honour's reasons exhibits no inconsistency. His Honour's observations about Torrelli's motivation, set out in his judgment on the admissibility question, were made in the context of the issue which arose in terms of s. 65(2)(d) of the Act. He concluded that despite the existence of such motivation, he was satisfied that the representations were reliable. A conclusion that the representations were reliable is not inconsistent with a conclusion that Torrelli had no reason to exaggerate the amount of cash with which he dealt. 

74The further submission that error is demonstrated because his Honour was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the disputed facts:


(i)despite the provisions of s. 165 of the Act; and 
(ii)in the absence of cross examination of Torrelli

cannot be accepted. Apart from any other consideration, the submission overlooks two important factors. 

75Firstly, to the extent that the submission suggests that the application of s. 165 should have mandated a different conclusion overlooks the terms of s. 165(2). The terms of the warning which his Honour was asked to (and did) give himself, was a warning of possible unreliability, and of the need for caution in determining whether or not the evidence ought be accepted and, if so, what weight would be given to it. The mere fact that the circumstances called for the application of s. 165 did not mean that the evidence was to be automatically rejected. 

76Secondly, the submission fails to have regard to the fact that admission of a representation pursuant to s. 65(2)(b) or (d) will, by its very nature, occur in circumstances where the maker of the representation is not available. There will, as a result, be no cross examination. If the absence of cross examination were a ground for the ultimate rejection of evidence to which s. 65(2)(b) or (d) were held to apply, those provisions would, in large measure, be rendered nugatory. 

77Finally, the submissions advanced on behalf of the applicant that:


(i)Torrelli's representations were against the weight of the evidence;
(ii)the result was unreasonable and unjust in light of the whole of the evidence; and 
(iii)the applicant's evidence on oath denying the disputed paragraphs of Torrelli's statement was not given appropriate weight or consideration by the sentencing judge,

should all be rejected. 

78The applicant took no issue at all with the vast majority of Torrelli's assertions, including those parts of his statement which detailed the making of the initial payments, as well as the payment of $910,000.00. Moreover, those matters asserted by Torrelli which were in dispute were supported in a number of material respects by the unchallenged evidence of Maciel. His Honour was entitled to have regard to all of those matters. In these circumstances, and contrary to the submission advanced on behalf of the applicant, the weight of the evidence supported those conclusions. 

79Further, it is evident from his reasons that his Honour gave close consideration to the evidence given by the applicant. Having done so, he concluded that such evidence ought not be accepted. The acceptance or rejection of the evidence given in the sentence proceedings was a matter for his Honour and no error has been demonstrated in that regard. 


80It follows that in my view, this ground is not made out.

Ground 3 - The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance by virtue of the disparity between the sentence imposed on her and that imposed upon Tanya Youkhana.
The sentences imposed by his Honour on Tanya Youkhana
81The applicant's sister, Tanya Youkhana, was sentenced by his Honour on 22 February 2011 (R v Tanya Youkhana [2011] NSWDC 63) in respect of two offences, namely:

(i)knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime contrary to s. 193B(2) of the Crimes Act; and

(ii)conducting transactions to avoid reporting requirement contrary to s. 31(1) of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 (""the FTRA"").


82The first offence involved burying an amount of $2,730,390.00 which she had obtained from Moradian and his associates. In relation to this matter she was sentenced to a non-parole period of 1 year and 6 months imprisonment, to commence on 13 February 2011 and to expire on 12 August 2012 with a parole period of 6 months to date from 13 August 2012 and to expire on 12 February 2013. 

83The second offence involved the making of 38 cash deposits, each between $9,000.00 and $9,900.00, into various bank accounts during the period 22 January 2006 and 7 November 2006. The total amount of those deposits was $347,207.51. In relation to this matter she was sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 1 year to commence on 22 February 2011 and to expire on 21 February 2012. His Honour directed that in relation to that matter she be released forthwith upon entering into a bond pursuant to s. 20(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) to be of good behavior for a period of 1 year and to appear for sentence if called upon. As his Honour pointed out (at [56] of his judgment) had the second matter been the only offence before the court, the applicant's sister would have been given a suspended sentence of 1 year.

84In dealing with this ground, and in light of the submissions made on behalf of the applicant, it should be noted that in his reasons (at AB 20) his Honour said (in relation to the fourth count):

""(The applicant's) offending began when she agreed to commit the offences regarding avoiding of reporting requirements. It is clear that she was aware that the source of the money was illicit. She did so to launder money which was to be used as the deposit for the home she and Mr Moradian intended to buy. She involved her sister in this offence"" (emphasis added).


85Later, and again in reference to the fourth count, his Honour said (at AB 28):

""The offence was relatively unsophisticated. She used her own accounts and I accept she was not, at this stage, aware of how criminal her behaviour was. Nevertheless, the sum involved was a substantial one, $386,172.15. There were forty-one transactions and, as I have said, she involved her sister in this offence"" (emphasis added).

86Importantly, no issue was taken on the hearing of this appeal with his Honour's conclusion that it was the applicant who involved her sister in the offending under the FTRA.

The submissions of the parties
87Senior counsel for the applicant submitted that the sentencing judge did not provide reasons why, in sentencing the applicant, he had chosen to depart from the sentence which had been imposed upon her sister. He further submitted that in these circumstances, the applicant had a justifiable sense of grievance by virtue of what was said to be the disparity between the sentence imposed upon her and that imposed upon her sister. 

88In support of these submissions, reliance was placed upon the fact that in the applicant's case, the total of the deposits involved in the offence contrary to the FTRA was $386,172.15, arising from 41transactions In comparison, the offence against the FTRA committed by the applicant's sister involved 38 cash deposits totaling a sum of $347,207.51. It was further submitted that the subjective circumstances of the applicant and her sister were not different in any material respect.


89The Crown submitted that when his Honour's reasons were read as a whole, it was apparent that his Honour did have regard to the sentences which had been imposed upon others who had been charged as a result of the investigation. The Crown submitted that having done so, his Honour had correctly concluded that the applicant's overall offending was different and, importantly, far more extensive. 

90The Crown submitted that when sentencing the applicant his Honour correctly had regard to considerations of totality and that in circumstances where the applicant's offending extended well beyond that of her sister, no justifiable sense of grievance could be made out. 


91The Crown further submitted that even if a comparison of the offending of the applicant and her sister was limited to the offending under the FTRA, the criminality of the applicant was greater, such that she could have no justifiable sense of grievance arising from the respective sentences which were imposed.

Consideration and conclusion
92The submission that the sentencing judge did not provide reasons for departing from the sentence imposed upon the applicant's sister cannot, in the light of his Honour's reasons, be accepted. In particular, his Honour said (at AB 34-35):

""I have regard to the sentences imposed on others involved in Operation Schoale , particularly those who warehoused or otherwise dealt with the enormous sums of money involved. 

Sentences must be individual and the offender's crimes are different than the others. Nevertheless, where possible, a degree of proportionality must be maintained as between those involved in the same criminal enterprise and engaged in similar criminal activity. There can, however, be no direct parity between this offender and others as their crimes were quite distinct from hers.

I must consider each offence separately and also look at the totality of offending. While proper individual sentences must be imposed, the aggregate sentence must also be just and appropriate.""

93That passage makes it clear that his Honour was mindful of the sentences imposed upon those ""others"" who had been arrested in the course of the investigation (of whom the applicant's sister was one). That passage also makes it clear that his Honour, quite correctly, came to the view that the applicant's offending extended well beyond that of her sister. Quite properly, those considerations played a significant part in his Honour sentencing the applicant as he did.

94His Honour was obviously aware that the applicant and her sister were each charged with an offence under the FTRA. He was also aware of the fact that in that respect, the nature of their respective offending was similar, and that it arose, in broad terms, from the one set of circumstances. Equally, as his Honour acknowledged, the applicant's offending extended well beyond the commission of the offence contrary to the FTRA. His Honour was, quite properly, mindful of that fact, and thus mindful of considerations of totality of sentence. 

95His Honour also made a number of findings which were favorable to the applicant's sister. In particular, he found:

(i)that her involvement with Moradian was limited to her commission of the two offences to which she had pleaded guilty, and that she did not actively involve herself in the extended crimes in which others (including the applicant) engaged; 

(ii)that her commission of the offences showed considerable naivety; and

(iii)that she accepted responsibility for her actions.


96In comparison, his Honour found (at AB 20; 27-28) that the applicant:

(i)was responsible for involving her sister in the commission of the offence under the FTRA;

(ii)was actively involved in seeking to hide large sums of Moradian's illicit cash over a period from May 2006 to mid 2007; and

(iii)played a significant role in inducing the involvement of other persons in the secretion of the cash. 

97None of these findings are challenged. They serve to draw a number of important distinctions between the applicant's offending, and that of her sister, and support the conclusion that the applicant's offending was far more extensive, and her criminality far greater. 

98Finally, even when a comparison between the applicant's offending and that of her sister is limited to the circumstances surrounding the commission of their respective offences against the FTRA, the submission that the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance cannot be made out. True it is that the number of transactions in each case was comparable, as was the period over which the respective offences were committed. However, in the case of the applicant, the amount of money which was the subject of the charge was almost $40,000.00 in excess of that which applied to the charge laid against her sister. Moreover, as his Honour found, it was the applicant who involved her sister in that offending. Those circumstances, without more, rendered the applicant's criminality greater than that of her sister, thereby justifying the imposition of a harsher sentence.

99For all of these reasons, this ground is not made out.

ORDERS
100For the reasons set out above, I propose the following orders:

(i)leave to appeal granted;
(ii)appeal dismissed.

2706875,R v Daley [2013] NSWDC 76,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: Appearing for sentence today is Christopher Daley. Proceedings have been a bit disjointed, but the matter is now in a position where I can now impose sentence upon him. 

2He has pleaded guilty to an offence of supplying a prohibited drug and escaping lawful custody. One of the reasons for the matter being disjointed was that I asked Mr Ferrick, who appears for Mr Daley, and the Crown to conduct some research as to whether a common law offence for escape needed to be imposed cumulatively on any other sentence. It was the joint position of the parties after doing that research that there was no such obligation.

3The escape lawful custody matter has another curiosity which I should mention. It is on a s 166 certificate. Mr Daley was not committed for sentence on that charge to this Court. In those circumstances there is a jurisdictional maximum of two years for that sentence. Another reason for the matter being disjointed concerned some difficulty in initially at least ascertaining the factual basis on which I would sentence Mr Daley. I will explain what I mean as I set out the facts on which he is to be sentenced.

4At about 1am on Sunday 29 April, police were conducting a drug dog operation involving drug detection dog Asta. Police watched the offender. They saw him look directly at police and the drug detection dog before separating from the male he was with and walking rapidly away. Having alerted police to his presence and acting suspiciously in that way, police formed the opinion, accurately as it turned out, that Mr Daley was in possession of prohibited drugs. They therefore stopped him. 

5They discovered $965 in his possession. He told police that it was a friend's twenty-first and he was holding the money for a number of different friends. As it turns out he asks that I take into account an offence of dealing with $965 suspected to be the proceeds of crime when I sentence him for the drug supply offence.

6Police also found an Apple iPhone in his pocket. At their request he provided police with the pass code to open the phone. Police then searched through the phone and in particular looked at text messages sent from the phone and received by it. Some of them clearly relate to drug supply either to Mr Daley or by him. He was therefore arrested and was taken back to Kings Cross police station.

7On reaching the police station the attitude of Mr Daley, which until then had been cooperative, changed. He ran away. He was chased and apprehended a short distance away. He was then taken back to the police station, in handcuffs this time, where he was searched. Police discovered a plastic bag containing thirty-two pink-coloured tablets which proved to be ecstasy and a small, resealable plastic bag which was found to contain amphetamine, not methylamphetamine. The possession of that drug is also on a Form 1. 

8Mr Daley then told police that the drugs were for this own use although he did say that on an earlier occasion he had supplied one pill each to two of his friends but not in exchange for any money. 

9When the matter was first before me this morning it was on that basis that I was asked to sentence Mr Daley, that is, that his acts of supply were limited to giving one pill each to two of his friends, those transactions not involving any payment. However, I was concerned because the statement of facts prepared by police suggested that that relative exculpatory version was inconsistent with the contents of the text messages on Mr Daley's iPhone. I raised the matter with the Crown and in response she, after a short adjournment, tendered a series of screenshots of an Apple iPhone in which drug supply activities are clearly discussed. 

10It is obvious that Mr Daley has supplied drugs to a person known in the iPhone as Kiwi Michael. Kiwi Michael has travelled some distance to Kings Cross police station in order to receive drugs from the offender. Somewhat ironically one of the messages sent by the offender to Kiwi Michael reads ""Just be careful bro, dog at station"". The text messages go on with the offender making it clear to Kiwi Michael that he wanted to make sure that he, that is Kiwi Michael, was not heading back with drugs in his possession to the station while the dog was there. 

11There are also other text messages, this time involving a person known as Ben Stephens. It is apparent from those messages that Mr Daley has purchased 120 ecstasy tablets. When Mr Daley was in the witness box he was asked what happened to those. He said that he had taken them to a hotel room which was one of three that was occupied by him and a number of his mates and that the thirty-two he was found in possession of by the police represented a portion of the drugs purchased from Ben Stephens. Some of the remainder he said he supplied to some of his mates in the hotel rooms and he is not sure what happened to the rest.

12So this is quite a different matter from the way it was initially presented to me. I am not going to sentence Mr Daley on the basis that his drug activities were limited to giving one pill to each of his two friends. The text messages are important in making it clear what Mr Daley was going to do with the thirty-two pills. And his evidence was clear that he had supplied to his friends pills other than the ones he mentioned to police. 

13Mr Daley clearly supplied a significant quantity of drugs to his friends. Precisely how much of course I cannot determine but given that he bought 120 and that there were a large number of mates it is obvious that he supplied a large number as well. 

14Nor can I find that that act of supply was isolated. Indeed, I find that the offender supplied Kiwi Michael a quantity of drugs such as to make it worthwhile for Kiwi Michael to travel for forty minutes to meet up with the offender. And I am satisfied also that that was a supply in which the offender was paid money. This was not simply handing over a small quantity of drugs to his cousin's friend at all. I do not think that Mr Daley realises quite how involved in the drug scene he was and how involved in drug supply activities he was as well. 

15One matter I will say in the offender's favour is that there is no evidence that he received payment for the particular drugs that he handed over to his mates. The $965 in his possession, which was the subject of the matter on the Form 1, at least all or part of it was related to an earlier supply, perhaps the one to Kiwi Michael. 

16There was nothing in the offender's background which would suggest that he had a particularly hard upbringing. Although his parents separated, he has been cared for by one or both of his parents as he grew up. There was a period where his relationship broke down with his mother and he went to live with his father and his father's partner. He now lives with his grandmother in the Campbelltown area. He completed year 12 and has been employed since then. At the time of his arrest he was a furniture removalist earning $700 a week. 

17He said that he commenced using drugs when he was about nineteen and would take, he told the Parole Service, up to four pills (but he told me five to six pills) a night as part of the nightclub scene with which he was involved. 

18It is clear that the author of the pre-sentence report was impressed with Mr Daley. Unfortunately, I am not as impressed. It is clear Mr Daley was less than frank with me about some of his activities, in particular the suggestion that he had supplied Kiwi Michael with a very small number of pills and no money was involved. Mr Daley was also less than frank with police. 

19The Court of Criminal Appeal tells all judges, that where an offender is trafficking to a substantial degree full-time imprisonment is the only possible sentence unless there are exceptional circumstances. Although the matter is close, I cannot find that he was trafficking to a substantial degree. He did supply Kiwi Michael on an earlier occasion but, as I have said, I am not going to make a finding that his supplies to his mates was for money. That means that Mr Daley does not have to demonstrate exceptional circumstances before a sentence of other than full-time custody being imposed. 

20But I am satisfied that a custodial sentence of some form is required. I am satisfied that is likely to be less than two years. It would be appropriate that the offender be assessed by the Department of Corrective Services as to his suitability to serve that sentence by way of an intensive corrections order. 

21The offender's involvement in what I will call the drug scene was significant. His supply activities although limited to giving them to his mates were also significant. This was a large quantity of tablets that Mr Daley was involved with. 

22There are suggestions that he has not used illicit drugs in the past six months. That is an encouraging sign. But given Mr Daley's less than frank evidence, I am not at all sure that he is telling the truth when he told the Probation and Parole Service as he did, that he had given up drugs. There needs to be an element of personal deterrence in the sentence I impose upon Mr Daley. There needs to be an element of general deterrence so that others who might be tempted to get involved in drug supply in the same way Mr Daley has might think whether it is such a good idea given the consequences for them if they are detected. Those are the reasons that a custodial sentence is required and also the reasons that if qualified Mr Daley should serve his sentence by way of a intensive corrections order. 

23Let me set a date. 31 May at 2 o'clock. The order I make is this. I confirm he's to do an assessment as to his suitability for an intensive corrections order. I grant him bail for that purpose and adjourn the matter until 31 May in order to determine whether he is suitable to serve his sentence by that means. I'll order a transcript of my remarks so far. 

24Mr Daley, what's going to happen is that you'll have to make arrangements to speak to Corrective Services. They'll assess you for an intensive corrections order. Have you heard what they are?

25OFFENDER: No. 

26HIS HONOUR: They're not easy but they're much easier than going back to gaol. Given that I've decided a custodial sentence is required if you're not suitable for one of these orders, there's a real risk that you will be going to gaol. So it's important that you cooperate as you have done with Corrective Services in the assessment process. It's also important you tell them the truth because if things come out later you might find yourself much worse off. Do you understand?

27Thank you, Madam Crown, thank you Mr Ferrick.

		29 May 2013",2013-04-17 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2706881,Nair v R [2013] NSWCCA 79,"Judgment
1BASTEN JA:  The applicant was a medical practitioner and specialist neurosurgeon.  On 26 August 2011 he was sentenced in the District Court, by Judge Toner SC, on two counts of supply cocaine and one of manslaughter where a young woman supplying sexual services died after ingesting cocaine supplied by the applicant.  He is now serving a sentence of a little less than eight years imprisonment, with a period of five years, three months and 22 days mandatory custody.
2The application for leave to appeal was not filed until 25 October 2012.  The background to the application is to be found in the judgment of Blanch J.  Subject to what follows, I agree with the conclusions reached by Blanch J, although the qualifications would require some variation to the proposed orders.
Procedural unfairness3The first proposed ground of appeal is a complaint of denial of procedural fairness in the imposition of a custodial sentence on count 1.  Count 1 involved the supply of cocaine on 15 February 2009 to Victoria McIntyre, a woman providing sexual services to the applicant.  Toner DCJ sentenced the applicant on that count to a term of imprisonment of two years and three months.  The complaint was that, in the course of hearing submissions from counsel for the offender, he indicated an intention to impose a non-custodial sentence.
4The gravamen of such a complaint is that where a judge indicates that he or she proposes to take a particular course, favourable to one party, but then takes a less favourable course, the party affected has been deprived of an opportunity to make submissions in favour of leniency, thinking that to be unnecessary.  That such circumstances may involve a denial of procedural fairness is uncontroversial: see Parker v Director of Public Prosecutions (1992) 28 NSWLR 282.  The more difficult question is whether such a complaint is justified in particular circumstances.
5In the present case, counsel for the offender addressed the trial judge at some length in respect of the first count, in support of the submission that no effective penalty should be imposed, relying on the decision of R v Wilhelm [2010] NSWSC 378 (Howie J).  He had in fact completed his submissions on that count and moved to ""the second supply"", in respect of which he proposed that the judge should impose ""a very short custodial sentence"": Tcpt, 30/06/11, p 50(10).  Whether he had completed his submissions in respect of that offence (count 3) is unclear.  However, the trial judge interposed saying:
""What I had in mind was a fixed term of imprisonment which would be partially accumulated on the sentence that I was going to impose for the manslaughter matter.  I propose to impose a non-custodial sentence for what it's worth in relation to the supply for reasons you outlined.  But as I say and subject, of course, to what the Crown has to say to me but it does seem to me that that's the proper approach to this, overwhelmingly my concerns really are the manslaughter charge that should be properly characterised.""
6Counsel for the offender then went on to deal with the manslaughter charge and other matters in relation to the personal circumstances of the offender.
7Prosecuting counsel dealt with the circumstances of the offending globally.  Referring to the ""party packages"" by which an agency supplied both cocaine and women for sexual services to the applicant, and agreeing with the sentencing judge that the package was ""a peculiarly dangerous one"", prosecuting counsel (Ms Cunneen SC) continued, at Tcpt, p 62(35):
""CUNNEEN:  Yes your Honour, but the Crown would say as to the supply, even the first supply, the supply to Ms McIntyre wasn't an isolated incident on the night.
HIS HONOUR:  No.
CUNNEEN:  And so it wasn't perhaps as minor an offence as that described by Justice Howie in Wilhelm.
HIS HONOUR:  I would have thought Wilhelm is probably - the facts in [Wilhelm] are probably more serious than this supply in some ways though because he was supply[ing] drugs to somebody who - my memory of - was fairly naïve in terms of drug use.  And I don't know one is supposed to characterise what happened in any one of the cases where he supplied drugs in this case - other than that the people turned up with the drugs.""
8The exchange drifted off into other matters and it is apparent that counsel, whilst seeking to distinguish Wilhelm, did not make an express submission that a custodial sentence was called for with respect to count 1.  Counsel for the offender did not seek to reply.
9Whether, in these circumstances, it can properly be said that counsel for the offender was deprived, in any practical sense, of an opportunity to make the submissions which he in fact made, is doubtful.  If a short custodial sentence had been imposed in respect of count 1, it is unlikely that he would have been heard to complain.  No doubt the sentence in fact imposed was higher than that he had anticipated, but that of itself does not demonstrate a denial of procedural fairness.  A different conclusion might be reached in circumstances where the prosecutor either proposed or indicated an express acceptance of a nominated sentence: see Baroudi v R [2007] NSWCCA 48; Button v R [2010] NSWCCA 264.  There was no express acceptance by the prosecutor in the present case and indeed she sought to distinguish the precedent relied upon, although she may have let herself be distracted from completing the submission by the course of exchanges with the bench.
10One factor which may tell in favour of a denial of procedural fairness is that the trial judge reserved his decision and expressly excused counsel from attending when judgment was delivered.  The evidence does not indicate that either counsel was present on delivery of judgment.  If the counsel who appeared for the offender on the sentencing hearing had been present, there might have been a further question as to whether he should have raised the complaint of unfairness before final orders were made.  That issue does not arise, but the fact that the trial judge excused counsel may provide some support for the view that he did not then intend to depart from views already expressed.
11If a denial of procedural fairness were to be established, the result would be that the sentencing miscarried and has not yet been properly completed.  Accordingly it would be necessary for this Court, if it did not remit the matter to the sentencing judge, to complete the exercise itself.  That exercise would be at large, and would not be limited to review of a discretionary judgment, as would be the case if the only ground were that the sentence imposed was excessive.
12Despite some misgivings, as the majority of the Court would uphold ground 1, I will deal with the matter on the basis that no valid sentence was imposed on the first count.
Count 1 - determination of sentence13It is convenient to start with some general considerations.  First, count 1 involved a supply of cocaine (a prohibited drug) where both the offender and the recipient were adults and both were consuming the drug.  As noted in Wilhelm, the Court can take judicial notice of the fact that such conduct is common and rarely comes before the courts.  However, consumption of such substances is illegal primarily because of the high risks they carry for the health of the individual, risks which can, as in the present case, materialise in death.
14No doubt cases of supply usually come before the courts when a drug dealer is apprehended, perhaps supplying drugs to an undercover police officer.  However, the offence is not conditional upon the supply being for the purposes of financial reward; nor is it correct to say that the applicant did not expect to benefit from the supply in the present case.  His own use of the drug was designed to heighten sexual arousal and increase disinhibition.  It may properly be inferred that in supplying the drug to the young woman in question he had the same expectation as to its effect on her, from which he hoped to benefit.  It is not necessarily less reprehensible to supply drugs for enhanced sexual satisfaction, than for financial reward.
15The evidence presented to the District Court included a report from a forensic psychiatrist, Dr Bruce Westmore, who examined the applicant on behalf of the New South Wales Medical Board on 13 May 2004.  The applicant reported to Dr Westmore that he had started using cocaine at the end of 2001 or early 2002 (Report, p 2.7 and 4.4).  Dr Westmore reported (p 2):
""He said initially his use of cocaine did not impact on his work although that has occurred over the last nine months.  He attended work irregularly and he was required to cancel some operation lists.  He said he last cancelled a list on 21 February 2004.""
16He appears to have accepted the advice of a psychiatrist he was then seeing for treatment, Dr Stephen Jurd, and on 31 March 2004 wrote to the Medical Board notifying it of his ""recreational intranasal cocaine use"".  His subsequent consultation with Dr Westmore was a consequence of a condition imposed by the Board.  Over the next few years, various conditions were imposed on his continued right to practice, including, for various periods, urinalysis screening and clinical review, supervision and monitoring.  A report from the Medical Board, also before the District Court, stated that the Board had received a letter from a practitioner ""notifying performance concerns"" in November 2008, as a result of which it commenced proceedings under s 66 of the Medical Practice Act 1992 (NSW) (now repealed), the purpose of which was to determine whether conditions should be imposed on his registration, or he should be suspended from practicing medicine, for the purpose of protecting the health or safety of any person.
17Although he had notified his superiors at Nepean Hospital, Penrith, of his problems, he had had difficulties in organising urinalysis in 2004 because he had been reluctant to tell any other medical officer of his drug abuse: Westmore Report, p 3.9.
18Against this background, an assessment must be made of the moral culpability of the applicant at the date of the charge of supply cocaine in February 2009.
19Within two months of seeing Dr Westmore, he relapsed into cocaine use in July 2004, as appeared from the history he gave to Dr Rosalie Wilcox in June 2011, who saw him for the purpose of providing a report for his sentencing hearing.  She described his psychiatric condition as ""cocaine abuse/dependence"", which was explained in the following opinion:
""Mr Nair is a 42 year old single neurosurgeon.  He has a 10 year history of intermittent cocaine use that was predominantly used in an abuse pattern however at times he verged on becoming dependent on cocaine.
He was regarded as having an abuse pattern because he tended to use high doses for a few hours to days followed by much longer periods of abstinence.  However there were also periods where he found it increasingly difficult to resist using cocaine despite the considerable risks associated with its use and this is when he showed signs of becoming dependent.
Mr Nair developed an intense craving to use the drug in sexual situations as it enhanced his desire and led to marked disinhibition.  He had a dual addiction in that he craved the cocaine and the sex.  He was more likely to seek both out when he felt bored or lonely and less likely when he was in a relationship.  In these situations his desire for the drug and the escorts over rode any concerns he may have had about the wrongness of his behaviour.
In November 2008 his use of both cocaine and escorts increased.  He was no longer accountable to his girlfriend as his long term relationship had ended.  The more cocaine he used the more he desired the drug.""
20It will be necessary to return to the use of the terms ""dependence"" and ""addiction"".  It is sufficient to note that no psychiatrist diagnosed him at any relevant time as suffering from a mental illness, which might reduce his moral culpability.  Rather, as the evidence revealed, he indulged over a period of some seven years prior to the offence in count 1 in a course of conduct which involved the consumption and, on occasion, the supply of cocaine.  He did not give evidence that he did not know about the risks involved in the use of the drug; whether he did nor not, as a medical practitioner, such information was readily available to him.  There were risks to the health and life of others (notably his patients), but also to his own health, professional reputation and career and indeed his continuation as a registered medical practitioner.  The evidence given through the psychiatric reports demonstrates an understanding of these factors.  The inevitable conclusion is that he continued in a course of illegal drug use, regardless of the possible consequences, in flagrant disregard of the law.  He was not entitled to any leniency in respect of count 1 on the basis that his offending had not previously been the subject of criminal prosecution.  Nor was his continued drug use to be excused because senior medical officers knew about it.
21As noted by the sentencing judge, the applicant had a poor traffic record.  That did not bear any immediate relevance to the drug supply (or manslaughter) offences, but the fact that he was apprehended driving whilst disqualified and driving an unregistered vehicle on a number of occasions confirms his willingness to disregard the law when it impinged on his personal preferences.  According to Dr Wilcox:
""On questioning Mr Nair did not believe that he deliberately flaunted authority.  He said he did have a moral code in that there were things he would not do, such as he would not steal and would not assault anyone.  He said he had been kind and generous to his patients.  He recognised that his moral boundary had failed in two areas namely his continued use of cocaine and his use of escorts and that these moral boundaries were poorly defined and had been totally focused on pleasure seeking.""
22Because it was a first offence, a lengthy term of imprisonment was inappropriate.  In this case, I agree with Blanch J that an appropriate term of imprisonment would be six months.  However, in my view that sentence should have been imposed by the primary judge and there should have been a degree of accumulation in respect of the other unrelated counts. 
Ground 3: rejection of psychiatric case23The second substantial challenge to the sentences imposed was based on the assertion that the sentencing judge rejected ""the psychiatric case concerning the applicant's cocaine addiction and its connection to the offending and assessment of culpability"": ground 3.  For this purpose, the applicant relied principally upon the report of Dr Wilcox which was tendered as part of his case, although he asserted that the earlier reports of Dr Westmore and Dr Jurd supported, or were at least not inconsistent with, Dr Wilcox' opinions.  Where the prosecution did not seek to challenge such expert evidence, it was submitted that the sentencing judge should have taken it into account and given it appropriate weight, referring to O'Neill-Shaw v R [2010] NSWCCA 42 at [26].
24It is clear that the sentencing judge gave consideration to all three psychiatric reports.  However, he noted that the history Dr Wilcox had obtained from the applicant was not in all respects consistent with the history given to Dr Westmore: at [54]-[57].  The judge noted the diagnosis of ""cocaine abuse/dependence"", but considered it an inadequate explanation for the history set out in the report.  He concluded that even Dr Wilcox did not suggest an addiction, stating that the closest she came to that diagnosis was that ""at times he verged on becoming dependent on cocaine"": at [63].  In the end the judge said he was left with ""no cogent psychiatric explanation for his action"" and concluded that he was ""driven by self-indulgence"".  
25Although the judge did not accept the ""bored and lonely"" explanation, a phrase used by Dr Wilcox as part of the history provided by the applicant, it was not the language of addiction.  Further, Dr Wilcox noted that ""for three months he abstained from the use of cocaine"": Report, p 5.3.  He sought help from a psychologist but she noted that ""trying to get to the psychologist in time added to his stress"".  The opinion set out at [19] above, in the second paragraph of the extract, is curious.  Despite the passive voice, it appears to be an expression of an opinion held by Dr Wilcox.  What precisely was meant by ""an abuse pattern"" was unclear.  The passage may be more a summary of his history than a diagnosis or opinion.  
26In the third paragraph of the quotation at [19] above, the psychiatrist used the language of ""addiction"", but in a sense which suggested that it was more a rhetorical flourish than a professional opinion.  There was no indication anywhere else that he was addicted to sex in a pathological sense.  In another passage, in describing his response to the offences in February and November 2009, she stated that he was likely to have panicked and, ""[i]f his level of intoxication was extreme he may have even been briefly disorientated and confused as a result of a cocaine induced delirium"": p 8.2.  One may search the report and the other material before the Court in vain for any evidence to support such speculation.  A sentencing court would be justified in ignoring such an opinion.
27The next passage in the report reads as follows:
""I believe that the criminal proceedings have had a profound effect on him.  Until he was arrested and charged with murder he managed to minimise the consequences of his actions.  His failure to deal with the incident of February 2009 meant that he continued to work without taking responsibility or being accountable for his actions.  He was in denial with respect to his addiction because he was able to maintain the façade of the successful surgeon and the penalties that were imposed up until this time had little impact on his reputation or lifestyle.""
28At this stage in the report, the term ""addiction"" appears to have been adopted as if the fact were earlier established, which it had not been.  Otherwise the opinion might well be accepted, but it provides nothing to mitigate the objective culpability of the offending.  Read as a whole, Dr Wilcox' report provided a history which was incompatible with any entitlement to leniency and, as the trial judge rightly concluded, provided no acceptable expert opinion demonstrating any motivation other than self indulgence.  Ground 3 should be rejected.
Count 3 - manifest excess29For the reasons given by Blanch J, I would not interfere with the sentence imposed on count 3.  The offence occurred after the applicant's conduct had resulted in two tragic deaths, one of which, he accepts, constituted manslaughter.
30About seven weeks after being released on bail following the second death, and whilst subject to conditions that he not consume illicit drugs or engage the services of an escort or prostitute, he was apprehended indulging in consumption of cocaine with two ""escorts"" to whom he supplied the cocaine at his own premises.  This was a flagrant disregard of the conditions attaching to his liberty, which deserved severe punishment.  The sentencing judge imposed a sentence calculated, before reduction for a plea of guilty, at one-third of the maximum penalty for a single offence, in circumstances where a separate offence was taken into account on a Form 1.  It might be described as conduct which demonstrated a combination of supreme arrogance and lack of insight.  The sentencing judge may have taken a more lenient view, although he referred to ""self indulgence"", as noted above.  Were it not for the need to adjust the starting date of the sentence to allow for the resentencing on count 1, I would have refused leave to appeal against this sentence.
Resentencing31As noted by Blanch J, this Court has remarked on more than one occasion that it is inappropriate to impose a sentence expressed in terms of days and, usually, any period less than a month.  The reason is that it gives a false and misleading impression of the precision in the calculation of sentences.  Neither the starting point nor the discount permit such a level of precision.  As the Court must interfere, it is appropriate to remove the offending elements from each sentence.
32I agree that leave should be granted in respect of each of the sentences.  I would resentence the applicant as follows:
(1) In respect of count 1, quash the sentence imposed in the District Court and sentence the applicant to a fixed term of imprisonment of six months, to date from 9 January 2010.
(2) With respect to count 3, quash the sentence imposed by the District Court and impose a non-parole period of two years and nine months, to date from 9 May 2010 with a balance of term of 11 months.
(3) In respect of count 2, direct that the non-parole period of two years commence on 1 December 2012, with a balance of term of two years six months to commence on 30 November 2014, but otherwise dismiss the appeal against sentence.
The applicant will be eligible for release on parole on 30 November 2014.
33SIMPSON J:  I have read in draft the judgments of both Blanch J and Basten JA.  It is unnecessary to restate the facts in any detail.
34The applicant pleaded guilty to three counts:
(i) supply prohibited drug (cocaine);
(ii) manslaughter;
(iii) supply prohibited drug (cocaine).
35Pursuant to Pt 3 Div 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Procedure Act"") he asked that a further two counts of supply of a prohibited drug (cocaine) identified on a Form 1 be taken into account.  
36The sentences imposed were as follows:
Count 1 (the first count of supply prohibited drug): imprisonment for a fixed term of 2 years and 3 months, commencing on 9 January 2010;
Count 2 (manslaughter): imprisonment for 4 years and 6 months, with a non-parole period of 2 years, commencing on 1 May 2013;
Count 3 (the second count of supply prohibited drug, taking into account the Form 1 offences): imprisonment for 3 years and 9 months, with a non-parole period of 2 years, 9 months and 23 days, commencing on 9 October 2010.
The aggregate sentence is 7 years and 9 months, with a non-parole period of 5 years and 3 months and 22 days.
37The partial accumulation of the sentence imposed in respect of Count 3 (the second to commence) has the effect that the applicant is to serve a period of 9 months imprisonment referable solely to the first count.
38The offences were committed on three entirely separate occasions, over a period of about one year.  The first offence (of supply prohibited drug) was committed on 15 February 2009; the second offence in time (manslaughter) was committed at some time between 19 and 21 November 2009; the third offence (of supply prohibited drug) was committed on 9 January 2010.
39There was a common pattern to the circumstances of all of the offences.  The common pattern was this: the applicant was a practising neurosurgeon.  On the occasion of each offence he arranged for two ""escorts"" (prostitutes) to attend his home.  His arrangement with the agency who supplied the escorts was that it would also supply cocaine.  He then used the drug and supplied it to the escorts.  
40On the first occasion (15 February 2009) one of the escorts died following her consumption of the cocaine provided to her by the applicant.  In respect of this occasion the applicant stood for sentence only in relation to the supply of cocaine.  He was not to be sentenced in relation to the death of this woman.  Her death is relevant only to the applicant's knowledge, on the occasions of the subsequent offences, of the risks associated with the supply of cocaine - something of which the applicant, as a neurosurgeon, ought, in any case, to have been aware.  
41The circumstances giving rise to the count of manslaughter were similar.  On 19 November 2009, the applicant arranged for two escorts to attend his premises.  He consumed cocaine and supplied the escorts with the drug.  One of the escorts (Ms Domingues-Zaupa, aged 22) showed signs of cocaine overdose.  The applicant, who had himself consumed cocaine, gave her a Xanax tablet and water.  Ms Domingues-Zaupa's condition did not improve and she appeared to be choking.  She suffered seizures and went into cardiac arrest.  The applicant did not call an ambulance.  He made some attempts at administering first aid and CPR but these were unsuccessful.  The administration of Xanax was medically inappropriate.  
42The sentencing judge held that the applicant's liability for manslaughter (by gross criminal negligence) arose by reason of his supply of a quantity of cocaine that substantially jeopardised Ms Domingues-Zaupa's physical safety and endangered her life, and in having, by his own consumption of cocaine, diminished his capacity to render assistance.
43In respect of this offence the applicant was arrested on 25 November 2009 and released on bail, on conditions that he not consume illicit drugs and not engage the services of escorts or prostitutes.
44The third offence in time, the second of supply prohibited drug, was committed on 9 January 2010 while the applicant was at liberty on bail.  The circumstances were again similar.  The applicant was present in his apartment with two escorts with whom he had consumed cocaine.  He was in possession of 3.91 grams of cocaine (a traffickable quantity).  It seems that his possession of that drug constituted the offence charged.  The supply of the drug to the two escorts was the subject of the two counts on the Form 1.
45It is unnecessary to recount the applicant's personal circumstances, which have been set out in the judgment of Blanch J.
Ground 1: denial of procedural fairness (Count 1)
46I agree with Blanch J that the appeal on ground 1 ought to be upheld.  I do not share the misgivings of Basten JA.  
47I accept, as Basten JA points out, that the applicant's experienced senior counsel had the opportunity to, and did, make submissions urging a non-custodial penalty in respect of Count 1.  Those submissions were made on 30 June 2011.  The transcript of the proceedings makes it plain that senior counsel had completed his submissions with respect to that count, and had moved to Count 3 (the second offence) before his Honour gave the clear indication (set out in full in the other judgments), that, subject to what the Crown might subsequently say, he proposed to impose a non-custodial penalty for the first offence.  Counsel for the Crown did not explicitly (or, with any clarity, implicitly) oppose that course.  In those circumstances senior counsel for the applicant made no reply.  He was entitled to take the view that none was necessary.
48That, alone, is, in my opinion, sufficient to raise concerns about the unforewarned change of attitude by his Honour when he came to sentence, two months later, on 26 August 2011.  His Honour then declared that each of three offences demanded a significant full-time custodial sentence.  He did not differentiate the first from the second or third.  Of more importance, in my opinion, is what followed that pronouncement: he said:
""Nothing was said, nor could have been, to the contrary.""
49That was undoubtedly correct in relation to the second count (manslaughter), and, to a lesser extent, to the third count (the second of supply).  It was incorrect in two respects in relation to the first count.  Submissions had been put to the contrary of his Honour's proposition, and they were not untenable submissions.  It was therefore incorrect to say than nothing could have been put to the contrary.  Indeed, they had initially been accepted by his Honour.  The incorporation of the first count with the other two counts in this global remark, in my opinion, signifies that his Honour overlooked, and thus failed to take into account, the submissions that had been made.
50That is not precisely the denial of procedural fairness on which senior counsel for the applicant relied on appeal, but it highlights that there was such a denial.
51I therefore accept that ground 1 has been made out and the applicant must be re-sentenced on that count.
52That leaves a question as to what alternative sentence ought to be imposed.  It is necessary to look at this offence in isolation from the subsequent offences.  It is not possible to say with confidence what sentence would have been imposed had the applicant stood for sentence in respect of this offence at any time before November 2009.  However, there is available an argument, as Blanch J points out, that, if the applicant had been dealt with for that offence alone, he may well have had the benefit of some form of non-custodial sentence, such as a community service order (see s 8 of the Sentencing Procedure Act), or an intensive correction order (see s 7 of the Sentencing Procedure Act).  Relevant to that assessment is the high degree of likelihood that that offence alone would have resulted in significant extra-curial punishment by way of disciplinary proceedings within the medical profession.  
53Both Blanch J and Basten JA propose a sentence of imprisonment of 6 months.  The difference between their Honours is whether that sentence should be served wholly concurrently with the subsequent sentence, or made partially cumulative.
54A wholly concurrent sentence, as proposed by Blanch J, has the appearance of marking the Court's condemnation of the applicant's behaviour, while, in reality, imposing no effective punishment.  That is an unfortunate and inevitable consequence of the water that has flowed under the bridge since the commission of that offence.
55Accordingly, although ordinarily that offence would have called for some discrete punishment, I agree with Blanch J that the sentence should now be served wholly concurrently with the sentence imposed in respect of the third count.
Ground 2: manifest excess (Count 3)
56Ground 2 concerns the sentence imposed in respect of the third count, the second of supply.  The sentence imposed (when adjusted to delete the unnecessary, confusing, and cumbersome calculation in months and days) is a total of 3 years and 9 months, with a non-parole period of 2 years and (almost) 10 months (or 34 months) with a balance of term of 11 months.  
57Like Blanch J, I would reject as irrelevant the argument that this offence could have been dealt with summarily in the Local Court.  It was the second offence of its kind, it was committed while the applicant was on bail for a serious offence that involved the supply of drugs and a drug related death, and subject to a specific condition concerning the consumption of illicit drugs, and it was to be dealt with in conjunction with the far more serious offence of manslaughter.  It is wholly unrealistic to suggest that it could properly have been dealt with in the Local Court.
58When the reduction allowed in recognition of the applicant's plea of guilty is taken into account, the starting point was a sentence of 5 years.  The offence involved supply of a relatively small quantity drugs to a willing and informed recipient, who was present for what were essentially commercial purposes.  
59A starting point of 5 years, when those circumstances are considered, is high.  However, the circumstances that made this offence unsuitable to be dealt with in the Local Court are also relevant to the assessment of its objective gravity.  It was a second offence of its kind, the first having been committed in circumstances in which the supply of drugs resulted in the death of the recipient.  The applicant could have been in no doubt of the potential consequences of his conduct in supplying drugs.  The offence was committed in the wake of a second episode in which the applicant had supplied the same drug to two escorts, which resulted in the death of one of them, ie a second drug related death.  It was committed while he was on bail for that offence, and subject to an explicit condition concerning consumption of drugs.  And the sentence had to take into account the two Form 1 offences.
60Sentencing for this offence called for a very large component of personal deterrence, as well as general deterrence.
61What has troubled me is the proportionality of this sentence, especially the non-parole period, to the sentence imposed in respect of the manslaughter charge.  The respective head sentences are 4 years and 6 months (manslaughter) and 3 years and 9 months (supply).  But the non-parole periods are 2 years (manslaughter) and 2 years and (almost) 10 months (supply).  Against maximum sentences of 25 years and 15 years respectively, that appears to me to be anomalous.  However, the anomaly was not raised on appeal, and the Crown has not appealed against the manslaughter sentence.  In all of the circumstances, the Count 3 sentence was warranted.
62I agree that this ground has not been made out.
Ground 3: asserted rejection of the applicant's ""psychiatric case""
63Ground 3 concerns the treatment of what is called the applicant's ""psychiatric case"".  I agree, for the reasons given by Basten JA and Blanch J that this ground should be rejected.  
64I agree with the observations of Basten JA at [31] of his judgment, concerning the calculation of sentences in months and days, and would prefer that this Court make orders that adjusted and re-calculated these sentences.  However, in the result, I agree with the orders proposed by Blanch J. 
65BLANCH J:  The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed in the Sydney District Court on 26 August 2011.  He entered pleas of guilty to three offences as follows:
(1) Supply prohibited drug (cocaine) on 15 February 2009 contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 which carries a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment.  He was sentenced to a fixed term of 2 years and 3 months to date from 9 January 2010.
(2) Manslaughter of Suellen Domingues-Zaupa between 19 and 21 November 2009 contrary to s 18(1)(b) Crimes Act 1900 which carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment.  He was sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years to date from 1 May 2013 and expire on 30 April 2015 with a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months.
(3) Supply prohibited drug (cocaine) on 9 January 2010 contrary to s 25(1) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act which has a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment.  He asked that two other charges of supply cocaine be taken into account on a Form 1.  He was sentenced to 2 years, 9 months and 23 days to date from 9 October 2010 and expire on 31 July 2013 with a balance of term of 11 months and 8 days.
The total effective head sentence was 7 years, 9 months and 21 days.  The non-parole period was 5 years, 3 months and 21 days.
FACTS
66The applicant was a neurosurgeon practising in western Sydney at the relevant time.
Offence 1
67On 14 February 2009 he engaged two female escorts to attend his premises.  He offered them cocaine but they declined and left after an hour.  Shortly after, two other escorts came to his premises knowing they would be ""partying"" with the applicant.  Over approximately eight to ten hours he engaged in various sexual acts with the two women and provided them with large quantities of cocaine and he used cocaine himself.  At about 11.00am on 15 February another escort, Victoria McIntyre, attended the premises and was offered a ""line"" of cocaine by the applicant.  Shortly after, the other two escorts left the premises to buy sex toys and fill a prescription.  When they returned to the outside of the premises, they spoke to the applicant over the intercom and he asked them to return a short time later.  He called ""000"" and reported that Victoria McIntyre had suffered a fit and an ambulance was called.  He administered first aid until the ambulance came at which time he told the ambulance officer ""we were on the bed together and she had a seizure..."".  Victoria McIntyre died in hospital twelve hours later.
Offence 2
68On 19 November 2009 the applicant arranged for two escorts to come to his premises and one of these escorts was the victim Suellen Domingues-Zaupa.  The victim arrived at 4.30pm after the other escort and the three persons engaged in sexual acts and consumed a large quantity of cocaine provided by the applicant.  They were all affected by the cocaine and it appears the victim began to have difficulty breathing and her body was shaking with convulsions.  The applicant placed a Xanax tablet into her mouth with some water but she became increasingly unwell and went into cardiac arrest.  He did not call an ambulance but he made attempts to administer first aid.  The applicant was seen to leave the premises at about 5.45am the next morning in company with a number of escorts and was seen to be quite affected by the drugs.  When he did not come to work, his colleagues alerted the police who went to his premises and found the body of the deceased in his bedroom.  The cause of death was later determined to be cocaine toxicity. Medical expert evidence was that the treatment administered by the applicant was inadequate, that the administration of Xanax was not appropriate and he should have called an ambulance.  The agreed statement of facts was that the applicant's legal liability for manslaughter was on the basis that he was grossly negligent.   On 25 November 2009 he was charged with supplying cocaine and granted bail.  On 4 February 2010 he was charged with murder and on 22 December 2010 the prosecution accepted his plea of guilty to manslaughter.
Offence 3
69On 9 January 2010 while he was still on bail for the offence of supplying cocaine, police attended his premises where they discovered him with two escorts to whom he had supplied cocaine (this represents the two offences on the Form 1).  Police located 3.91g of cocaine at the premises, being a traffickable quantity.  The sentencing judge found the applicant engaged the various escorts through an agency and that he paid for a ""party package"" which included the supply of cocaine and the escorts. 
Ground 1:(a)  There was a denial of procedural fairness in the imposition of a custodial sentence on count 1.(b)  The sentence imposed on count 1 is manifestly excessive. 
70During the course of the proceedings on sentence, there was a discussion between the sentencing judge and senior counsel for the applicant about the appropriate sentence in respect of Count 1 and a discussion of the sentence imposed in R v Wilhelm [2010] NSWSC 378, where the offender supplied drugs to Diane Brimble who died as a result and where the sentencing judge found the offence to be one of social supply and chose in that case to justify a conviction but with no further penalty.  Having discussed that case with counsel, his Honour then said in relation to the first count on the indictment:
""I propose to impose a non-custodial sentence for what it's worth in relation to the supply for reasons you outlined.  But as I say and subject, of course, to what the Crown has to say to me but it does seem to me that that's the proper approach to this, overwhelmingly my concerns really are the manslaughter charge that should be properly characterised.""
71Having so informed counsel, that issue was not further discussed during the course of the hearing which took place on 30 June 2011.  When the judge came to impose sentence on 26 August 2011, he said:
""Each of the offences is serious and each demand a significant full time custodial sentence.  Nothing was said, nor could have been, to the contrary.""
72It is accepted by the Crown that this did deny procedural fairness to the applicant and the structure of the sentence resulted in the sentence for this offence adding 9 months to the overall period of imprisonment and, in particular, adding 9 months to the non-parole period.
73The Crown, however, argues that this does not mean the sentence should be disturbed on appeal and submits that the offence in Count 1 of supply was not an isolated incident and that the applicant had been consuming cocaine from at least 2004 when he self-reported that fact to the Medical Board.
74The first charge must be considered bearing in mind the offence was in February 2009 whereas the subsequent offences were in November 2009 and January 2010.  It is also true that the supply in this case was a social supply and was not done for profit.  On the findings of the sentencing judge, the cocaine was supplied to him by the escort agency for the purpose of mutual use by the applicant and the escorts.  
75Had this matter been dealt with in isolation, it clearly would have given rise to an argument as to whether or not a full-time prison sentence was necessary.  Obviously the trial judge had this in mind at the time of hearing submissions on sentence.  If the matter had come before a court for sentence some time between February 2009 when the offence was committed and before the subsequent offences in November 2009 and January 2010, the applicant would have come before the court as a person of good character who had an excellent reputation as a neurosurgeon and who had a problem with drugs.  He would have faced the difficulty that as a doctor he should have been aware of both the illegality and the danger in the use of cocaine, which was demonstrated in this case by the fact one of the escorts became so affected she had to lie down due to the effects of the cocaine.  Weighing those competing factors, it is probable that a full time custodial sentence would not have been passed and some form of community service order or intensive corrections order would have been imposed. 
76It is properly accepted by the Crown the applicant was denied procedural fairness and because of that it is necessary for this Court to re-sentence. The sentence imposed should be set aside and another sentence imposed.  In my view, because at this stage it is not possible to impose a community service order or intensive corrections order, there should be a prison sentence imposed in order to reflect the criminality involved in the offence but it should be a fixed term of 6 months to be concurrent with the other sentences.
Ground 2:  The sentence imposed on Count 3 is manifestly excessive
77It is recognised by the applicant that this count is more serious since it was committed on conditional bail and that there are two matters on the Form 1.  That concession is entirely justifiable, bearing in mind he was at that stage on bail for the previous supply of cocaine and the bail contained conditions he was not to consume or supply cocaine or engage prostitutes.  It is argued that the offence involved 3.91g of cocaine which was deemed to be for the purpose of supply as it was more than the traffickable quantity of 3g of cocaine and it is pointed out that as with the first offence it was intended for social use and the applicant intended using some of it himself.  The argument is also advanced it is a matter that could have been dealt with in a summary manner where a magistrate's jurisdiction would have been limited to 2 years.
78This Court has stressed on a number of occasions that where Form 1 offences are taken into account, it can be expected that it will result in a longer sentence and that in a case such as this, the Form 1 offences indicate it was not an isolated instance - see for example Attorney General's Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No. 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 and Dionys v R [2011] NSWCCA 272.  In this case the fact that the offence was not isolated is not only apparent from the Form 1 offences, but also from the offences committed in February 2009 and November 2009.
79Because of those considerations, in my view it cannot be said that this sentence was excessive and for those same reasons, it was an offence which ought not, in fact, have been dealt with in a summary manner.  Because of that, the fact the case could have been dealt with in the Local Court is merely a theoretical possibility - see Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 - and does not justify a reduction in the penalty. 
Ground 3:  His Honour erred in rejecting the psychiatric case concerning the applicant's cocaine addiction and its connection to the offending and assessment of culpability.
80In the report of Dr Wilcox tendered by the defence it was said the applicant ""... developed an intense craving to use the drug in sexual situations as it enhanced his desire and led to a marked disinhibition.  He had both a dual addiction in that he craved the cocaine and the sex.""  She noted that he sought cocaine and sex when he felt bored and lonely and said he ""... would have been unable to react to a medical emergency in a calm and appropriate manner.  He is more likely to have panicked and to have acted in a disorganised manner.  If his level of intoxication was extreme he may have even been briefly disorientated and confused as a result of a cocaine induced delirium.""
81A report by Dr Westmore was tendered by the Crown and Dr Westmore described the applicant as having a ""Cocaine Abuse/Dependence"" which was moderate to severe and also identified social isolation as a stressor.
82The sentencing judge having quoted from Dr Wilcox's report said: 
""61. The doctor does not offer a diagnosis beyond: ""Cocaine Abuse/Dependence"".  
62. To my mind that is inadequate and hardly explains not only why this man did what he did but why he persisted in identical behaviour since released from the Northside Clinic that he did it on bail. 
63.  This was not mere addiction to cocaine.  Even Dr Wilcox does not suggest an addiction.  The closest she gets is:-
... at times he verged on becoming dependent on cocaine.
64.  Nor am I persuaded by the ""bored or lonely"" thesis.
65.  In the end I am left with no cogent psychiatric explanation for his action.  I conclude that he was driven by self-indulgence.""
83These statements by his Honour have led to the submission that the judge rejected wholly the applicant's psychiatric case.  On the other hand the judge knew and stated that the report of Dr Wilcox offered a diagnosis of ""Cocaine Abuse/Dependence"" and that characterisation of Dr Wilcox's report appears to be appropriate.  Dr Wilcox's report noted that he had a ""10 year history of intermittent cocaine use that was predominantly used in an abuse pattern however at times he verged on becoming dependent on cocaine.""  She indicated that he went through cycles of self-medication and that probably at the time of the commission of the offences in February 2009 and November 2009 he was in such a cycle.  She said:  ""On both occasions he was markedly intoxicated due to having consumed large amounts of cocaine throughout the night and on both occasions he had virtually no sleep.""
84I do not believe it can be said the judge rejected the applicant's psychiatric case.  He did not quote all the relevant sections of Dr Wilcox's report but he was clearly aware of the content of the report and of the diagnosis of ""Cocaine Abuse/Dependence"".
85The further question is raised in this case as to what the real impact of this evidence on the sentence would be.  In R v Henry [1999] 46 NSWLR 346 at [197]-[198], Spigelman CJ said:
""In my opinion drug addicts who commit crime should not be added to the list of victims.  Their degree of moral culpability will vary, just as it varies for individuals who are not affected by addiction.  There are a number of aspects of the relationship between drug addiction and crime which indicate that moral choices are made.
First is the original decision to experiment with drugs which, in the usual case, is a completely free choice.  The addictive quality of drugs, together with the anti-social behaviour which so commonly results from addiction, is so widely known that persons who choose a course of addiction must be treated as choosing its consequences.""
86At [257] Wood CJ at CL said:
""The comparison is also imperfect in so far as it overlooks the original element of choice every person has, initially whether or not to experiment with drugs, and thereafter to continue with their use.  Even if some persons have a genetic predisposition or vulnerability to addiction, they are not, in my view, entitled to claim any favours in that regard.  The addictive quality of drugs and the potential of a slide into a degraded or criminal lifestyle are so well known as to invite a free choice.   Those who choose to use drugs must, in my view, accept the consequences.""
87Those statements of principle have been applied consistently in this Court:  see for example, R v SY [2003] NSWCCA 291 and Bichar v R [2006] NSWCCA 1.
88The substance of the complaint made by the applicant is that ""his culpability for the offence should be reduced as a result"" of the medical evidence.  This is apparently put on the basis it is analogous to reducing the culpability of a mentally ill person.  In so far as dependence or even addiction to drugs is concerned, unless a supervening mental illness is demonstrated, I would reject this proposition for the reasons given in the cases cited.  It is also argued his judgment was clouded as a result of the ingestion of drugs and in consequence his culpability is less but I do not believe that warrants any interference in this sentence. 
89This Court must be satisfied pursuant to s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 that ""some other sentence whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed.""  
90The circumstances for the offence of manslaughter vary enormously and in the result sentences vary as well.  Compared to a maximum penalty of 25 years, a sentence of 4½ years can be seen as one towards the lower end of the scale.  This was a case where although the applicant had extremely compelling subjective circumstances, he had committed repeat offences involving the supply of cocaine and where, as a medical practitioner, he should have been aware of the dangers of supplying large doses of cocaine to the escorts he had hired.  It is a situation where a sentence of some significance must be passed in order to reflect the principles of general deterrence and in my view, in this case no lesser sentence would be warranted. 
91For the foregoing reasons, I propose that the sentences on Counts 2 and 3 be confirmed but that they date from 9 January 2010, the date on which the sentence on the first count commences.  That means in rounded out terms a sentence of approximately 7½ years with a non-parole period of 4½ years.  I propose not interfering with the precise terms of the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge but I express my concurrence with many earlier statements of the Court of Criminal Appeal that it is undesirable for judges to express sentences in terms of days and sentences in these sorts of cases should be expressed in terms of years and months. 
92A further problem emerges in this case because the sentencing judge expressed a view that he did not find special circumstances except to preserve the ratio between the effective head sentence and the effective non-parole period.  However, the effective head sentence imposed was one of 7 years, 9 months and 21 days or 93 months and 21 days and the non-parole period was 5 years, 3 months and 21 days or 63 months and 21 days.  This had the effect of making the non-parole period approximately 68% of the head sentence as opposed to the statutory ratio of 75%.  In other words, in spite of his stated intention, the judge did vary the statutory ratio.  The structure of the sentence I would propose involves a head sentence of 7½ years with a non-parole period of 4½ years.  In rounded figures that is equivalent to a ratio of approximately 60%.  There are reasons in this case to vary the statutory ratio to justify that approach, they being the fact this is his first term of imprisonment and he has had a long-standing drug problem which will require his ongoing supervision when released from custody.
93I propose the following orders:
(1) Grant leave to appeal.
(2) Allow the appeal in respect of Count 1 and quash the sentence imposed in the District Court and sentence the applicant to a fixed term of imprisonment of 6 months to date from 9 January 2010.
(3) I would dismiss the appeal against the sentence imposed in respect of the third count of supply prohibited drug and confirm the sentence but the sentence of 2 years, 9 months and 23 days should date from 9 January 2010 with a balance of term of 11 months and 8 days.
(4) I would dismiss the appeal against the sentence on the second count of manslaughter and confirm the sentence of 2 years with a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months but that sentence should commence on 1 August 2012.  He would be eligible for release to parole on 31 July 2014.

2706890,R v Higgins [2013] NSWDC 322,"Judgment


1This is a case which involves a collapsing marriage where the husband and the wife were also involved in running a business. One of the parties, the wife, had a concern that her husband had been using drugs and had mental health problems and was behaving uncharacteristically. I do not know whether that apprehension was correct or not. 

2The husband and the wife became engaged in a series of arguments and clashes with each other. The wife reported the series of clashes to the police and claimed that she was assaulted. She obtained an apprehended domestic violence order, but in addition, the police charged the husband with three crimes which were common assault and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. 

3The case went before the Local Court where her Honour, Magistrate Barry, found that the three offences were proved to her satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt and she convicted the husband of the three offences.

4The husband has appealed against those convictions and the hearing of the appeal was conducted before me and it is for me. It is for me to resolve the case. I should say something at the outset about the principles which I apply in determining the appeal. The case is governed by the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW). Section 18 of that Act provides that an ""appeal against convictions is to be by way of re-hearing on the basis of evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings"". There is provision for fresh evidence, which is not relevant in this case. 

5The appellant husband is Mr Joshua Higgins. The respondent to the appeal is the Director of Public Prosecutions, who took over the case from the police. Ms L Graham, who appeared on the appeal for the DPP, took me to the authorities about the conduct of these appeals. Her submissions have had the effect of altering the way that I have been conducting appeals such as this. I have been placing too little weight on the reasons given by the magistrate at first instance. Ms Graham has reminded me of what the Court of Criminal Appeal said in Charara v R [2006] NSWCCA 244; 164 A Crim R 39 in the judgment of the then Mason P with whom David Kirby and Hoeben JJ, as his Honour then was, agreed. The President observed that the authors of a particular text expressed the view that a District Court Judge ""may not have regard"" to the reasons of the magistrate from whom a conviction appeal is being brought. The learned President observed that the point had not been argued, but offered some observations. His Honour observed at [23] -

""The District Court is impliedly directed to consider the reasons because the stated appellate function could not properly take place without reference to them.""

His Honour went on in the following paragraph to note that the ""Local Court reasons will doubtless include an explanation why the conviction was entered at first instance, including an assessment of the credibility issues touching any factual dispute. Without reference to the reasons the District Court would be driven to speculation or deciding the issue entirely afresh. Neither such course would be consonant with the statutory scheme. In civil appeals, the court of appeal is not entitled to ignore the reasons in which findings based on credibility are to be found.... There is no basis in principle for a different approach in the criminal law.""

6I make two preliminary observations before considering the three convictions which are appealed against. The first observation is this. There is a distinction between the standard of proof required to find a person guilty of an offence and the standard of proof required for a court to issue an apprehended domestic violence order. The standard required before a person can be convicted is the usual standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt. I am informed that the standard required for the issue of an apprehended domestic violence order is on the balance of probabilities. That is a significant distinction. 

7The second observation I make concerns the finding which her Honour Magistrate Barry made about the wife who gave evidence before her Honour in the proceedings. Her Honour expressed the view ""that the evidence of the victim is highly credible. She was an impressive and compelling witness. She was clearly a reluctant witness."" Her Honour then ""found the complainant to be a compelling and truthful witness."" It is important that I take into account that view and finding by her Honour because her Honour had the advantage of seeing the witness and hearing her evidence and an appreciation of the atmosphere of the trial. 

8I turn now to consider the three offences which her Honour found Mr Higgins guilty of. It is convenient to consider the offence which was last in time first. That is said to have taken place on 19 November 2011. Ms Higgins said that there was an argument at their home. She walked outside and her husband ""got me from behind"". She had the feeling that she had ""been pulled back"" and that he ""pulled down and he started - like, started dragging me across the front yard and I ended up just letting go"". She said that she immediately drove to the police station after that event. She presented at the police station, she said, with ""cuts on my hands"" and she also had ""cuts all over the back of my shoulder"". She apparently went to the doctor two days later. The ground outside over which she said she had been dragged contained wood chips. 

9Mr Higgins' legal representative called a witness in Mr Higgins' case, who gave evidence about that incident. That witness was Mr Higgins' mother, Ms Elizabeth Bennett. She said that she was at the home when the events described by Ms Higgins were said to have occurred. She said that she saw that Ms Higgins ""fell backwards onto the wood chip"" and that she fell fairly hard. She was then asked whether she thought it was an accident and she said ""Yes"". It was put to her by the police prosecutor that rather than a mutual struggle (or something lesser than that) Mr Higgins pulled Ms Higgins from behind, causing her to fall down. Ms Bennett answered clearly ""No he didn't"". She also denied that her son ""then dragged her some way across the lawn or the yard"". She said that she did not see any injuries on Ms Higgins.

10Before I could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that that offence is proved, I have to be sure that there is no reasonable possibility that the account given by Ms Bennett could be true. That is the sort of direction I give to a jury. Ms Bennett was cross-examined, but from my reading, was not unsettled at all in the cross-examination. Indeed, Ms Higgins, perhaps understandably, acknowledged in cross-examination that she was a ""good lady"", referring to her in general terms. I cannot see any particular reason for rejecting the account given by Ms Bennett. The learned Magistrate said that she did ""not accept her evidence"". Her Honour went on to say that Ms Higgins' evidence in relation to the charge was corroborated by photographs taken by the police. However, those photographs were taken some five days later. As I say, I do not have a reason for rejecting Ms Bennett's account which must raise a reasonable doubt about the account given by Ms Higgins. I do regard the photographs as persuasive, but note that they were taken some five days later. My reasonable doubt is increased by the fact that Ms Higgins attended the police station in what, on her account, was a distressed and dishevelled state, bleeding and with wood chips, but there was no evidence called in the prosecution case from the police about any observations consistent with that, nor were there any photographs. I also take into account the direction which I would give a jury, that in a case such as this, where it is one word against another, I must be very certain about the evidence of the complainant. In addition, I take into account that Mr Higgins was regarded by a witness as a man of good character who would not over-react in a stressful situation. 

11For those reasons, despite the finding of her Honour that Ms Higgins was a very impressive witness, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the count has been proved. I immediately add that that is not the same as a finding that I reject Ms Higgins' account. I have given weight to the finding made by the Magistrate. I have no doubt that Ms Higgins was a very impressive witness. But I have come to that conclusion because of the very high standard required of the criminal law before someone can be found guilty of a criminal offence and for the reasons that I have given, I entertain a reasonable doubt about whether or not that offence occurred. 

12I turn now to evidence about the first offence which is said to have occurred on 11 October 2011. That is the first time that there was some violence between the parties. There was some pushing and, in addition, Ms Higgins said that Mr Higgins ""tried to strangle me"". She went on to say that he ""put his hands across, around my throat and it was, like, holding onto my throat while I'm trying to get away from him"". She ended up hiding in the bathroom and she heard her husband leave and eventually her mother arrived. Ms Higgins evidently had some photographs taken after that incident. She referred to those photographs at page 13 of her evidence on 15 May 2012, but they were not produced in court. 

13To my mind, I must also entertain a reasonable doubt about that count. There are two specific reasons. One is that the photographs said to have been taken by or on behalf of Ms Higgins were not produced. The second is that the mother, who would have been, it seems to me, in a position to observe her daughter's distress and any marks the result of the attempted strangling, was not called to give evidence. These omissions are matters of concern when a judicial officer needs to make a finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt. In addition, I take into account my own finding made in relation to the third and last count that there was a doubt about Ms Higgins' evidence caused by the evidence of Ms Bennett. I also take into account in relation to that charge evidence of Mr Higgins' good character and the fact that Ms Higgins was an essential witness for the prosecution. 

14I turn finally to the second incident which is said to have occurred on 16 November 2011 when Ms Higgins said that her husband threw the phone at her and threatened her. The nature of the threat was that he said that he was looking for a knife to kill her. He later on grabbed her. Because I have doubts about the evidence on the last count and because of Mr Higgins' good character and the fact that I must be very clearly satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about the evidence of Ms Higgins, I also entertain a doubt about that count. 

15I was assisted by both written and oral submissions by Ms L Graham and by Mr L W Nicholls of counsel, who appeared for the appellant, Mr Higgins. Ms Graham pointed out that realistically, in a case such as this involving a domestic dispute with alleged physical violence, there is a limit on the amount of evidence that might be called. I think she is right about that and to treat cases which are relatively less serious than other cases with the same degree of attention which may be required for a far more serious case, would lead to considerable hold-up in the administration of justice. I do not criticise the procedures involved. Nevertheless, as I observed at the beginning of this judgment, there are two standards involved. The standard required for the issue of an apprehended domestic violence order is lower. If somebody is charged with criminal offences, then the standard remains beyond reasonable doubt. It is very high and is sometimes described as the highest standard known to the law. 

16For the reasons that I have given, I entertain a reasonable doubt about the guilt of Mr Higgins of all three charges and I propose to allow his appeal and I acquit him. 

17The formal order which I make is this. Under s 20(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, I determine these appeals against convictions by setting aside the three convictions. 

HIS HONOUR: Thank you Mr Nicholls. Thank you Ms Graham. Thank you both again and thank you Ms Graham for shifting my thinking on that legal issue. Appreciated. Thanks for your help, Mr Nicholls.

		11 July 2014",2013-04-18 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2706891,Morgan v Regina (No 2) [2013] NSWCCA 80,"Judgment
1BEAZLEY P:  The application before the Court is for an extension of time in which to file an appeal against the applicant's conviction on two counts on an indictment following a jury trial in the District Court.  The Crown has contended that the Court has no jurisdiction to hear the application or any appeal should the application be successful in circumstances where the applicant, Raymond George Morgan, had already appealed against the convictions and the Court had determined that appeal.  The applicant contends that the Court has jurisdiction because he did not, in his first appeal, appeal against his conviction in respect of counts 5 and 6.  Alternatively, he contended that he abandoned his appeal in respect of his conviction on those counts and the Court has jurisdiction to go behind that abandonment.  
2The background to the application is as follows. 
3On 26 June 2009, the applicant was found guilty of the following counts on an indictment filed in the District Court on 20 May 2009:
Count 2:  receiving a stolen motor vehicle;
Count 3:  robbery in company at a hotel in Willoughby;
Count 4:  robbery in company at a hotel in Drummoyne;
Count 5:  possessing $4,650 in cash, the proceeds of crime;  and
Count 6:  possessing $25,000 in cash, the proceeds of crime.
4A verdict of not guilty was returned on count 1 in the indictment, being a charge of stealing a motor vehicle.  That count had been brought alternatively to count 2.  Having found the applicant guilty on count 2, the verdict of not guilty on count 1 followed.  
5The applicant, by notice to appeal filed on 22 October 2010 (the original appeal), appealed against all counts of which he had been convicted.  In his notice of grounds of appeal filed 22 October 2010, the applicant relied upon the following five grounds of appeal:
""Ground [o]ne:  the learned trial judge erred in admitting the evidence of the witness Professor Maciej Henneberg to the effect that:
(a)  the appellant was similar in appearance to one of the robbers;
(b)  that the appellant was identical in appearance to one of the robbers:
(c)  statistical evidence about the proportion of the population who would fit into ... Professor Henneberg's description of the 'person of interest'.  
Ground two:  his Honour erred in failing to give any or any adequate reasons for admitting the opinion evidence of Professor Henneberg.
Ground three:  his Honour erred in failing to direct the jury ... that in order to convict the appellant of receiving a stolen motor vehicle (count two) the jury would have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant did not steal the motor vehicle (count one).  
Ground four:  the verdict on count two was unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.
Ground five:  the jury's verdicts on counts 3 and 4 were unreasonable and inconsistent with the evidence.""
6The notice of grounds of appeal, on their terms, were not directed to the convictions on counts 5 and 6.  Nor did the applicant's written submissions in support of his appeal, filed 4 February 2011, refer to counts 5 and 6.  
7The Crown's written submissions, in response to ground 5 of the notice of appeal, noted:  
""... that although the evidence to establish count 6 (the location of $25,000 in cash bundled in the same way as that taken from the Willoughby Hotel) supports the conviction on count 3, no challenge is made by the applicant to the verdict on count 6.""
The Crown did not direct any remarks to count 5.  
8At the conclusion of his oral submissions on the appeal, not having addressed any submission to counts 5 and 6, senior counsel for the applicant was asked about those counts in the following exchange:
""HIDDEN J:  Mr Stratton, the remaining two counts are not the subject of any appeal?
STRATTON:  No.  That's the money laundering counts, no.
HIDDEN J:  The appellant is serving a sentence in respect of those along with the other sentences at present?
STRATTON:  Yes, your Honour.""  
Nothing further was raised in relation to these counts.
9The orders made by the Court on the original appeal:  Morgan v R [2011] NSWCCA 257, were as follows:
""Appeal allowed in part. Conviction on count 2 quashed, verdict of acquittal entered. Convictions on counts 3 and 4 quashed, (by majority) new trial ordered.""
10The appeal was allowed in part, as the Court rejected ground 5 of the grounds of appeal.  Following the Court's determination of the appeal, the Director of Public Prosecutions directed that there be no further proceedings in relation to counts 3 and 4.  The sentences imposed by the trial judge in respect of counts 5 and 6 expired on 3 December 2010 and 3 December 2011 respectively and the applicant served the sentence in full.
11The applicant now seeks to appeal against his convictions on counts 5 and 6.  Alternatively, he contends that he had abandoned his appeal in relation to counts 5 and 6 and that the circumstances were such that, the Court, in the exercise of its discretion, should permit the applicant to withdraw that abandonment and now proceed to hear and determine the appeal against his convictions on those two counts.  
12The Crown contended that the Court has no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against counts 5 and 6, as the applicant's original appeal was against all counts of which he was convicted, including counts 5 and 6, and that appeal was determined by the orders of the Court made on 1 December 2011.  As the Court's orders were entered on the Court's computerised record system on 8 December 2011 and no application was made to set aside those orders within the 14 day time period prescribed by the Criminal Appeal Rules, r 50C, the Court's orders were final and no extension of time is permitted by the Rules:  r 50C(4).  
13According to this submission, therefore, the original appeal, which included counts 5 and 6, could not be the subject of a further appellate determination.  The Crown also submitted, in support of its primary contention that the applicant had already appealed against counts 5 and 6, that upon the proper construction of the statutory right of appeal contained in the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 5(1), one appeal only is maintainable from an indictment containing multiple counts (whether such appeal is brought as of right or pursuant to leave).  
Relevant legislation
14An appeal against conviction may be brought pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act, s 5(1).  That section provides:
""5 Right of appeal in criminal cases
(1) A person convicted on indictment may appeal under this Act to the court: 
(a) against the person's conviction on any ground which involves a question of law alone, and(b) with the leave of the court, or upon the certificate of the judge of the court of trial that it is a fit case for appeal against the person's conviction on any ground of appeal which involves a question of fact alone, or question of mixed law and fact, or any other ground which appears to the court to be a sufficient ground of appeal ...(c) ...""
15The Criminal Appeal Act, s 6 governs the powers of the Court in respect of any appeal under s 5.  Relevantly, it provides as follows:
""6  Determination of appeals in ordinary cases
(1) The court on any appeal under section 5 (1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal; provided that the court may, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that the point or points raised by the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.""
16The Criminal Appeal Rules govern the procedural requirements of an appeal and also provide for the entry of orders made by the Court on the determination of an appeal, as well as for the consequences of entry of such orders.  In addition, the Rules specify various powers of the Court to set aside or vary orders.  
17Rules 23C-24 specify the requirements for filing a notice of appeal, relevantly, as follows:
""23C Documents to accompany notice of appeal or notice of application for leave to appeal
A notice of appeal against conviction, or a notice of application for leave to appeal against sentence, may not be filed, except with the leave of the Court or the Registrar, unless it is accompanied by the following: 
(a) a statement of the grounds for appeal,(b) written submissions in support of the appeal,(c) a certificate by or on behalf of the appellant that the following are available from the proper officer of the Court of Trial: 
(i) the transcript of the proceedings in the Court of Trial (including the transcript of the summing-up to the jury in the case of an appeal against conviction, and the transcript of the remarks on sentence in the case of an appeal against sentence),(ii) the exhibits in the Court of Trial,
(d) a statement nominating the solicitor and counsel acting for the appellant.
23D Effect of incomplete notice of appeal or leave to appeal
A notice of appeal against conviction, or a notice of application for leave to appeal against sentence, that is not accompanied by all the documents listed in rule 23C has effect as a notice of intention to appeal, or a notice of intention to apply for leave to appeal, as the case may be.
...
24 Requirement to complete form of notice of appeal etc
(1) Every person sending the following notices is to answer the questions and comply with the requirements set out in the relevant forms for the notices: 
(a) notice of intention to appeal,(b) notice of intention to apply for leave to appeal,(c) notice of appeal,(d) notice of application for leave to appeal,(e) notice of an appeal under section 5F (3) of the Act.
(2) The answers to the questions in such forms are taken to be applications to the Court in respect of the matters referred to in the forms.""  (emphasis added)
18Rule 25A(1) provides that where an appellant intends to rely upon grounds of appeal not stated in the notice of appeal, the appellant is to send notice of additional grounds to the Registrar within 28 days after giving notice of the appeal or application for leave to appeal.  The time specified in subrule (1) may be extended by the Court at any time:  see subrule (2).  
19Rule 27 deals with the abandonment of an appeal and is in the following terms: 
""27 Abandonment of appeal
An appellant who has given notice of appeal, or of any application, may abandon such appeal or application by forwarding a notice of abandonment (Form No III) to the Registrar, whereupon the appeal or application shall be deemed to have been dismissed or refused by the Court.""
20Form No III is in the following terms:
""Criminal Appeal Act 1912(Title of proceedings)Notice of AbandonmentThe                 day of                 19  .I,                               , having given notice of my desire to appeal against my conviction (or against (the judgment or order made on ............... 19..) or the sentence passed upon me upon my conviction) before the [Court], held at                     , hereby give notice that I abandon all further proceedings in respect of my appeal.""  (emphases added)
21Rules 50A-50C govern the determination of appeals and applications:
""Determination of appeals and applications
50A Determination of appeal or application
An appeal or application for leave to appeal is determined on the making of orders disposing of the appeal or application.
50B Entry of order disposing of appeal or application
(1) Any order of the Court is to be entered.
(2) Unless the Court orders otherwise, an order is taken to be entered when it is recorded in the Court's computerised record system.
(3) If the Court orders that the Registrar enter an order by signing and sealing a minute of the order, the order is taken to be entered: 
(a) when a document embodying the order is signed and sealed by the Registrar, or(b) when the order is recorded as referred to in subrule (2),
whichever first occurs.
50C Power to set aside or vary order
(1) The Court may set aside or vary an order if an application for the setting aside or variation is made before entry of the order.
(2) If an application for the setting aside or variation of an order is made within 14 days after the order is entered, the Court may determine the matter, and (if appropriate) set aside or vary the order under subrule (1), as if the order had not been entered.
(3) Within 14 days after an order is entered, the Court may of its own motion set aside or vary the order as if the order had not been entered.
(4) The Court may not extend the time limited by subrule (2) or (3).
(5) Nothing in this rule affects any other power of the Court to set aside or vary an order.""
Further factual matters
22On 30 April 2012, the applicant filed a Form No IV ""Notice of Appeal or Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal"" in which he specified that he appealed against conviction and sentence and specified that the offences of which he was convicted were counts 5 and 6.  In his notice of grounds of appeal filed the same date, the applicant raised two grounds of appeal:
""1. In light of the quashing of the convictions for counts 3 and 4, the convictions for counts 5 and 6 should also be quashed.
2. The verdicts of guilty for counts 5 and 6 were unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence."" 
That appeal was out of time and the Registrar refused an extension of time.  
Issues on the application before the Court
23I have outlined, in broad terms, at [1],  the issues raised by the present application before the Court.  In my opinion, those broad issues raise the following questions for consideration:
(1) Must a jury trial proceed upon a single indictment even where the indictment contains multiple counts?
(2) Can there be more than one appeal from an indictment that contains multiple counts?
(3) If there may only be one appeal from an indictment containing multiple counts, can there be an abandonment of the appeal in respect of some but not all of the counts of which the accused was convicted?
(4) If there can be more than one appeal from an indictment, did the applicant appeal from his convictions on counts 5 and 6 in his original appeal to this Court, so that he is precluded for that reason from bringing the application before the Court?
(5) If the answer to either question 2 or 3 is yes, did the applicant in this case abandon his appeal in respect of counts 5 and 6 on the indictment?
(6) If the applicant abandoned his appeal in respect of counts 5 and 6 on the indictment, should this Court grant leave to appeal in respect of those counts?
(7) If the answer to questions 5 and 6 is yes, and if an appeal from those counts is successful, what orders should this Court make? 
24The first of these questions arises as a preliminary consideration to the issue raised by the second question, which is a jurisdictional question and is therefore central to the determination of the application.  If there can be only one appeal from an indictment, even if there is no ground of appeal in respect of one or more counts of which the accused was convicted, this Court has no jurisdiction to determine the application now before it.  The third question also raises a jurisdictional question.  If there can only be one appeal, the Court will only have jurisdiction to entertain the present application if an applicant can abandon an appeal in respect of some, but not all, counts on the indictment.  
25If there can be more than one appeal, the fourth and fifth questions raise factual matters that require determination.  The sixth and seventh questions relate to the merits of, and the appropriate orders that should be made on, the application if the court has jurisdiction and determines that there was an abandonment of the appeal in respect of the convictions on counts 5 and 6.  
Question (1):  must a jury trial proceed on one indictment only?
26The Criminal Procedure Act 1986, s 5, provides that an offence must be dealt with on indictment, unless it is an offence that is permitted or required to be dealt with summarily.  ""Indictment"" is defined in Ch 2, Pt 2, ""Indictments and Other Matters"", s 15(2), to include, relevantly, ""any ... process ... by which criminal proceedings are commenced"".  Section 23, which also falls within Ch 2 Pt 2, provides that up to three counts may be inserted in the same indictment, against the same person for distinct offences of the same kind committed against the same person.  In this case, s 23 had no application because the offences charged were not committed against the same person.  Section 24 provides that any number of accessories may be charged in the same indictment and tried together, regardless of whether the principal offender is or is not included in the indictment, is not in custody, or is not amenable to justice.  Section 27 provides that the Supreme Court Rules may prescribe the form of indictment.  Supreme Court Rules 1970, Pt 75, Div 1, r 3D prescribes the form of indictment.  
27The Criminal Procedure Act, Ch 3, governs the indictable procedure.  There are provisions relating to the signing of an indictment:  s 126;  the manner of presenting an indictment:  s 127;  and the time within which an indictment is to be presented:  s 129.  Section 130 provides that the court (defined in subs (1) to mean either the Supreme Court or the District Court) has jurisdiction with respect to the conduct of proceedings on the indictment as soon as the indictment is presented and the accused person arraigned.  
28In Swansson v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 67;  69 NSWLR 406, a five judge bench of the Court of Criminal Appeal considered the question whether the trial of a person was a nullity in circumstances where each appellant had been tried, along with other co-accused, upon separate indictments in respect of Commonwealth and State offences with which each was charged.  The criminal conduct giving rise to the charges against each of the accused related to a conspiracy between 10 individuals to import prohibited drugs into Australia.  
29Swansson was charged with offences under the Customs Act and the Criminal Code.  It had been alleged that he had aided and abetted the importation of the drugs into Australia.  A second indictment was presented against Swansson for a State offence, that he knowingly took part in the supply of an amount of a prohibited drug.  The Court was informed, at the time of presentment of this indictment, that it was an alternative charge.  
30Spigelman CJ, at [11], observed that the proposition that there can only be one indictment in any one criminal proceeding was long-established, observing that the rule had been stated in terms, ""one indictment, one jury"".  His Honour noted that the rule was one of criminal procedure.  His Honour accepted that the basis of the rule had never been clearly articulated, but its existence was well-entrenched:  see Crane v Director of Public Prosecutions [1921] 2 AC 299.  
31In Munday v Gill [1930] HCA 20;  44 CLR 38 the High Court, in obiter remarks, accepted Crane as correctly stating the law.  In this regard, Gavan Duffy and Starke JJ commented, at 76:
""... in a trial upon indictment the jury is, and can only be, impanelled and sworn to try the issues of the particular indictment - to find whether the accused be guilty or not guilty upon that indictment and no other.""
32Their Honours observed that the simultaneous trial of several indictments was ""impossible"" and that such a trial was a nullity and without jurisdiction.  Dixon J observed, at 87:
""... there is no way allowed by law of putting in charge of one jury at one time two or more prisoners arraigned upon separate indictments. The jurors are specially chosen for the single purpose of trying one indictment ...""
Isaacs CJ, although dissenting in the case, emphatically supported the ""one indictment one jury"" rule:  see at 52.  
33The Crown had argued in Swansson that the rule was merely a technical procedural rule of no contemporary significance.  However, Spigelman CJ observed, at [27], that the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, which had streamlined criminal procedure in this State, clearly proceeded on the assumption that the ""one indictment one jury"" rule existed as a rule of the common law of criminal procedure.  His Honour noted, for example, that there was no provision in the Criminal Procedure Act for the joint trial of separate indictments, a matter regarded as determinative for upholding the existence of the rule by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria in R v Landy [1943] VLR 73 at 74-75.  
34McClellan CJ at CL (as his Honour then was), Sully J and Howie J agreed with the Chief Justice.  Sully J, at [98], considered the rule not to be ""a mere technicality"", but ""a fundamental norm of a trial upon indictment"".  Howie J considered, at [183], that the principle was a rule of law.  Whilst Simpson J expressed doubt that the rule was anything other than a rule of practice (see at [148]), her Honour was of the opinion that the statements in Munday v Gill were:
""... of such power and force that, in my opinion, it is not now open to this Court to do other than accept that the law is as stated by their Honours.""  (at [151])
35Although it is not necessary to determine the matter for the purposes of the issue before the Court, the observation of Gavan Duffy and Starke JJ that a trial conducted on two indictments was a nullity suggests that this is a rule of law, or, as Mason P said in R v JS [2007] NSWCCA 272;  230 FLR 276, at [165], ""a fundamental aspect of the concept of trial on indictment"":  see Crane and Swansson.  
36In Landy, to which Spigelman CJ referred in Swansson, an accused was tried on separate indictments of offences which, in accordance with the legislation governing criminal proceedings on indictment (the Presentments Act 1916 (Vic), could have been brought on the same indictment.  The Court concluded, following R v McDonnell (1928) 20 Cr App R 163, that the law did not permit an offender to be tried on two indictments at the same time, notwithstanding that the offences could have been contained in the one indictment.  In McDonnell, it was held that a person tried at the one time for two offences, where the offences were contained in separate indictments, had not been properly tried at all and therefore the proceedings were a nullity.  In Landy, Mann CJ observed that the same rule had been applied in Canada.  
37The result, therefore, is that a trial before a jury must proceed on the presentation of a single indictment.  However, the indictment may contain multiple counts.  For the reasons discussed below, this is relevant to the determination of the central issue in this appeal, namely whether there can be only one appeal from a person's conviction of multiple offences on an indictment 
Question (2):  Can there be more than one appeal from an indictment that contains multiple counts?
38Having concluded that a trial must proceed on a single indictment, which may contain multiple counts, the next question that arises is whether there can be more than one appeal in respect of the convictions on the indictment.  The question may be posed another way.  Can one appeal be brought in respect of some of the convictions and a separate appeal brought in respect of other of the convictions of the various counts on the indictment?  This question is the critical question for the Court's determination.  The Crown relied, in support of its submission that one appeal only lay from an indictment, on obiter statements of the High Court in Grierson v R [1938] HCA 45;  60 CLR 431 and on two Western Australian decisions which are referred to below. 
39The question in Grierson was whether an appeal, once determined, may be reopened or whether a second appeal may be brought.  Grierson, who was indicted on two counts and convicted of both, had appealed to the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal.  The appeal was dismissed.  Grierson later purported to bring a second appeal from his convictions on the same two counts on the basis that, since his original appeal, material facts had become known regarding one of the Crown's material witnesses.  The Court of Criminal Appeal refused to reopen the original appeal or to grant leave to bring a fresh appeal:  R v Grierson (1933) 50 WN (NSW) 71.  
40Grierson appealed to the High Court.  Rich J, observing that a person's entitlement to appeal was founded in statute concluded, at 434, that:
""... the jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeal is confined within the limits of the Act and that when the court has heard an appeal on its merits and given its decision the appeal cannot be reopened.""
41Dixon J was of the same opinion.  His Honour observed, at 435, that the Court of Criminal Appeal had held, in accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court of South Australia in R v Edwards [No 2] (1931) SASR 376, that:
""... a second appeal from a conviction could not be entertained after the dismissal, upon the merits, of an appeal or application for leave to appeal and that the first appeal could not be reopened after a final determination.""
42After expressing his agreement with that proposition, Dixon J stated, at 435-436:
""The jurisdiction is statutory, and the court has no further authority to set aside a conviction upon indictment than the statute confers. The Criminal Appeal Act of 1912 N.S.W. ... does not give a general appellate power in criminal cases exercisable on grounds and by a procedure discoverable from independent sources. It defines the grounds, prescribes the procedure and states the duty of the court. The statute deals with criminal appeals rather as a right or benefit conferred on prisoners convicted of indictable offences and sets out the kind of convictions and sentences from which they may appeal and lays down the conditions on which they may appeal as of right and by leave and the procedure which they must observe. It limits the time within which appeals and applications for leave to appeal may be brought, subject, however, to a discretionary power in the court to extend the period except where the sentence is capital. The grounds or principles upon which the court is to determine appeals are stated, and the duty is imposed on the court of dismissing an appeal, unless on those principles it determines that it should be allowed. The determination of an appeal is evidently definitive, and a conviction unappealed is equally final.""  (emphasis added)
43McTiernan J, at 437, agreed with the reasons of Rich and Dixon JJ.  
44Starke J, at 435, also considered that the application should be dismissed, expressing entire agreement with the reasons of Jordan CJ in the New South Wales Supreme Court, where Jordan CJ had stated:
""When an appeal has once been fully heard and disposed of, that is, in my opinion, an end of the matter ... and the prisoner cannot continue to appeal from time to time thereafter, whenever a new point occurs to him ... or whenever a new fact is alleged to have come to light.""
45The principle in Grierson that an appellate court had no jurisdiction to reopen an appeal that had been determined on the merits was endorsed by the plurality in Burrell v The Queen [2008] HCA 34;  238 CLR 218 at [24].  The Court in Burrell, at [26], found it unnecessary to consider whether there were qualifications grafted onto that general rule, and in particular, if there was any exception based upon a denial of procedural fairness.  If there were such qualifications, the plurality held they were to be sourced in the Criminal Appeal Act. 
46The Crown relied upon two Western Australian decisions in which Grierson had been applied:  Matta v The Queen (1995) 126 FLR 127 and Napier v State of Western Australia [2008] WASCA 106;  36 WAR 543.  In Matta, the applicant had been charged with three drug offences, two contravening Commonwealth law and the third offence contravening a State law.  The applicant was found guilty by unanimous verdicts of guilty in respect of each count.  The applicant filed an application for an extension of time to appeal on the basis that the trial judge had erred in law by directing the jury that he would accept a majority verdict.  Whilst a majority verdict was available in respect of the State offence, it was precluded in respect of the Commonwealth offences pursuant to The Constitution, s 80, as had been determined by the High Court in Cheatle v The Queen [1993] HCA 44;  177 CLR 541.
47The application for extension of time was refused on the basis that there was no merit in the proposed appeal in circumstances where the jury had brought in unanimous verdicts in respect of both the Commonwealth and State offences.  Relevantly for the question presently under discussion, the applicant's counsel, in the course of the hearing of the application for extension of time, informed the court that the applicant wished to appeal only against the convictions for the two Commonwealth offences.  
48Subsequently, the applicant filed a further application for extension of time to appeal against all counts on the basis that certain evidence had been wrongly admitted.  The Crown opposed the application contending that the proposed appeal was not competent by reason of the Court's earlier refusal to extend time.  
49Pidgeon J, at 128-129, noted that Grierson was authority for the proposition that a second appeal or application for leave to appeal from a conviction cannot be entertained after its dismissal upon the merits.  His Honour considered, at 129, that this rule was binding even where different grounds were put forward in the second application.  See also R v Wickliffe [1986] 1 NZLR 4.  His Honour concluded, on the basis of the reasoning in Grierson, that it made no difference whether the Court had refused an extension of time as distinct from refusing an application for leave to appeal.  His Honour observed that in Grierson, Dixon J had stated that the principle applied both to an appeal or application for leave to appeal.  Pidgeon J considered, at 129-130, that similar reasoning applied to an application for extension of time, because the determination of that application involved a consideration of the merits of the proposed grounds of appeal.
50His Honour held that the position was no different where, in the original application for an extension of time, the proposed appeal on the State count had not been considered on its merits.  As his Honour noted, at 130:
""It is not open to lodge separate appeals on each count of a multiple indictment.  There is one appeal.""  
51Rowland J, at 130, agreed with the reasons of Pidgeon J.  Owen J also agreed with his Honour's reasons, but added additional comments on the question of multiple appeals.  His Honour stated, at 131, that once an appeal had been heard on the merits, all statutory rights of appeal were exhausted and any further appeal was incompetent:  see Grierson at 435-436.  It was irrelevant, on his Honour's approach, that the second application was based on different proposed grounds of appeal from those advanced on the earlier occasion.  His Honour considered that this principle applied, whether or not the question arose on a substantive appeal or on an application to extend time in which to appeal.  
52Owen J had earlier observed, at 130, that on an application for an extension of time, the merits of the proposed appeal fell, ""almost inevitably"", for consideration.  This was particularly so where there was no satisfactory explanation for the delay, so that the merits of the proposed appeal would become the dominant consideration.  In his Honour's opinion, the merits of the proposed appeal on the Commonwealth counts had been considered on the first application.  It followed that the second application in respect of those counts was incompetent.  This was so notwithstanding that an appeal, at least in respect of the Commonwealth counts, would almost certainly succeed having regard to the principles stated in Ridgeway v R [1995] HCA 66;  184 CLR 19 in respect of the discretion to exclude unlawfully obtained evidence. 
53Owen J then gave separate consideration to the application in respect of the State count.  His Honour observed that the proposed grounds of appeal advanced on the first application were drafted in terms challenging the convictions on both the State and Commonwealth convictions.  However, during the course of the hearing of that application, counsel had informed the Court that the application for leave to appeal and the proposed appeal would be pursued, if an extension of time was granted, only in relation to the Commonwealth convictions.  This was because the proposed grounds drafted in the original notice of appeal, challenging the trial judge's direction that he would accept a majority verdict, could only succeed in relation to the Commonwealth counts.  
54Owen J observed, at 131-132:  
""The applicant did not formally abandon the application for an extension of time within which to appeal against the State convictions and nor was the application formally amended.  It was simply not pursued.""
55His Honour continued, at 132:
""Counsel for the applicant indicated to this Court that when the decision was made not to pursue the appeal in relation to the State counts the decision in Ridgeway was known to those advising the applicant but a position had not been taken on it.  No mention was made to the Court in the earlier proceedings that the grounds might be enlarged to encompass the Ridgeway principle.  In the circumstances I think that the dismissal by the Court of the application for an extension of time in the earlier proceedings must be taken to be a dismissal of the application in relation to all convictions.""  
56It followed, in his Honour's opinion, that the application to extend time in respect of the State count was also incompetent.  
57The question of the competency of a second application to extend time to appeal was again considered by the Western Australian Court of Appeal in Napier.  That case involved a single count of murder of which the appellant had been convicted.  An application to extend time in which to appeal was refused after the Court considered that the delay in bringing the application was inexcusable and that none of the proposed grounds of appeal had any substance.  Some 15 years later, the appellant brought a further application for an extension of time in which to appeal.  The question in issue before the Court was whether the second application was competent.
58Steytler P (McLure and Buss JJA agreeing) noted, at [24], that notwithstanding that the dismissal of the first application for an extension of time was an interlocutory order, not a final determination of the merits of the appeal, the parties had accepted that the Court's decision in Matta was correctly decided.  His Honour also observed that the provisions of the WA Criminal Code were in similar terms to those of the Criminal Appeal Act, considered in Grierson.  His Honour concluded that because the refusal of the first application resulted from a consideration of the merits of the proposed grounds of appeal, the decision was to be treated as if it dismissed the appeal.  It followed that the second application was incompetent.  
59Matta was also applied by the Court in Sherkam v Parker [2002] WASCA 179, where the Court stated, at [6] and [7], that the relevant statute provided for one appeal from a conviction.  It was irrelevant that different grounds of appeal might be sought to be advanced in a second appeal.
60In R v Brain [1999] SASC 358;  74 SASR 92, the South Australian Court of Criminal Appeal stated, at [46]:
""It is well established that the legislation is to be read as permitting only one appeal against conviction and only one appeal against sentence. There are powerful legal and practical reasons for so deciding. It suffices to refer to the following decisions binding this Court: R v Edwards (No 2) [1931] SASR 376; Grierson v The King (1938) 60 CLR 431; The Queen v Shannon (1982) 32 SASR 5; R v Caruso (1988) 49 SASR 465; Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295. The same view has been taken of similar legislation in other States: Saxon (1998) 101 A Crim R 71 (Court of Criminal Appeal, New South Wales); Stone (1989) 42 A Crim R 189 (Court of Criminal Appeal, Western Australia); R v McNamara (No 2) [1997] 1 VR 257 (Court of Appeal, Victoria).""  (emphasis added)
61A consideration of the authorities referred to in Brain confirms that only one appeal lies from an indictment, regardless of whether there is one or more than one conviction on the indictment.
62In R v Reardon [2004] NSWCCA 197;  60 NSWLR 454 Hodgson JA (Simpson and Barr JJ agreeing) observed, at [41], that Grierson was authority for the proposition that once an appeal had been heard and determined and the order perfected, there is no jurisdiction to re-open the appeal.  His Honour accepted that this principle was subject to the slip rule, cases of fraud and possibly where there had been a breach of procedural fairness.  In regard to the last of these matters, his Honour stated, at [41]:
""Failure to deal with an argument that has been advanced, or deciding an appeal on a basis not properly argued, although possibly amounting to a denial of procedural fairness and thereby to an error of law, could not of itself in my opinion be a failure to determine the appeal such as could avoid the operation of the principle in Grierson.""
63In R v McGrane [2012] QCA 221, the Court stated that it had ""no jurisdiction to hear a further appeal"".  The Court referred, inter alia, to Grierson.  See also R v Nudd [2007] QCA 40 and R v Lumley [2009] QCA 172 as supporting this proposition.  
64In Arnaout v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 278;  191 A Crim R 149, the Court was concerned with an appeal against sentence of a person convicted of seven separate offences.  The Crown had argued that even if sentencing error was established, the Court would not intervene, as no other sentence was warranted in law:  Criminal Procedure Act, s 6(3).  An issue as to the proper construction of s 6(3) arose and, in particular, in determining whether to re-sentence, the Court was concerned only with the individual sentence or sentences subject of the appeal, or whether it extended to those not subject of the appeal.  
65Whilst the provisions of s 6(3) are not relevant to the present appeal, the applicant relied upon the remarks of Basten JA, at [20], where his Honour stated:
""It follows that the use of the singular form of 'sentence' in s 6(3) does not mean an aggregation of sentences, merely because use of the singular may import the plural. No doubt an appeal under s 5(1) may relate to more than one conviction or sentence; but if an offender appeals against one only of three convictions, the court is not empowered to consider the validity of other convictions.""
66The applicant submitted that his Honour's remarks supported his submission that the Court was empowered to consider the validity of the convictions in relation to counts 5 and 6 because there had been no appeal against those convictions.  It was submitted that this was so, notwithstanding that the original notice of appeal referred to those counts.  The applicant's argument was that there was no appeal from those convictions because none of the grounds of appeal related to counts 5 and 6.  
67This submission, in my opinion, faces two difficulties.  First, it begs the question whether there was an appeal against the convictions on counts 5 and 6.  That matter is considered below in question four.  Secondly, it fails to grapple with the question, which I consider is central to the applicant's present application before the Court, whether separate appeals may be brought against individual convictions tried on the one indictment.
68In this regard, in Arnaout, Basten JA had also said, in a passage not referred to by the applicant:
""The question is not whether separate 'appeals' are required in relation to separate sentences ... but rather to identify the matter with respect to which an applicant has sought to invoke this Court's jurisdiction.""  (emphasis added)
69Basten JA referred to the observation of Price J at [80], where his Honour had stated, in unequivocal terms:
""Where an offender has been convicted of more than one offence and more than one sentence is imposed, there is one appeal to this Court although that appeal may be founded on a number of grounds.""  (emphasis added)
Price J thus considered that the reference to ""sentence"" in s 6(3) was a reference to the aggregate sentence and was not confined to the sentence imposed in respect of which the appeal was brought.  Although Basten JA did not, as I understand his Honour's reasons, commit himself to a view as to whether only one appeal lay:  see at [20], Price J's observation, albeit obiter, is consistent with the statements in Grierson and Matta to which I have referred.  
70The ratio of Grierson is that an appeal against conviction is final and cannot be reopened, subject only to the rules of Court which allow an appeal to be revisited if application is made within the time prescribed by the rules.  The observations in Grierson to which I have referred tend to suggest a negative answer to the question under consideration, particularly the comment of Dixon J that an appeal is determinative and that a conviction from which there is no appeal is final. 
71There is an observation in Matta by Pidgeon JA, agreed with by the other members of the Court, that there is only one appeal from an indictment containing multiple counts.  Having regard to the matter that was in issue in that case, that comment was, in my opinion, part of the ratio of the case.  
72The same issue arose in R v Saxon (1998) 101 A Crim R 71, where the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal reviewed the decisions of this Court and other State intermediate appellate courts which had held that there may only be one appeal notwithstanding that an indictment may contain a number of different counts.  Smart J held, at 81, that the present case fell within the terms of Grierson.  No suggestion was made by counsel on the argument on appeal that Saxon or the other cases in which this question has arisen, whether as part of the ratio or by way of dicta, were wrong or should not be followed.  
73In any event, I consider that these decisions correctly state the law.  This flows, in my opinion, from the one indictment/one jury rule considered in Swansson and from the principle of finality of litigation.  If there can only be one indictment presented to a jury of the counts which are charged against an accused person, any appeal must be from the verdicts on the indictment.  Were it otherwise, the principle of finality of litigation would be offended.  
74The principle of finality of litigation was examined by the High Court in D'Orta-Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid [2005] HCA 12;  223 CLR 1 at [34]:
""A central and pervading tenet of the judicial system is that controversies, once resolved, are not to be reopened except in a few, narrowly defined, circumstances.""
75In Burrell the Court emphasised that the reargument or reagitation of issues already decided by a court involves an unacceptable and, indeed, unavailable, departure from the principle of finality:  see especially at [15], [16] and [19];  see also Kirby J at [98].  See also Eastman v R [2008] FCAFC 62;  166 FCR 579.  
76If more than one appeal was allowed from convictions of different counts on an indictment, there may well be an overlapping of issues in the different appeals.  There may also be a determination in one appeal which would conflict with the determination in the second appeal.  
77The present case is an example.  The Crown case was that the money which was the subject of count 6 was the proceeds of the robbery of the Drummoyne Hotel, being the robbery subject of count 3.  The evidence relating to Count 6 was thus directly relevant to count 3.  If separate appeals were permissible from the conviction on the robbery count (count 3) and from the possession of the proceeds of crime count (count 6), differently constituted courts could arrive at different conclusions as to whether the respective convictions were unreasonable and inconsistent with the evidence.  
78Subject to the question of abandonment, it follows in my opinion, therefore, that this Court does not have jurisdiction to hear and determine a second appeal in respect of counts 5 and 6.  
Question (3):  Abandonment 
79The next question that arises for consideration is whether there can be an abandonment of the appeal in respect of some but not all convictions on the indictment. 
80The Criminal Appeal Rules, r 27 permits an abandonment of an appeal (described as a ""procedural dismissal"":  R v Bell (1987) 8 NSWLR 311 at 314).  The court, in its inherent jurisdiction, is entitled to go behind the Rule because there has been no determination on the merits and will do so if the maintenance of the abandonment would lead to a miscarriage of justice.  As Dixon J explained in Grierson at 436-437:
""If the prisoner has abandoned his appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeal in England will exercise a discretion to allow him to withdraw his notice of abandonment, notwithstanding that it operates as a dismissal of the appeal ... But in such a case there has been no determination by the court, and there is no English case in which, after such a determination, an appeal has been reopened or a fresh appeal has been entertained.""
81It is relevant to observe that the Form No III Notice of Abandonment, set out at [20] of these reasons, is drafted on the basis of there being an abandonment of the appeal, that is, the appeal from the convictions of the counts on the indictment.  It is not premised on the possibility of an abandonment of some only of the grounds of appeal or the abandonment of some only of the convictions on an indictment.  
82If there can only be only one appeal, it seems to me that the appeal is either proceeded with or abandoned.  There cannot be an abandonment of a portion of the appeal leaving open the possibility of a further or fresh appeal in respect of the abandoned part.  If a convicted person decides not to pursue part of the appeal so as not to contest a conviction on some counts, the consequence, in my opinion, is that there has been a determination of the appeal.  The position in such a case is that described in Grierson by Dixon J in the emphasised portion in the passage set out at [42] above, viz:  ""The determination of an appeal is evidently definitive, and a conviction unappealed is equally final"".  
83Accordingly, even if the appeal in respect of convictions on some counts is not argued the effect, in my opinion, is that those convictions go unchallenged.  Being unchallenged, they will not be the subject of a specific order of the Court in its determination of the appeal, but those convictions are nonetheless final and are not amenable to a separate appeal.  Were it otherwise, the principle of finality discussed in the previous section of these reasons would be offended for the same reasons as are discussed there.  
84Therefore, it is not open to the applicant to argue that, in respect of his original appeal, he had abandoned his appeal on counts 5 and 6.  Accordingly, I consider that the appeal should be dismissed and the other questions identified at [23] above do not arise for consideration.  However, should I be wrong in this conclusion, I will express my views on the other questions, but I do so relatively briefly.
Question (4):  If there can be more than one appeal, did the applicant appeal from his convictions on counts 5 and 6 in the original appeal?
85The Crown submitted that, even if there may be more than one appeal where there are multiple counts on the indictment, the applicant appealed against his convictions on counts 5 and 6 in his original appeal so that there has been a final determination of his appeal on all counts.  This submission was based essentially on the provisions of r 24(2) (set out above at [17]).  For the purposes of understanding the effect of r 24(2), it is convenient to refer to the prescribed form for a notice of appeal or notice of application for leave to appeal, being prescribed Form No IV.  
86The information required to be included in Form No IV is as follows:  the name of the appellant;  the date of birth of the appellant;  the lower court file number;  and a statement as to whether the appellant appeals against conviction only, conviction and sentence, or sentence only.  Details of the plea entered at trial must be given, that is, either guilty or not guilty.  
87The form also requires that the court, that is, the Supreme Court or the District Court, be specified, as well as the location of the court of trial.  In addition, the following information must be given:  the name of the trial or sentencing judge, the dates of trial and sentence hearing, the date of sentence, the offences of which the person was convicted;  the longest sentence;  the non-parole period;  the location of the gaol in which the person is held if in custody;  and, if not in custody, the person's residential address.  The appellant's legal representative must be nominated.  The appellant is also required to state whether he or she wishes to be present at the hearing of the appeal, the preferred hearing date for the appeal and the estimated length of hearing.   
88Prescribed Form No IV also requires a response to the question, ""CONVICTED OF (list all offences)"".  In response to that requirement, the applicant's notice of appeal, in respect of his original appeal, particularised his convictions on counts 2 to 6 inclusive. 
89The particulars required by Form No IV perform a number of functions.  Some are administrative.  For example, the requirement that the details of the trial court's file are required so as to enable the Court to ensure that the appellate Court has the correct file in its possession.  The information as to whether the appellant wishes to attend is required so that the appropriate steps can be taken to bring the person to the Court for the hearing of the appeal if that person is in custody.  
90However, some of the particulars required have substantive implications.  This is particularly so in the specification of the type of appeal and the counts on which the person was convicted.  The form requires that all counts upon which the applicant was convicted must be specified in the notice of appeal.  Rule 24(2) specifies that the answers to the questions on the form are taken to be applications to the Court in respect of those matters.  The applicant, as the form required him to do, included counts 5 and 6 in his original notice of appeal.  
91It follows, as the Crown correctly contended, that the combination of the terms of the applicant's original notice of appeal and the effect given to that form by r 24(2), that the applicant's original appeal included an appeal in respect of counts 5 and 6.  As the Court has determined the appeal arising from that notice of appeal, I am of the opinion that there can be no further appeal in respect of those counts. 
92For that reason also, the present application must be dismissed. 
Question (5):  Did the applicant abandon that part of his original appeal in respect of his conviction on counts 5 and 6?
93This question also only arises if I am wrong in all that I have determined thus far.  
94In the present case, no notice of abandonment was filed.  Leaving that aside for the moment, and also assuming that there could be an abandonment of the appeal in respect of the convictions on counts 5 and 6, the abandonment occurred in circumstances where the applicant had given instructions to appeal against all convictions and the notice of intention to appeal referred to all convictions.  However, there were no grounds of appeal directed to those convictions, nor did the written submissions address them.  The Crown's written submissions, filed nearly two weeks before the hearing of the appeal, drew attention to this.  It was expressly noted in the submissions that whilst the bundling of the cash subject of the charge in count 6 supported the conviction on count 3, no challenge had been made by the applicant to the verdict on count 6.  
95On the hearing of the original appeal, senior counsel for the applicant did not advance any argument in respect of the convictions on those counts and informed the Court, in response to a question from the Court, that there was no appeal in respect of those counts.  It should also be observed that the written submissions of senior counsel for the applicant filed for the purposes of the appeal were detailed and were filed nearly four months before the hearing of the appeal.  
96In my opinion, senior counsel's response to his Honour's question as to the remaining two counts not being ""the subject of any appeal"" tends to indicate that counsel was informing the court that it had never been intended to pursue an appeal in respect of counts 5 and 6.  If that is so there could not be an abandonment of something that had never been pursued.  Accordingly, notwithstanding that there was some reasonably available argument that what occurred was an abandonment, on a review of all of the material, I am not satisfied that there was an abandonment.  In any event, as I have already concluded, there could not be an abandonment of part of an appeal. 
Questions (6) and (7)
97Given my determinations thus far, I can deal with questions (6) and (7) together and briefly.  
98In determining whether to exercise its jurisdiction to go behind an abandonment, the court will in the first instance ascertain how the notice of abandonment came to be filed and then have regard to the prospects of the success of the appeal if leave to appeal were granted:  Bell at 314;  R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243 per Hunt and Badgery-Parker JJ at 246.  
99In assessing the circumstances in which a notice of abandonment was filed, a court would be likely to grant leave to withdraw the notice if it was established that the applicant had signed it without fully appreciating its effect, or as a result of fraud or bad legal advice:  see Cartwright at 246.  It is also established that even if the explanation proffered for the appeal having been abandoned is weak, the principal consideration will be whether there would be a miscarriage of justice if leave to withdraw the notice of abandonment were refused:  Bell at 315;  Cartwright at 246.
100The Crown conceded that if the Court concluded that what occurred during the course of the hearing of the appeal constituted an abandonment, then the appropriate order to make in respect of count 5 was that the conviction be quashed and that there be a retrial.  The Crown case was that the money subject of count 6 was the proceeds of the robbery at the Willoughby Hotel.  Accordingly, the evidence in respect of count 6 was inextricably linked with the evidence in count 3 and, as the Crown recognised, had the appeal been argued in respect of count 6, the Court would have quashed that count and ordered a retrial.  The concession was fair in the sense that it involved a recognition that there would be a miscarriage of justice in respect of count 6 if the applicant was refused leave to withdraw from the abandonment, as I am presently assuming occurred and could occur.  
101It was but slightly more arguable that the Court may not have quashed the conviction on count 5.  However, the Crown conceded there would be a miscarriage of justice if count 5 was not quashed.  Accordingly, if the Court had jurisdiction I am satisfied that count 5 also ought to be quashed.  
102In circumstances where the Crown has decided not to require the applicant to stand trial again in respect of counts 3 and 4, I am of the opinion that there would be no prospect of the applicant being convicted on counts 5 and 6.  It would follow, that if the Court had jurisdiction to hear and determine an appeal in respect of the convictions on counts 5 and 6, there should be a verdict of acquittal on those counts.  
103Absent jurisdiction however, the only order this Court can make is that the application is dismissed.

2706893,"LIPCHIN, Sharon v R [2013] NSWCCA 77","Judgment
1BATHURST CJ:  I agree with Hidden J.
2HIDDEN J:  This is an unusual case.  The applicant, Sharon Lipchin, a mature woman in her forties, was tried in the District Court for a number of counts of sexual assault, arising out of the same incident, upon a 15 year old boy.  They were as follows:
Count 1:  indecent assault upon a person under 16 years of age, an offence under s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, carrying a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 10 years and a standard non-parole period of 8 years;
Count 2: aggravated sexual intercourse without consent (complainant under the age of 16 years), an offence under s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act, carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment;
Count 3 (alternative to count 2):  sexual intercourse with a person aged between 14 and 16 years: an offence under s 66C(3) of the Act, carrying a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment;
Count 4:  attempted sexual intercourse with a person aged between 10 and 16 years, an offence under s 66D of the Act, also carrying a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment;
Count 5:  a further count of indecent assault upon a person under the age of 16 years.  
3The applicant was found guilty of counts 1, 3, 4 & 5.  For count 3, sexual intercourse with a person between the ages of 14 and 16 years, which the trial judge saw as the most serious of the offences, she was sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 2 ½ years, commencing on 16 June 2011, the date on which sentence was passed.  For the remaining counts she was sentenced to terms of imprisonment which were concurrent with that sentence.  For the two counts of indecent assault (counts 1 and 5), she was sentenced to a fixed term of 1 year and 2 years respectively, each to commence on 16 June 2011.  For the count of attempted sexual intercourse (count 4) she was sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 18 months, to date from 16 June 2012.  
4Thus, the sentence of 5 years with a non-parole period of 2 ½ years for count 3 was also the overall sentence.  The applicant seeks leave to appeal against those sentences.  The application is out of time, for reasons explained in an affidavit of the applicant.  An extension of time was not opposed by the Crown prosecutor and should be granted.
Facts
5The offences occurred on 27 February 2010 at the applicant's home, where she lived with her husband and her son.  The male victim, then aged 15 years, was a friend of her son.  The applicant was 41 at the time.  She was drinking wine and she persuaded the victim to join her.  He was of the Jewish faith, and he did so although he told her that he did not usually drink wine except at the Friday prayer session traditionally observed by members of that faith.  As the trial judge put it in his remarks on sentence, she ""plied him with wine and then commenced a process of sexual activity.""  
6She kissed him (the indecent assault the subject of count 1), and then took him to another room.  There she removed his pants and rubbed the area of his crotch through his underpants (indecent assault - count 5).  She then fellated him (sexual intercourse with a person aged between 14 and 16 years - count 3).  After that she attempted to place his penis into her vagina, without success (attempted sexual intercourse - count 4).  
7As she was attempting to achieve penile penetration she heard a noise, which apparently was her husband coming home.  She told the victim to get dressed, and asked him to come back the following week when they would ""repeat the session.""  The victim left in a state of confusion.  The following day he spoke to a friend, and asked him if it was possible to make a woman pregnant by slight penile penetration of her vagina.  He became very concerned about that matter, and ultimately told his father what had happened.  His father took him to the police and the applicant was later charged.  
8His Honour noted in his remarks that it was ""clear from a victim impact statement that he was considerably upset by this, was left in a state of confusion and for a while was quite concerned that somehow or other he might have got Mrs Lipchin pregnant.""  His Honour described her as ""a predator"", noting that ""she went after him, she tried to induce him or she persuaded him to have sexual contact with her, she forced herself on him and she sought to see if this arrangement could continue at a later point.""
Subjective case
9The applicant had no prior convictions.  She and her family were also members of the Jewish community, having come from South Africa to this country after living for some time in New Zealand.  Her son, also in his early teens at the time, had suffered from an early age from autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and a pervasive developmental disorder.  His intellectual functioning is within the average range, but he was assessed by an autism service as having moderately low communication skills, living skills, socialisation skills and adaptive behaviour.  His adaptive skills were found to be lower than 96% of other young men of his own age.  
10At the time of sentence the applicant had been the only provider for the family, as her husband had not worked for some months.  Her son had a much closer relationship with her than he did with his father.  As his Honour put it, the autism service set out her son's situation ""in fairly bleak terms"" and, while it did not go so far as to say that he could not survive in the community without her, it was obvious that he would have ""great difficulties"" in doing so.
11His Honour had regard to these sad circumstances in determining sentence.  On the other hand, he noted that the applicant's case at trial was that she had not had any sexual contact with the victim and that she continued to maintain her innocence, leading to a finding that she had shown no remorse for her offending behaviour.  That said, he also noted that she acknowledged having a problem with alcohol and had stopped drinking, and that a well qualified forensic psychologist, who prepared a report, was of the opinion that she was unlikely to commit offences of this kind again.  His Honour found that she was unlikely to re-offend in the light of that opinion, and having regard to the fact that she was not in a relationship with the victim and the offences occurred on one occasion only.  As is apparent from the proportion of the non-parole period to the sentence in respect of count 3, he also found special circumstances.
The application
12Counsel for the applicant, Mr Gartelmann, argued the application on two bases: that his Honour erred in failing to set a non-parole period for the counts of indecent assault, for which a standard non-parole period was prescribed, and that the sentences are manifestly excessive (as that ground expressed it, ""unreasonable and plainly unjust."")
Indecent assault counts
13It is common ground that his Honour fell into error in failing to specify non-parole periods for the indecent assault charges (counts 1 and 5).  As I have said, both these counts were laid under s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act, carrying a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 8 years.  His Honour commented in his remarks upon the obvious incongruity of a standard non-parole period which is such a high proportion of the maximum sentence, but that is not a matter which needs to be considered for present purposes.  A court cannot decline to set a non-parole period for an offence to which a standard non-parole period applies: s 45(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
14The argument on this ground was confined to whether his Honour assessed the fixed terms for those offences by reference to the non-parole periods he would have set if he had not imposed fixed terms, or whether he considered them to be the appropriate sentence in each case.  His Honour found that both offences were of ""much less than mid-range seriousness"", noting that they could have been dealt with by a magistrate if they had been the only charges.  Of the two, he saw the touching of the victim's crotch area the subject of count 5 as the more serious.  As set out above, for that offence he imposed a sentence of 2 years, whereas the sentence for count 1, the kissing, was 12 months.  When passing both of those sentences he noted that each was ""much less than the standard non-parole period.""
15The Crown prosecutor in this court submitted that what his Honour said should be interpreted as an intention to impose what would have been non-parole periods for each offence.  Mr Gartelmann argued the contrary, relying on his Honour's assessment of the objective gravity of each offence as low and his observation that, standing alone, they could have been dealt with summarily.
16There is a considerable line of authority in this court, both under the current sentencing legislation and its predecessor, the Sentencing Act 1989, equating fixed terms with non-parole periods.  In particular, that has been the court's approach in a number of cases in which a sentencing judge had passed a fixed term in respect of an offence carrying a standard non-parole period.  In those cases the court has treated the fixed term as equivalent to the appropriate non-parole period and has intervened by increasing the length of the overall sentence.  However, that has not always been the approach, and in other cases the court has treated the fixed term as the head sentence and fixed a non-parole period in respect of it.
17This emerges from the judgment of R A Hulme J in Collier v R [2012] NSWCCA 213, at [52] ff.  His Honour noted at [52] that it was not necessary in that case to resolve the question ""whether this Court can or should increase the overall term of a sentence where at first instance there has been an error in failing to set a non-parole period.""  He examined twenty-six cases in this court in which the nature of a fixed term was in issue, not all of them involving standard non-parole period offences, and noted that in none of them was there any reference to the terms of the relevant legislation: [58].  He observed that ""the discretion provided in s 45 of the current legislation is to decline to set a non-parole period.""  Speaking of that section and its predecessor (s 6 of the Sentencing Act 1989) he added that neither of them ""provided, in terms, for a discretion to reduce a sentence by not including within it an additional term, or parole period.""  (The expression ""fixed term"" derives from the 1989 Act and, although it continues to be used, it is not to be found in the current Act.)  
18His Honour concluded at [62]:
""Whether a sentencing court has the power within the terms of s 45 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to reduce what would otherwise be the appropriate sentence by setting a fixed term of imprisonment is a question best left for resolution in an appropriate case in the future.  Resolution of that question will also bear upon whether, in an appeal against the severity of a sentence, this Court can or should increase the sentence where a fixed term has been erroneously imposed.""
19The issue does not need to be resolved in this case either.  In any event, as the Chief Justice observed during argument, a question arises whether it is necessary to resolve it in cases such as this given that, error having been identified, this court is free to re-sentence in the exercise of its own discretion.
20Without denying the seriousness of any offence under s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act, reflected in the maximum sentence and the fact that the offence carries a standard non-parole period, it must be said that the two offences here are very low in the range of objective gravity.  In my view, the fixed terms of imprisonment which his Honour imposed were adequate sentences for each of them.  Non-parole periods in respect of each of them should have been set.  No purpose would now be served by correcting the sentence for the first count, which has expired.  However, the sentence for the fifth count continues to run and a non-parole period must be specified, although the period I propose will have expired.  
21In respect of that sentence I would specify a non-parole period of 50%, consistent with the proportion which his Honour determined to be appropriate in respect of the overall sentence.  Accordingly, for that count I would fix a non-parole period of 12 months, commencing on 16 June 2011.  
Manifestly excessive?
22The ground of manifest excess is directed to all the sentences but, as one would expect, the focus of the argument was the sentence of 5 years with a non-parole period of 2 ½ years on count 3.  
23An important question in determining the appropriate sentence for offences of this kind was expressed by Badgery-Parker J, with whom Gleeson CJ and Wood J agreed, in R v Sea (CCA, unreported, 13 August 1990).  At p 4 of the judgment, after referring to English authority dealing with the wide range of circumstances of offences of carnal knowledge, his Honour said:
""If one tries to draw a line through all of the cases it seems to me that one of the most significant matters and, indeed, probably the most significant of the matters which determine where a particular offence is to be placed in the spectrum of offences of this kind must be expressed in terms of the degree to which the offender is seen to have exploited the youth of the girl.""
24That passage has been cited with approval more recently by Latham J, with whom Brownie AJA and Buddin J agreed, in R v KNL [2005] NSWCCA 260, 154 A Crim R 268, at [41].  Of course, that passage is pertinent whether the victim be male or female and, obviously, the age of the victim is an important factor going to the gravity of an offence of this kind.  As Latham J observed in KNL at [42], ""in terms of the position occupied by a given offence on the spectrum of offences of this kind, the younger the child, the more serious the offence ... .""
25Mr Gartelmann noted that the victim in the present case was close to 16 years old, the upper limit of the age range for the offence, being almost 15 years and 11 months.  Otherwise, as to the objective gravity of the offence, he relied upon the fact that it was an isolated, brief and apparently unplanned incident, without any force, threat or coercion to procure the victim's submission or to persuade him to make no complaint.  All that is true, although the fact remains that the episode was to a significant degree exploitative of the victim's youth.  I have referred to his Honour's characterisation of it as predatory, the applicant having initiated the sexual activity after persuading the victim to consume an amount of alcohol to which he was clearly not accustomed.
26Mr Gartelmann relied upon Judicial Commission statistics of sentence for the offence under s 66C(3) of the Crimes Act, together with seven decisions of this court in which sentences for that offence were considered.  In chronological order those cases were:
- R v Romano [2004] NSWCCA 380, - Boulad v R [2005] NSWCCA 289,- R v Katon [2008] NSWCCA 228, - Salvatore v R [2009] NSWCCA 104,- Kenny v R [2010] NSWCCA 6,- Mokhaiber v R [2011] NSWCCA 10,- R v Chishimba & Ors [2011] NSWCCA 212 (focusing on the case of one of the co-appellants, Makasa).
27All of these cases involved a victim who was 15 years old, or very close to it.  As one would expect, they display a wide variety of circumstances and a very wide range of sentence for the offence in question: from a fixed term of 10 months to a sentence of 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years.  In all but one of them the offender had pleaded guilty.  In four of them (Romano, Katon, Salvatore and Makasa) the offences under s 66C(3) were accompanied by other related offences, and the sentences for them were part of a structure of sentences designed to embrace the whole of the criminality involved.
28In oral argument, Mr Gartelmann acknowledged that it was difficult to draw a line through these cases so as to discern a pattern of sentence.  That said, two cases involving very lenient sentences should be mentioned.  In Kenny an appeal against sentence was (unsurprisingly) dismissed, the offender having been sentenced for two offences under s 66C(3) to a term of 2 years with a non-parole period of 1 year and 3 months for one of them and a good behaviour bond for the other.  Suffice to say that in that case the circumstances of the offences were unusual and the offender made out an exceptional subjective case.  
29Makasa (Chishimba & Ors) was an appeal against conviction, in which the Crown cross-appealed against sentence.  In Makasa's case, concurrent sentences of 2 years with a non-parole period of 1 year for three offences under s 66C(3) were confirmed, although they were described as ""lenient.""  It must be understood, however, that those sentences were themselves concurrent with a much longer sentence which had been passed at first instance in respect of a related offence under s 61J of the Crimes Act.  The conviction for that offence was quashed on appeal, by which time Makasa had been in custody for longer than the period of the sentence for the remaining offences. 
30The statistics for the s 66C(3) offence for the period from October 2004 to September 2011 (which embraces the present case) show that of the ninety-two cases recorded, fifty-four (59%) were dealt with by prison terms.  Of those, only five resulted in sentences of 5 years or more.  It is apparent, however, that the great majority of those cases were pleas of guilty.  Statistics provided by the Crown prosecutor for the period from April 2005 to March 2012 reveal only five cases of sentence after a plea of not guilty.  Of those, two were for terms of 5 years (this case, presumably, being one of them).  Of course, these figures should be approached with the caution this court has so often counselled.
31The Crown prosecutor submitted that the sentence for count 3 was appropriate, given his Honour's assessment of its objective gravity and the fact that the applicant could not claim leniency for a plea of guilty.  She added that his Honour's finding of special circumstances had led to a generous reduction of the non-parole period from the statutory proportion.  These are undoubtedly significant matters but, after careful reflection, I have come to the conclusion that the sentence is more than was called for in all the circumstances.  In arriving at that conclusion I have not been materially assisted by the cases to which Mr Gartelmann has referred or the statistics (although I acknowledge that information of that kind, properly approached, can often be of value in determining whether a sentence is appropriate).  
32True it is that the sexual episode was exploitative in the manner which his Honour found.  Nevertheless, the features of the episode identified by Mr Gartelmann, particularly the victim's age, place the offence in the lower range of culpability of offences of its kind.  That being so, and having regard to the applicant's favourable prospects of rehabilitation, I am of the view that a sentence of 5 years, against a maximum of 10 years, is excessive.  Of course, the sentences for the other offences are all subsumed within it but, given that the four offences were component parts of a single brief episode, it was entirely appropriate that the other sentences be concurrent with it.  
33In my view, the appropriate sentence for count 3 is 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years and, in the circumstances, I consider that term sufficient to reflect the whole of her criminality.  That sentence would make her eligible for release on parole on 15 June 2013.  The sentence for count 4, 3 years with a non-parole period of 18 months, was not the subject of argument and I would not disturb it.  However, its accumulation upon the other sentences by 12 months would delay the applicant's eligibility for parole until 15 December 2013.  It is proper, in my view, to direct that that sentence commence 6 months earlier, that is, on 16 December 2011.  
34Accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal.  I would quash the sentences passed in the District Court for the third, fourth and fifth counts, and re-sentence the applicant as follows:
Count 3:  a non-parole period of 2 years, commencing on 16 June 2011 and expiring on 15 June 2013, and a balance of term of 2 years, commencing on 16 June 2013 and expiring on 15 June 2015.
Count 4:  a non-parole period of 18 months, commencing on 16 December 2011 and expiring on 15 June 2013, and a balance of term of 18 months, commencing on 16 June 2013 and expiring on 15 December 2014.
Count 5:  a non-parole period of 12 months, commencing on 16 June 2011 and expiring on 15 June 2012, and a balance of term of 12 months, commencing on 16 June 2012 and expiring on 15 June 2013.
Thus, the applicant would be eligible for release on parole on 15 June 2013, and the sentences would expire in their totality on 15 June 2015.
35BUTTON J:  I agree with Hidden J.

		18 April 2013",2013-04-17 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2706894,R v Bruce RUSSELL [2013] NSWDC 129,"Judgment



1HIS HONOUR: The accused is to be tried before a jury with respect to five counts of sexual assault of the complainant, HS. Each of the counts on the indictment is an offence under s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900. The accused's legal representatives have served a number of subpoenas in the proceedings including subpoenas on St Vincent's Hospital and the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. The schedule to each of those subpoenas on the hospitals seeks ""All documents and records in any way relating to [the complainant].""

2Although it was suggested during submissions that the subpoenas are too widely drawn, the hospitals did not object to the subpoenas, they did not seek to have the subpoenas set aside and indeed they have complied with the subpoenas in each case and produced the documents sought under the subpoena to the court. They are voluminous. The documents produced by St Vincent's Hospital comprise some six lever arch folders and the documents produced by the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, although not actually contained within lever arch folders, would probably take up another six such folders.

3When the trial was called on before me on Monday of this week Ms Hampel appeared on behalf of the complainant. With respect to the documents then produced by St Vincent's Hospital Ms Hampel informed me that a claim of sexual assault communication privilege under Div 2 of Pt 5 of Ch 6 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (the Act) was made with respect to each and every document produced. Ms Hampel informed me that she had not at that time inspected the documents produced by the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital and in fact at that time an access order had not been made, and I granted access only to Ms Hampel with respect to those documents.

4On that day Ms Hampel provided to me a document headed, ""St Vincent's Hospital Brief Summary Of Subpoena Material"". I noted that that document referred to there being within volume 2 of six volumes of the material produced by St Vincent's, documents relating to ""Left flank pain, regular admissions due to this."" And with respect to volume 5 of 6 there is again a reference in that document to ""Flank pain"" and further in relation to that volume there is also a reference to ""Hand injury"". I take that to mean that there were documents relating to a hand injury suffered by the complainant.

5The question arises whether when an alleged victim of sexual assault attends a hospital for treatment of some physical injury which is not related to an actual sexual assault, any communication made by the complainant to the hospital staff about that matter is privileged from production on the ground of sexual assault communication privilege.

6I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of his Honour Judge Berman SC in R v Markarian [2012] NSWDC 197 which was provided to me by Mr Skinner of counsel who now appears for the complainant.

7Judge Berman points out a number of difficulties in both the interpretation and practical implementation of the legislation relating to sexual assault communication privilege. Some of those problems were referred to by the Court of Criminal Appeal in KS v Veitch (No 2) [2012] NSWCCA 266, a decision that was delivered after Judge Berman delivered his judgment in Markarian. In Veitch (No 2), Basten JA said that the legislative provisions in relation to sexual assault communication privilege revolve around the concept of a ""protected confidence"" within the definition in s 296 of the Act. Section 296 defines a protected confidence as a ""counselling communication"" that is made by, to or about a victim or alleged victim of a sexual assault offence.

8A counselling communication is defined under s 296(4) as a communication:

(a) made in confidence by a person (the counselled person) to another person (the counsellor) who is counselling the person in relation to any harm the person may have suffered, or
(b) made in confidence to or about the counselled person by the counsellor in the course of that counselling, or
(c) made in confidence about the counselled person by a counsellor or a parent, carer or other supportive person who is present to facilitate communication between the counselled person and the counsellor or to otherwise further the counselling process, or
(d) made in confidence by or to the counsellor, by or to another counsellor, or by or to a person who is counselling or has at any time counselled the person.

9Section 296(4)(a), in defining a counselling communication, refers to a communication made in confidence by the counselled person to the counsellor who is counselling the person in relation to any harm the person may have suffered. The term ""harm"" is defined in s 295(1) to include:

actual physical bodily harm, financial loss, stress or shock, damage to reputation or emotional or psychological harm (such as shame, humiliation and fear).

10In Veitch (No 2), Basten JA said that it might be inferred from the fact that the person being counselled is the victim of an alleged sexual assault, that the harm referred to in s 296(4)(a) is the harm suffered by the person as a consequence of the alleged sexual assault. However, s 296(2) of the Act provides that a counselling communication is a protected confidence for the purposes of Div 2 even if it: 

(a) was made before the acts constituting the relevant sexual assault offence occurred or are alleged to have occurred, or
(b) was not made in connection with the sexual assault offence or alleged sexual assault offence, or any condition arising from the sexual assault offence or alleged sexual assault offence.

11Basten JA said, at para 18, that ""[t]he expansive provisions of s 296(2) tend to conflict with the definition of counselling communication in s 296(4)."" His Honour states that one explanation for the expansive interpretation is that Parliament wished to avoid the victim of a sexual assault being discouraged from reporting the offence if that course might result in revelation of any other disclosures made in counselling sessions, even if unrelated to the sexual assault. It is clear, however, that these statements by his Honour were obiter as his Honour accepted the expansive construction of s 296(2) for the purpose of testing a constitutional challenge to the provision.

12The operation of the privilege comes from s 298 of the Act which provides that:

(1) Except with the leave of the court, a person cannot seek to compel (whether by subpoena or any other procedure) any other person to produce a document recording a protected confidence in, or in connection with, any criminal proceedings.
(2) Except with the leave of the court, a document recording a protected confidence cannot be produced in, or in connection with, any criminal proceedings.
(3) Except with the leave of the court, evidence cannot be adduced in any criminal proceedings if it would disclose a protected confidence, or the contents of a document recording a protected confidence.

13There is no issue that the subpoenas directed to St Vincent's Hospital and the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital were issued without the leave of the court. However, in Veitch (No 2) Basten JA states, at para 29, that it is open to the trial court to disregard that irregularity and consider the documents in determining whether the parties should have access to them. That is an entirely reasonable approach because the tests for leave in issuing the subpoena are the same tests that apply when the court determines whether leave should be granted to the parties to have access to the documents.

14Section 299D(1) of the Act provides that:

""The court cannot grant an application for leave under this Division unless the court is satisfied that:
(a) the document or evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other documents or evidence produced or adduced or to be produced or adduced by the party seeking to produce or adduce the document or evidence, have substantial probative value, and 
(b) other documents or evidence concerning the matters to which the protected confidence relates are not available, and 
(c) the public interest in preserving the confidentiality of protected confidences and protecting the principal protected confider from harm, is substantially outweighed by the public interest in admitting into evidence information or the contents of a document of substantial probative value.


15Section 299D(2) provides as follows:

""Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account for the purposes of determining the public interest in preserving the confidentiality of protected confidences and protecting the principal protected confider from harm, the court must take into account the following: 
(a) the need to encourage victims of sexual offences to seek counselling,
(b) that the effectiveness of counselling is likely to be dependent on the maintenance of the confidentiality of the counselling relationship,
(c) the public interest in ensuring that victims of sexual offences receive effective counselling,
(d) that the disclosure of the protected confidence is likely to damage or undermine the relationship between the counsellor and the counselled person,
(e) whether disclosure of the protected confidence is sought on the basis of a discriminatory belief or bias, and
(f) that the adducing of the evidence is likely to infringe a reasonable expectation of privacy.

16Although not stated in express terms I would construe s 299D(2)(f) as referring to an infringement of a reasonable expectation of privacy as arising from counselling. That interpretation is consistent with the other provisions of s 299D(2).

17Section 299D(3) provides that:

For the purposes of determining an application for leave under this Division, the court may permit a confidential statement to be made to it by or on behalf of the principal protected confider by affidavit specifying the harm the confider is likely to suffer if the application for leave is granted.

18In these proceedings I have before me a confidential statement of the complainant that has been marked Exhibit B on the application.

19By way of background and in seeking to demonstrate a legitimate forensic purpose for the issue of the subpoenas on the hospitals, Mr Clarke of counsel who appears for the accused has referred me to the criminal record of the complainant and to a number of COPS event reports which were subpoenaed from the New South Wales Police.

20Before coming to those documents I should shortly state that the Crown case is that the accused was unknown to the complainant and that on the day of the alleged offences she saw him in the foyer of the building where she resided and that he travelled in the lift up to her floor. The complainant alleges that shortly after she entered her apartment the accused knocked on her door and that, when she opened the door, he pushed his way into her apartment and forcibly sexually assaulted her. 

21I am told by Mr Clarke that the defence case is that the accused was well known to the complainant and that they had had an ongoing relationship whereby the accused paid the complainant money for sex, usually in the sum of twenty dollars. The defence case is that the complainant only had consensual sex with the accused on the day of the alleged offences. However, on that day the accused had only ten dollars and he gave that money to the complainant and she appeared to be happy with that.

22The complainant's criminal record discloses that she has numerous convictions for maliciously set fire to buildings, attempted arson and public mischief. However, it appears that her last conviction for any offence was in 1997 for larceny as a bailee. That is some sixteen years ago. I should say that also recorded are a number of convictions for soliciting. The COPS event reports, which span the period November 2004 to February 2013, without going into detail, indicate the complainant has a serious and ongoing mental health history.

23Mr Clarke informs me that the complainant also has a history of making false reports about offences committed upon her, has a history of illicit drug use, is an arsonist, has made numerous self-harm attempts or threats, has reported auditory hallucinations in the past and has a history of effectively ""hospital shopping"". He submits that medical records from the hospitals may go towards establishing those matters.

24I have been provided with copies of all documents produced by St Vincent's Hospital and I have been provided with the original documents provided by the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital.

25Following discussions between Mr Skinner and Mr Clarke, Mr Skinner has marked with green and yellow tags all documents produced by those hospitals that may possibly be relevant to the defence case concerning the past history of the complainant to which I earlier referred. Mr Skinner, however, claims sexual assault communication privilege on behalf of the complainant with respect to each of those tagged documents. In written submissions Mr Skinner submits that the definition of ""protected confidence"" in s 296 of the Act is so wide as to capture all documents generated by a history given by the complainant to ambulance officers, nursing staff and doctors at the hospitals.

26I have now inspected all the documents produced by St Vincent's Hospital and the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital that have been tagged by Mr Skinner. Those documents fall within the following categories: ambulance patient healthcare records; hospital progress notes; mental health assessments; requests by ambulance officer for assessment of a mentally ill or mentally disturbed person; requests by a police officer for assessment; social worker reports; Emergency Department triage notes; Emergency Department clinical records; various forms under the Mental Health Act including a medical report as to the mental state of a detained person; a medical certificate as to examination or observation of a person and admission summary sheets.

27I have formed the view that many of the documents for which a claim of sexual assault communication privilege is made do not attract the privilege. Returning then to the provisions of Div 2 of the Act which, as I stated earlier, revolve around the concept of a ""protected confidence"" as defined in s 296 of the Act. A protected confidence means a ""counselling communication"" that is made by, to or about a victim or alleged victim of a sexual assault offence. Under s 296(4)(a) a ""counselling communication"" means a communication made in confidence by the counselled person to the counsellor who is counselling the person in relation to any harm the person may have suffered. A ""counselling communication"" also has an expanded meaning under s 296(4)(b), (c) and (d). However, s 296(5) provides:

For the purposes of the section, a person counsels another person if:
(a) the person has undertaken training or study or has experience that is relevant to the process of counselling persons who have suffered harm, and 
(b) the person:
(i) listens to and gives verbal or other support or encouragement to the other person, or
(ii) advises, gives therapy to or treats the other person,
whether or not for fee or reward.

28Therefore, for a person to counsel another person, it is first necessary that the counsellor has undertaken ""training or study or has experience that is relevant to the process of counselling persons who have suffered harm."" Neither the word ""counselling"" or the phrase ""process of counselling"" which are used in s 296(5)(a) are defined in the Act. The rule of statutory construction is that, subject to a contrary intention expressed in the legislation, general words should be given their plain and ordinary meaning. The words ""counsel,"" ""counselling,"" and the phrase ""counselling process"" have plain, everyday meanings. The Macquarie Concise Dictionary (4th Ed) defines the word ""counsel"" relevantly as, ""Advice, opinion or instruction given in directing the judgment or conduct of another."" Further, in determining the meaning of ""counsel"" and ""counselling"" and ""counselling process"" it is of assistance to have regard to the policy underlying this legislation. That policy was stated by the Attorney General in introducing certain amendments to the legislation in 2002. The Attorney General said:

The policy behind the sexual assault communications privilege is that the benefits of counselling services provided to a sexual assault victim should not be compromised by the prospect that communications made in connection with those services may later be revealed to the accused or disclosed in court. The Government has taken the view that the public interest in preserving the confidentiality of counselling communications, including counsellors' notes, in order to protect the counselling relationship and thereby assist the victim in overcoming the trauma of the attack often outweighs the public interest in allowing inspection of the notes by the accused or his or her lawyer.

29I should say, of course, that in the Second Reading speech the Attorney General appears to suggest that the privilege is confined to the counselling of a victim or alleged victim of sexual assault in relation to that sexual assault or alleged sexual assault. However, as I have indicated, these provisions have a much wider operation. The privilege would attach to protected confidences made by a person who is being counselled so long as the person is a victim of a sexual assault or alleged sexual assault. The counselling does not, in my view, under the plain terms of this legislation, have to relate to a sexual assault or harm that has been suffered as a result of a sexual assault or alleged sexual assault.

30A construction of the words ""counselling"", ""counsel"" and ""counselling process"" in conformity with their plain and ordinary meaning is consistent with the matters set out in s 299D(2) which the court must take into account in determining the public interest in preserving the confidentiality of protected confidences and protecting the principal protected confider from harm. 

31To attract sexual assault communication privilege, a communication by or about a victim of a sexual assault offence must be made in confidence by the counselled person to the person who is counselling the counselled person in relation to any harm the counselled person may have suffered, or in the circumstances as referred to in s 296(4)(b), (c) or (d). I will assume, for the purpose of this application, that all communications made by the complainant to the hospitals were confidential. As I said earlier, a confidential statement of her is before me. However, the issue, in my view, is whether the communications, the subject of the claim of privilege, were made to a counsellor.

32Section 296(5)(a) imposes a requirement that for a person to counsel another person the person must have ""undertaken training or study or has experience that is relevant to the process of counselling persons who have suffered harm"". In my view, it cannot be said that a communication made to an ambulance officer is a communication made to another person who is counselling the person in relation to any harm the person may have suffered. It is not the commonly understood role of ambulance officers to counsel persons. Further, in relation to the documents the subject of the subpoenas, there is no evidence that the relevant ambulance officers ""[have] undertaken training or study or [have] experience that is relevant to the process of counselling persons who have suffered harm"". However, such training, study or experience may be inferred in the case of hospital staff such as nurses, doctors and social workers, particularly when carrying out mental health assessments of patients.

33Further, many of the documents over which a claim of privilege is made are Emergency Department notes recording the symptoms or complaints made by the complainant with respect to purely physical ailments when she presented at the Emergency Department. Again, in my view, it cannot be said that a communication made by the complainant to a Triage nurse at an Emergency Department in describing her symptoms in relation to a purely physical complaint were made by the complainant to a ""counsellor"". I note that with respect to some of the Emergency Department records over which a claim of privilege is made the information was provided to the hospital not by the complainant but by the police or by ambulance officers.

34Accordingly, with unfeigned respect to Judge Berman, I am unable to agree with the conclusion he reaches at paragraoh 20 of His Honour's judgment in Markarian that s 296 of the Act is so widely drawn that it applies to treatment for any physical injury at a casualty department. Again, with greatest respect to His Honour, that conclusion overlooks the requirement in s 296(4) that to attract the privilege a communication must be made by the person to a person who is counselling the person or is made in the course of counselling. I am unable to see how the placing of a bandaid on a scratch at a casualty department (to use His Honour's example) could be described as counselling or being part of the process of counselling. Certainly the reporting of physical symptoms to a Triage nurse at an Emergency Department could not be categorised as counselling or being part of the process of counselling.

35Further, many of the documents over which a claim of privilege has been made do not contain a relevant communication as referred to in s 296(4) of the Act (either directly or inferentially) and therefore cannot attract the privilege.

36Claims of privilege are also made with respect to a number of requests by Police Officers that the complainant be mentally assessed. Clearly those documents contain no relevant communication and so the privilege could not attach to them. In relation to the documents over which a claim of privilege is made, I have placed blue tags on the documents in respect of which I uphold the claim of privilege. The next question that arises is whether leave should be granted under s 298(2) of the Act for any of the documents for which the claim of privilege is upheld to be produced to the parties. In determining whether to grant leave I must be satisfied of the matters referred to in s 299D(1)(a), (b) and (c), and with respect to s 299D(1)(c) I must take into account the matters in s 299D(2).

37After careful consideration I have determined that those privileged documents relating to the complainant's illicit drug use and auditory hallucinations do have substantial probative value with respect to her credit and in particular to her reliability. I am also satisfied, pursuant to s 299D(1)(b), that in relation to those matters other documents or evidence are not available. I am further satisfied, pursuant to s 299D(1)(c), that the public interest in preserving the confidentiality of protected confidences and protecting the principal confider from harm is substantially outweighed by the public interest in admitting into evidence information or the contents of a document of substantial probative value. In determining that matter I have taken into account the matters referred to in s 299D(2). 

38Doing the best I can, particularly in attempting to read handwriting often very difficult to decipher, I am unable to identify any document going to a history of the complainant of making false reports about offences committed upon her. Further, in my view documents relating to arson by or upon the complainant, self-harm attempts or threats and what might be described as ""hospital shopping"", do not have substantial probative value and accordingly leave should not be granted for access by the parties to those documents.

39To assist Mr Skinner I have marked with red tags all documents with respect to which I have upheld the claim of privilege but are documents with respect to which I grant leave for production to the parties. As I have said those documents fall into two categories, first, illicit drug use by the complainant and, secondly, complaints by the complainant of auditory hallucinations.

40I should make it clear that it is only with respect to the parts of the documents going to those issues that leave is granted. To avoid more time being taken up in redacting documents I would ask Mr Skinner to obtain instructions that only counsel, that is Mr Clarke and the Crown, are able to have access to the documents on the understanding that leave is only granted with respect to those parts of the documents going to the two issues I have referred to.

41Finally, the parties are to have access to all documents marked by Mr Skinner with a yellow green tag with respect to which I have not upheld a claim of privilege. In other words, those documents marked with a yellow or green tag but not marked with a blue tag.
 
 
[NB: In the course of delivering judgment the Crown informed the court that the Director of Public Prosecutions had directed that there be no further proceedings in the matter. By agreement between the parties the judgment was still delivered.]

		08 August 2013",2013-04-18 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2706896,R v Shelford [2013] NSWDC 102,"SENTENCE
1HIS HONOUR:  Today, I am sentencing Gavin Dean Shelford for offences involving child pornography.  The first offence is a State offence of possessing child abuse material.  The second offence is a Commonwealth offence of using a carriage service to transit child pornographic material, and when sentencing for that matter he asks that I take into account, on a schedule under s 16BA of the Commonwealth Crimes Act, an offence of using a carriage service to access child pornographic matter.  The offences are interrelated in that the carriage service was used to access all the child abuse material that was possessed.
2Child pornography is a worldwide problem.  The use of the internet means that geographic boundaries are largely irrelevant and so it was that in August 2011 the Australian Federal Police got information from police in The Netherlands about the use of an internet relay chat by a person with a user name ""Perverted Dad"".  In that chat Perverted Dad inferred that he was having a sexual relationship with his nine year old daughter.  Later investigations determined that the user of the name Perverted Dad was the offender.  It was also determined that what he was speaking about, a sexual relationship with his daughter, was pure fantasy.  Disgusting and degrading fantasy it was, but it was make believe.
3After getting the information from The Netherlands the Australian Federal Police went to the offender's premises on 8 March 2012.  They searched, of course, the computers and electronic equipment present at the location.  An initial examination revealed two images of child pornography.  The offender was shown those images and he declined to comment.  The material was seized and a forensic examination was conducted.  
4It is important to bear in mind that there is, in objective gravity terms, a significant difference between chatting and fantasising about sexually abusing children and possessing images and videos showing children being abused.  Of course, that is not to say that the former is not serious, of course it is.  But one of the most important matters in determining the objective gravity of an offence involving child pornography is whether children were harmed in the creation of that material.  If a person tells a story involving the sexual abuse of children and that is all that happens then no child is directly harmed.  That is not the case where images and videos of real children being abused are possessed.  
5The charge of possessing child pornographic material encompasses both forms of child pornography I have just mentioned, chats on the one hand and images and videos on the other.  This is because the chat blogs remained on the offender's computer at the time he was arrested.  They are simply disgusting.  What the offender describes is perverted and disturbing.  He is clearly engaged in sexually gratifying conduct with another person over the internet who also obtains sexual gratification from what is being described.  Other parts of the possession charge do relate to images and videos where real children were harmed.  I should interpolate here that two of the images were of a cartoon where equally no actual child was harmed.  
6When this matter was first before me on 1 March, Mr Shelford, the offender, gave evidence.  He admitted being responsible for the chats but gave evidence which he now admits is untrue as to many aspects of the images and videos.  On an earlier occasion he claimed that he had not himself downloaded and saved any of that material.  He said that it happened automatically as part of his involvement in the chat room.  He now agrees that that is not true.  He said on an earlier occasion that all he downloaded was material showing adult females masturbating, but he now admits that is not true as well because he downloaded images of girls as young as eight to ten or even younger masturbating.  
7He said on the earlier occasion that he did not have a sexual interest involving children.  He now agrees that is not true.  He said on an earlier occasion that he only downloaded material involving masturbation, but some of the other images and videos showed much more serious forms of abuse of children.  The offender now admits that he downloaded some of that as well.
8He gave evidence on the earlier occasion that at the time of his arrest he had been deleting material from the hard drive, something he has told his sister as well and she apparently believed it.  But that was not true either.    Very belatedly, Mr Shelford has decided to be honest with the Court and admit to the seriousness of what he did.  
9Because of the need to differentiate between pornography involving fantasies and pornography which involves harm, I will say the following.  There are 407 items covered by the possess child abuse material charge in categories 1 and 2 of the CETS classification.  About one-third of those were chats.  This means that a significant number of images and videos of children, each of whom would have been harmed, was in the possession of the offender.  
10When we moved to the more serious categories, 3, 4 and 5, there were 272 items.  The great bulk of those were chats, 216, so only fifty-four were images or videos of actual children.  
11When this offence is compared to other offences of this kind the difference in numbers is significant.  Some offenders, indeed most, possess thousands of images and videos, stored on various devices, sometimes catalogued.  And so in pure numerical terms the offender's criminality is not as serious as those other offences.  But that is not to say that the offender's conduct was not serious.  
12I have grown tired of reading out in remarks on sentence the awful descriptions of some of the images and videos found on child pornographers' computers.  Suffice to say, that in some instances the images and videos, which are the subject of this case, reveal high levels of abuse, high levels of harm and it is completely incomprehensible to any right thinking person how anyone could be sexually gratified by viewing items of that kind.  
13The offender is forty-six.  He has suffered from depression and what is described as an adjustment disorder for many years.  He suffered a tragedy of losing his mother in circumstances where he was the one who discovered her dead body.  He has experienced marital separation and, as part of the consequences of that, losing contact with his only child.  His father is in a nursing home and his stepmother has been recently diagnosed with cancer.  The offender said that in those circumstances he turned to alcohol and whilst intoxicated he turned to chat rooms which led to him committing these offences.  
14Since being arrested he has taken steps to ensure that he will not reoffend.  He has disconnected the internet and there is no alcohol in his home.  His sister, who lives with him, helps by making sure that he follows those self-imposed rules.  He is seeing a psychiatrist, Dr Mendez, and understands the need to be treated in order to avoid slipping back into the way he was leading up to his arrest.   
15These offences occurred over a significant period of time, his transmission offence between April 2010 and February 2012 and the access offence between August 2010 and March 2012.  For many months, therefore, the offender was doing something he knew was wrong and doing something he knew was causing harm and yet he continued.   
16Another aspect of the offender's mental state is this.  Of reasonably recent times he says that he has recovered a memory of being sexually assaulted.  It seems quite likely that he was.  The two men who he says sexually assaulted him were, it seems, well known within Mr Shelford's family of being the type of people who would sexually abuse many children within the family.  The circumstances in which a person can recover memory, even events such as this was, are not well known and not fully accepted.  I do not need to make a decision as to whether Mr Shelford really was sexually abused as he said he was, but I am satisfied that he believes that he was and that that has had a significant impact upon him, as might be expected.  
17I mentioned the illnesses or the positions involving his father and stepmother.  He provides his stepmother with assistance and visits his father one day a week, taking him out of the nursing home to give him an excursion on a regular basis.  Mr Williams did not suggest the hardship that would be experienced by the offender's stepmother or his father as a result of the offender's incarceration was exceptional.  I thus cannot take it into account, except as part of a general mix of subjective factors that I will consider.  
18The offender pleaded guilty at an early stage and so I will acknowledge his willingness to facilitate the course of justice in the Commonwealth matter and the utilitarian benefit of his plea of guilty in the State matter by imposing ultimately sentences which are twenty-five per cent less than they would otherwise have been.  On top of that, I am now prepared to accept the offender was remorseful.  That was a finding I was not going to make until the offender gave evidence today admitting that he had lied and, thus, for what seems to have been about the first time, really accepting responsibility for his wrongdoing.  
19I should make it clear in the offender's favour is that this change of heart did not come about because he became aware that the Prosecution had conducted a further forensic examination of his computer and could prove that what he said was untrue.  No suggestion was made to Mr Shelford before he changed his mind and decided to tell the truth in the witness box.  
20Mr Williams sought a non-custodial sentence but as a fallback position suggested that I would impose sentences of such a length that an intensive corrections order would be an available option.  The Crown, recognising that there is no one sentence which is the correct one in any particular case, says that the offender should receive a sentence of full-time custody but acknowledges that an ICO is in the range of appropriate sentences.  
21Were it not for the offender's evidence today in which he told the truth I would have sent him to gaol.  I simply did not believe what he said on the earlier occasion and was prepared to reject it beyond reasonable doubt.  In circumstances where the offender needed to have demonstrated to him the wrongfulness of his actions because he did not seem to accept how wrong they were, I would have imposed a sentence of full-time custody without giving any consideration of the possibility of there being an intensive corrections order.  
22I am prepared, however, to make orders which may see the offender serving a sentence by way of an intensive corrections order.  A custodial sentence of some kind is required.  Even the fantasy stories contained within the chat logs are sufficiently serious, involving interactions with other perverted people throughout the world, that a custodial sentence of some kind is required for them.  Possessing child pornographic material, especially possessing images and videos, having children harmed, some significantly, must also in this case be met with a custodial sentence of some form.  
23Having made that decision and having decided that the length of the sentences will be such that an ICO is an option, I have decided to adjourn the matter so that Mr Shelford can be assessed as to his suitability of serving his sentence by way of an intensive corrections order.  
24I will adjourn the matter to two o'clock on 7 June and continue Mr Shelford's bail until then and order that there be an ICO assessment performed upon him.  
25ADJOURNED TO 7 JUNE 2013 AT 2PM FOR SENTENCE

2706903,R v Abdollahi [2013] NSWSC 428,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: Mr Ali Abdollahi (""the offender"") is to be sentenced for an offence of affray that was committed within the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre (""Villawood"") on 20 April 2011.

2Affray is an offence contrary to s 93C of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 10 years.

3I will first say something about how the offender came to be at Villawood.

4He was born in Iraq in 1975 and so he is now aged 37. He was an only child. His mother died when he was aged 2 and his father died when he was aged 14. His grandmother cared for him from that point. 

5The Faili Kurds, who were in the minority Shi'a community were forced by the regime of Saddam Hussein to leave Iraq and so the offender came to live in the Ilam province of Iran at about the age of 5. He had no identity documents and was denied access to formal schooling. He worked as a shepherd from about the age of 13.

6He has a wife and a son who is now aged 6. He met his wife in 2003 when he was living in Abhar with his grandmother. Abhar is said to be a small village of about 300 or 400 people in a farming community in western Iran. 

7After their marriage the couple lived in Abhar for a time but moved to Pakal in 2004 to live with his wife's father and her younger brother and sister. His wife gave evidence that this is a remote place that is inaccessible by motor vehicle and she said that they all lived together in a tent. The offender worked with farm animals as a shepherd along with his father-in-law and they had a very close relationship.

8The offender claimed that he was subjected to persecution in Iran. On one occasion he was interrogated about not having identity documentation; he was detained in police custody, assaulted, suffered a fractured arm and lost some teeth. He became wary of travelling to urban areas and claimed to have felt increasingly fearful and depressed in the years that followed. He planned to leave Iran and in this he was supported and encouraged by his wife and father-in-law.

9In 2009 the offender left Iran to come to Australia, leaving his wife and son behind. He arrived as an ""irregular maritime arrival"" on 26 November 2009 and was detained pursuant to the Migration Act 1958 (Cth). He spent some time on Christmas Island and was assessed as to his refugee status. It was determined in March 2010 that he was not a genuine refugee. He sought an Independent Merits Review but failed in that process in July 2010. He was transferred to Villawood in August 2010. 

10A second Independent Merits Review was conducted in February 2011 and he was awaiting its outcome at the time of the offence.

11There are three compounds within Villawood. The offender was housed in the Macquarie Building in the Fowler Compound. Staffing at Villawood had been contracted out by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (""DIAC"") to a company called Serco. There were 158 detainees within Fowler on 20 April 2011.

12In September 2010, a Fijian man detained at VIDC committed suicide in an adjoining compound by jumping from a balcony. There are notes within the offender's medical records that indicate that he was saddened, stressed and depressed as a result of this incident. Apparently he was a witness to the event. A psychological report resulting from an assessment of the offender in October 2010 indicates that he was particularly distressed and, at the time of that assessment, was ""preoccupied by flashbacks of the scene of the man diving to the ground, the blood which surrounded him on the ground and also the way his body trembled until he died"". The psychologist wrote, ""These images tormented Mr Abdollahi and, shaking his head, he repeatedly said, 'he must have really suffered, he must have really been scared to return home to do this'"".

13The psychologist, Dr Shakeh Momartin, described at some length the anguish and desperation the offender reported feeling about his prolonged detention and the uncertainty and fear he had about the prospect of deportation. She wrote:

Mr Abdollahi's current environment is not facilitating his feelings of safety and security, and as a result, his anxiety and depressive features have exacerbated. Almost ten months of being detained without an outcome, has placed a strain on his psychological and mental state. Further delay in receiving a response to his appeal for protection, with the accompanying uncertainty related to its outcome, will gradually lead to exhaustion and slowly deplete his coping resources placing him at high risk of serious mental and physical deterioration.

14Subsequent to that psychological assessment, the offender also had the experience of another detainee hanging himself in the shower block.

15There are notes in the medical file dated 19 April 2011 that record that the offender was having issues with ""his deteriorating mental health"". There were concerns expressed about him appearing ""emotional, a little erratic and was not making much sense""; also, that he was ""feeling depressed and having trouble controlling his emotions"". It is said that he had seen people suicide and otherwise hurt themselves and he kept thinking about these incidents. He wanted to see a psychologist as soon as possible.

16Another note in the medical records made mid-morning on 20 April 2011 is that the offender was ""extremely upset and distressed by [the] circumstances in Fowler"". That is likely to be a reference to a protest that had commenced when two detainees, Mehdi Darabi and Amir Morad Mansoor, were seen on the roof of the Macquarie Building early in the morning. Thereafter they were seen to engage in various activities which included abusing Serco staff and throwing roof tiles. 

17During the course of the morning the offender spoke with one of the Serco staff. He said to her, ""You can't help us. I will be on the roof by the end of the day"". In cross-examination she agreed that he also spoke of seeing ""too many bodies on the floor"". Another officer who was present recalled that he said, ""You need to get DIAC to come and see me"", ""Can you get DIAC? I'm going crazy. I have been here 20 months. You need to help me"". He was pointing to his head as he said this. He also said something like, ""I'll climb on the roof"".

18The offender subsequently consulted a psychologist around the middle of the day. This would have entailed him leaving the Fowler Compound and going to the medical centre elsewhere within Villawood. The medical records include a note, ""No risk issues identified at this stage"". 

19Back in the Fowler Compound, the activities officer tried to commence a game of soccer in the early afternoon. However, according to his evidence, Darabi and Mansoor ""seemed to get upset"" and told him not to play soccer because they were ""making a point by being on the roof"". They threw roof tiles in his direction. A detainee, Mahmood Dadash, approached and yelled out that the officer should ""fuck off"" and ""get out of here"". 

20The officer went to the far end of the soccer field where he again attempted to start the game. Mr Dadash approached once more; he was aggressive and, the officer said, ""in my face"". He said, ""I told you not to play here"" and to ""fuck off"". He tried to grab the soccer ball. 

21At this stage the offender came on to the soccer field. He was yelling and swearing, saying something like ""fuck off"". When he got closer to the activities officer, maybe two metres away, he tried to throw a punch to his head but missed. The officer described this as ""very threatening"" and tried to shield himself. He said there were maybe 20 or 30 other detainees who had accompanied the offender to the field. Other witnesses spoke of a smaller number. The difference is immaterial. Some of them tried to hold the offender back or get in-between him and the officer. But the offender persisted in throwing punches, all of which missed. The officer said that he must have tried to swing punches about three times. Another detainee grabbed the soccer ball and kicked it out of the compound. The detainees then dispersed. 

22The protest in the Fowler Compound continued throughout the rest of the day and into the night.

23At about 5.30pm the offender had a conversation by telephone with his wife. She informed him that her father had passed away a few days earlier. She said that the offender became very upset. That is unsurprising, particularly given the close relationship he had enjoyed with his father-in-law.

24More detainees joined Mansoor and Darabi on the roof of the Macquarie Building in the early evening. They included the offender. He claims to have been coerced by other detainees but, given his statements earlier in the day, I doubt it. At one point he was seen to have a bed sheet tied around his neck and some witnesses suggested that he appeared as if he was intending to commit suicide. One member of staff, however, said that she thought it appeared theatrical. That opinion cannot be lightly dismissed because a number of witnesses spoke of the offender having one end of the sheet around his neck while holding the other end up in the air. One witness said that he heard the offender screaming out that he ""wanted to see DIAC, but if he did not see DIAC he would throw himself and kill himself"". He was also asking to be provided with cigarettes.

25That the offender was seriously intending to commit suicide is doubtful. It seems more likely that he was threatening to do so without any intention of carrying out the threat. This was probably out of desperation, partly related to the issues concerning his detention and partly because of the distressing news he had heard from his wife earlier that evening.

26The situation in the compound deteriorated dramatically at about 11.00pm. The events during the mid to late evening comprised the Crown's case on riot for various accused in the trial but the offender was acquitted in respect of his alleged involvement. 

27The only event that is relevant to the sentencing of the offender is his confrontation with the activities officer. It cannot be ignored, however, that it was in the context of a developing protest within the compound that involved abusive and threatening behaviour by other detainees towards Serco staff. Section 93C(2) of the Crimes Act provides that if two or more people use or threaten unlawful violence, it is the conduct of them taken together that must be considered. As a result, it is appropriate that the behaviour of Mr Darabi, Mr Mansoor and Mr Dadash in threatening violence towards the activities officer be taken into account in assessing the degree to which a person present at the time would have been put in fear.

28In the infinite circumstances in which an offence of affray can be committed, the actual physical activity involved in this example is of a lower order of seriousness. However, taking into account the context in which it occurred, particularly that it was in the course of a protest in which public officials simply carrying out their employment were physically and verbally threatened, it is more serious than that, even accepting that it was likely a spontaneous reaction to events on the offender's part.

29The rooftop protest on the Macquarie Building continued for quite some days. The offender came down the following evening. The medical records include that he said that the news of his father-in-law's passing away was the ""main precipitating factor for him climbing on the roof and threatening to kill himself"". It is also recorded that he had no further thoughts of self-harming.

30In a subsequent conversation with his wife he said, ""I was really affected by the news that you said about your father and I was very upset for you, and also I was disappointed by the Immigration and I didn't know what to do so I just wanted to kill myself"".

31Given that he had been in detention for almost 18 months, it is unsurprising that the offender might have felt distressed about the length of time the assessment of his refugee status was taking, particularly as his future was uncertain and he had been separated from his wife and son for so long. Ironically, it was on 21 April 2011 that he was informed that a determination had been made that he was a genuine refugee. The following month he received a favourable security clearance by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. 

32The offender's wife bought a false passport and left Iran to come to Australia on 30 April 2011. She and their son were initially held in immigration detention. They were released into community detention in November 2011, and in February 2012 were granted protection visas. They now live in a suburb of Sydney and are able to visit the offender at Villawood. Moreover, he has been permitted to leave the detention centre in order to visit them at their home.

33Dr Richard Furst, forensic psychiatrist, assessed the offender in December 2012. His report sets out a history that is generally to the effect that the offender has been feeling increasingly anxious and depressed throughout his time in immigration detention. Dr Furst diagnosed the offender as suffering from Major Depressive Disorder and Generalised Anxiety Disorder. A useful summary appears in the following extract from Dr Furst's report:

The history obtained from Mr Abdollahi and a review of his extensive psychological reports from STARTTS [NSW Service for the Treatment and Rehabilitation of Torture and Trauma Survivors] suggest that [the offender] presents with a history of persistent and severe depression, insomnia, hopelessness, marked anxiety about his family's welfare and his own immigration and legal status, and some re-experiencing phenomena relating to the deaths of other detainees at the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre.

...

In my opinion, his judgment may well have been affected by his severe depression and the high levels of anxiety he was experiencing in April 2011. He was probably vulnerable to the influence of his peers and alleged co-offenders.

...

[D]epression, anxiety and desperation often make it more difficult for people to think clearly about the consequences of their actions.

34Under the heading ""Prognosis"" he wrote:

Mr Abdollahi has a severe depressive illness and comorbid anxiety disorder. He has very limited community supports in Australia and is fearful of persecution [if] he returns to Iran. He remains very worried about his family. His condition will require ongoing input from a psychiatrist and a psychologist.

35Dr Furst proposed a treatment plan that entails psychiatric care; engagement with psychological, vocational, educational or social activities; and medication.

36A problem with the opinions expressed by Dr Furst is that it seems he was unaware that the offender's wife came to Australia two years ago and that she and their son are now permanent residents. Under the heading ""Recent Progress"" he wrote:

Mr Abdollahi said that his mental health has gone from bad to worse over the last 20 months and that he feels ""like a broken man"". He has not seen his family for the last three years, feels highly stressed, and feels as though ""time is against him"". (Emphasis added)

37In a report by a psychologist concerning the offender's wife dated 27 May 2012, it is said that she and her son visit the offender every week. I note that the psychologist identified signs of her experiencing signs of severe anxiety and depression as well. 

38Despite the error in the history upon which Dr Furst formulated his opinions and diagnoses, I am inclined to accept them. It is the fact of detention, and its length and circumstances, together with uncertainty as to the future that seem to be the more significant matters contributing to the offender's mental condition. I note also that no submission was made that I should not act upon Dr Furst's report which was tendered without objection and without any request that he attend for cross-examination.

39The most recent psychological assessment of the offender is dated 6 March 2013 and relates to an assessment made of him the previous month. It included that his ""emotional and psychological state appears to be very fragile"". The psychologist was concerned that his ""coping resources seem to be gradually deteriorating"" and ""he is at an increased risk of self harm, and he might attempt to commit suicide if his coping mechanisms are exhausted"". He believed that the offender's mental health ""should be closely monitored due to the helplessness and despair"" that he was then feeling.

Pre-sentence custody

40The offender was removed to the Metropolitan Reception and Remand Centre at Silverwater on 22 April 2011 because of his involvement in the events of 20 April 2011. He had not been charged; this was simply a transfer of his place of immigration detention. I note that when he was assessed by a mental health nurse on 24 April 2011 he was found to be exhibiting signs of depression and despair and was considered to be at risk of suicide.

41He was then transferred to a detention centre in Melbourne on 12 May 2011. He was arrested and charged on 6 July 2011 and remained in custody, bail refused, until 17 January 2012 when he was released on bail and returned to Villawood.

42The offender has been considered as a candidate for community detention under the Migration Act but in December 2012 the Minister determined that this should be declined. An earlier consideration of community detention failed because he was assessed as not meeting ""the guidelines"".

43Mr Smith submitted that I should take into account all of the time since 22 April 2011 as pre-sentence custody, whether the offender was in gaol or in immigration detention. I have considered that submission but do not accept it. Whether the offender might have been released to community detention at some stage is possible but the evidence is insufficient to found a definitive conclusion. I do, however, intend to take into account that the fact that criminal proceedings were pending has delayed the resolution of the offender's immigration status.

Sentencing of others

44I sentenced Mahmood Dadash on 7 December 2012: R v Dadash [2012] NSWSC 1511. I sentenced Mehdi Darabi, Amir Morad Mansoor and Mehdi Agha Razai on 5 April 2013: R v Darabi, Mansoor & Razai [2013] NSWSC 387. Saied Chenarjaafarizad was sentenced on 17 April 2013: R v Chenarjaafarizad [2013] NSWSC 388. Each of those offenders had pleaded guilty to affray.

45I have taken into account the objective gravity of the offences committed by them as well as the various ameliorating subjective circumstances as reflected in those sentencing judgments.

Assessment of sentence

46Mr Smith has submitted that I should deal with the matter under either s 10(1)(a) or (b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) and has reminded me that in doing so I need to have regard to each of the matters in s 10(3). The Crown Prosecutor, on the other hand, with reference to s 5(1), has submitted that no sentence other than imprisonment is appropriate.

47The offence committed by the present offender is unique in the sense that it was a discrete event that occurred well after the protest had started but well before the serious mayhem erupted within the Fowler Compound. I accept that the offender could not have been aware at 2.00pm on the day in question that the protest would disintegrate in the way it did after nightfall. Those events are irrelevant to the assessment of sentence in his case.

48The offence committed by the offender is substantially different in form and context to those that were committed by the offenders I have already sentenced and those who were found guilty at trial and remain to be sentenced. It was very brief in duration. To a significant extent it was a product of the offender's mental state that I have endeavoured to describe in detail earlier in these sentencing remarks. His moral culpability must be regarded as considerably less than it otherwise might have been. One of the various significant differences between his offence and those of others is that his actions cannot be considered to have had any influence upon others who engaged in using or threatening unlawful violence. After the soccer game incident, nothing much happened in the compound for quite some hours. It is a concern that the offence involved threatening violence to a Serco employee who was simply carrying out his duties. Notwithstanding that, in the end I am of the view that the offence, while not trivial, is at the lower end of the spectrum of seriousness.

49I have had regard to the fact that the offender has spent some seven months in gaol, most of which was as a result of being charged. I have had regard to the fact that, notwithstanding the assessment being made that the offender is a genuine refugee, his claim for asylum has likely been delayed on account of there being pending criminal proceedings against him. In part that has been because he pleaded not guilty but it has also been because he was also charged with riot, of which the jury found him not guilty. He has now been in detention, in one form or another, for almost three and a half years in circumstances in which he has experienced a significant deterioration in his mental health; a situation that appears to have continued until the present. The fact that a charge of this nature, of this level of objective seriousness, would often be dealt with summarily and more expeditiously in the Local Court is a relevant factor as well.

50The Crown Prosecutor submitted that there was an absence of remorse. I accept that submission. This simply means that a potentially mitigating factor is absent.

51Other matters relevant to the assessment of sentence include that he is a person of prior good character with no previous convictions. With resolution of his immigration status being no longer held up by the existence of criminal proceedings, it would seem that his rehabilitation prospects are good and that he would be unlikely to re-offend.

Sentence

52In respect of the charge of affray for which the offender was found guilty by the jury I discharge him on condition that he enter into a good behaviour bond pursuant to s 10(1)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (NSW) for a period of 12 months. It is a condition of the bond that he is to notify the Registrar of the Court of any change in his residential address within 7 days of such change. 

53I confirm that in making this order I have had regard to each of the matters in s 10(3) and also that I have determined pursuant to s 10(2) that it is expedient to do so.

2706910,In the matter of ACN 067 436 024 Pty Limited (in liquidation) [2013] NSWSC 422,"Judgment

1By interlocutory application filed on 7 March 2013, the applicant, Mr Nicholas Crouch (""Liquidator"") as liquidator of ACN 067 436 024 Pty Limited (in liq) (""Company"") seeks orders under, inter alia, ss 596F and 597 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) that orders 1, 2, 4 and 5 dated 21 October 2011 (""21 October orders"") be vacated; the Liquidator be relieved from any expressed or implied terms of confidentiality pursuant to those orders and, to the extent necessary, he be released from any implied undertaking concerning the use of two records of examination of Messrs McCarthy and Seller and/or documents produced in respect of orders for production in the proceedings for the purpose of considering and, if he sees fit, causing the company to commence proceedings in respect of its investment in what is described as the ""whisky scheme"". The Liquidator did not press for orders in that form today, but has indicated that he will do so if unsuccessful in obtaining alternative orders in the form put before the Court in two versions today. 

2By way of background to the 21 October orders, the application made on 7 March 2013, and the alternative form of orders now put before the Court, Messrs McCarthy and Seller are each subject to criminal proceedings in respect of the whisky scheme. The Court issued summonses for examination of Messrs McCarthy and Seller in September 2011. The examinations ultimately proceeded after a regime was established, with the Liquidator's consent, of confidentiality and non-publication directions. In particular, paragraphs 1-2 and 4-5 of the 21 October orders, which are now sought to be replaced, relevantly provided that the examinations of Messrs McCarthy and Seller conducted under ss 596B and 597 of the Corporations Act be held in private; paragraph 4 restricted access to the transcripts or written records of the examinations to specified persons; and paragraph 5 restricted publication or communication of the information about the examinations, including the questions asked and answers given. 

3Those orders broadly corresponded to the orders made by Ward J in Re Kassem (as liquidators of Clarecastle Pty Ltd) [2011] NSWSC 490 which also related to the ""whisky scheme"". In that case her Honour had pointed to the public purpose served by the examination regime on the one hand, and had also considered the interaction between pending criminal proceedings and a liquidator's examination, referring to the decision of the High Court in Hamilton v Oades [1989] HCA 21; (1989) 166 CLR 486, and to the recognition of the need to balance justice between the parties in McMahon v Gould (1982) 7 ACLR 202 at 206 - 207, and the further consideration of those issues in Global Finance Group Pty Ltd (in liq) v Margaria [2001] WASC 50 (at [15]). Her Honour had concluded in Re Kassem (as liquidators of Clarecastle Pty Ltd) above at [63]: 

""Provided that safeguards can be put in place to protect the position of the examinees in the subsequent criminal proceedings (by directing that the examinations be held in private and imposing restrictions on access to the transcript), I am of the view there is not sufficient prejudice likely to be suffered by the examinees being required to prepare for and attend public examinations to outweigh the public interest in the liquidators being able to perform their obligations in the winding up and to ascertain for the benefit of creditors what occurred in relation to the Scotch Whisky Scheme without further delay."" 

Her Honour there made orders for the examinations to be made in private and ""to put in place a regime that would maintain the ability of the Court to preclude access of the transcripts of the examinations until after the conclusion of the hearing in the criminal proceedings and then subject to any further order of the Court"" (at [87]). The parties consented to similar, but not identical, orders before the Registrar in these proceedings, which permitted access to the transcripts of examination (no authenticated written record of the examinations having been required) to say specified class of persons subject to a confidentiality regime. 

4The evidence indicates that the Liquidator is now considering issuing proceedings against Mr Seller, Australian Spirit Management Pty Limited and a legal firm of which Mr Seller was at one time a partner for recovery of moneys invested in the whisky scheme. The Liquidator indicates that he seeks to rely on the information obtained in the examinations to commence those proceedings and would, in all likelihood, serve the examination transcripts in support of the claim upon the proposed defendant. 

5A difficulty arises, however, because Messrs McCarthy and Seller are still subject to the criminal proceedings, to which I referred above, which were recognised by the imposition of the orders to which I have also referred. Those proceedings were permanently stayed by a judge of this Court on 17 August 2012; the Court of Appeal subsequently allowed an appeal against that decision on 1 March 2013, permitting the criminal proceedings to proceed; and, although Messrs McCarthy and Seller have filed an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court against that decision, the matter should presently be approached on the basis that the criminal proceedings are pending. 

6I have set out the background to these matters at some length, because they remain relevant notwithstanding the proposed further orders that were put before the Court following the original interlocutory application. It appears the parties, or at least the Liquidator and Mr McCarthy, have reached a degree of agreement as to one form of orders and seek to have those orders made subject to certain issues as to their efficacy being resolved. It appears from submissions that Mr Seller adopts Mr McCarthy's position in that regard although Mr Seller did not appear in this application. There remains however, a wider issue as to whether the issues sought, whether in the form of the ""consent"" orders or in the alternative form proffered by the Liquidator, may properly be made by the Court. 
7I should say something further, at this point, as to the Liquidator's position in this application. In written submissions, the Liquidator indicated that he had agreed to the orders proposed by Messrs McCarthy and Seller, subject to the restrictions the orders sought to impose on persons not parties to the application. That is true in one sense, in that it appears that Mr McCarthy has proposed a form of order in response to the Liquidator's original application; nonetheless, it should be recognised that the Liquidator is the party who seeks the amendment to the previous orders and need to establish to the Court's satisfaction that that amendment should be made. The Liquidator is not a respondent to an application made by Mr McCarthy to have his own examination transcript released to third parties. The Liquidator has, as I have noted, in turn advanced an alternate set of orders if the Court is not prepared to make the order agreed with Mr McCarthy and has, as I have noted before, also reserved the right to pursue the interlocutory application if neither the consent orders nor the alternative orders were made. 

8The first order sought in the consent orders is the two persons, Mr Peter Brent and Ms Mary Ann Brent (""the Brents"") be joined as applicants. It appears that the Brents were directors of the Company before it was placed in liquidation by a creditors' voluntary resolution in March 2011; the Liquidators submit that they personally invested money in the whisky scheme in 1999 of a substantial amount in addition to the Company making an investment in the scheme; the shareholder of the Company was another entity controlled by the Brents; and, the Liquidator contends, the Brents intend to be joined as co-plaintiffs in the proposed proceedings, presumably on the basis that the Liquidator sees no difficulty with himself and creditors or contributories of the Company being represented by the same solicitors in those proceedings. The amendments now sought to the 21 October orders would permit the Brents access to the examination transcripts and documents produced by Messrs Seller and McCarthy.

9There it seems to me a difficulty with the first order sought. That difficulty is that Mr and Mrs Brent do not, in fact, bring any application before me, although Mr Stevens, who appears for the Liquidator, points out that, on his instructions, they consent to the Liquidator's application. I would be reluctant to grant leave for persons to be joined as applicants, where they do not, in fact, bring an application. I would also be reluctant to make that order, in the absence of those sought to be joined as applicants, where it is unclear whether they recognise that the consequence of being joined as an applicant in the proceedings is that they would be exposed to liability for costs of the application if it is unsuccessful. So far as the Brents seek to be joined as applicants, then it is preferable that they first identify the application that they make, and that it be clear that they accept the potential liability for costs from being joined in the application. I will not make an order in the form of the first order, in the Brents' absence and without clarity as to those matters. 

10The second order sought is amendments to paragraphs 4 and 5 of the 21 October orders. The proposed amendments to orders 4 and 5 are complex, but, in broader terms, seem to have the consequence, first, that any future leave of the Court for access to records of the examinations under s 596(1)(e) of the Corporations Act may be given in these proceedings or in future civil proceedings which may be commenced by the company against specified persons (""proposed proceedings""). It is plain enough that an application for such leave may be made in these proceedings and no further order is required to achieve that result. It does not seem to me that I should determine whether such an application should be made in the proposed proceedings which is a matter better left for determination, if the proposed proceedings are commenced, by the judicial officer dealing with them. 

11The second amendment sought in respect of order 4 is that the range of persons who may have access to the transcripts of examinations of Messrs McCarthy and Seller would be extended to the Brents and ""named defendants in the proposed proceedings"" who have been notified of the directions and their respective legal advisers. (I note there is no definition of the term ""named defendants in the proposed proceedings"", but that is a matter which could be addressed by a minor amendment). The amendment sought to paragraph 5 of the 21 October orders seeks an order under s 596(1)(f) of the Corporations Act that the Brents, and each of the named defendants to the proposed proceedings who have been notified of the directions, must not publish or communicate to any person other than their respective legal advisers (or after giving notice of the terms of the directions) the named defendants in the proposed proceedings. There is a degree of complexity in this provision, not least because the named defendants appear in it twice, both as persons subject to the restraint and as persons to whom communication may be made on condition.

12The combined effect of the amendment to orders 4 and 5 seem to be to extend access to the transcripts of the examinations to the Brents and the named defendants in the proposed proceedings and to impose restrictions on publication and communication on those persons although they are not party to the present proceedings. The Liquidator identifies, but does not make substantive submissions about, an issue whether the Court has power to, or should, make orders restricting publication and communication binding on third parties who are not before the Court. Mr Bruckner, who appears for Mr McCarthy, makes substantive submissions as to that issue, and submits that the Court has power under s 596F of the Corporations Act, its inherent jurisdiction and s 90 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW), in granting access to documents of non-parties to make orders that those non-parties, not to disclose the relevant material. Mr Bruckner also refers to the Court's power to make confidentiality and non-publication orders under the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW). Mr Bruckner submits that the Court would exercise its discretion to impose such conditions and makes clear that Mr McCarthy does not consent to disclosure that is not conditioned on such confidentiality and such non-publication orders. He points to the recognition of the rights of persons facing prosecution in this regard in matters addressed in Hamilton v Oades and in Clarecastle, to which I have referred above. 

13I do not find it necessary to address the Court's power to make non-publication orders binding on third parties because it seems to me this application can and should be decided on a significantly narrower basis. It would be open to the Brents, Australian Spirit Management or the law firm that is a proposed defendant to the proposed proceedings to apply, by interlocutory process, whether individually or in conjunction with the Liquidator, for access to the relevant transcripts, and offer confidentiality undertakings to the Court in order to address any concerns as to maintaining the confidentiality and use of the documents. Here, it is implicit in the Liquidator's application that the Brents seek such access, although they have made no such offer of such an undertaking. There is evidence that Australian Spirit Management neither consents to nor opposes the application, so it appears that it does not itself seek such a transcript, and it offers no such undertaking. There is no evidence as to the attitude of the law firm as to whether access is sought and it, not having made its position clear, it also offers no such undertaking. 

14So far as the Brents are concerned, I can see no reason why the Court should exercise a discretion to grant such access, or make orders for confidentiality seeking to bind them as third parties, where they have not themselves applied for such access or offered an undertaking as to confidentiality so as to assist in addressing the issue that would otherwise arise from unrestricted publication of the transcript. In particular, I see no reason why the Court should engage with complex issues as to its ability to make orders binding upon third parties, where an identified person seeking such access could readily offer an undertaking to bring certainty to the position. So far as Australian Spirit Management and the law firm are concerned, I could see no reason to grant access to transcripts to persons who do not seek it. If these persons seek access to the transcripts, they too can make an appropriate application to the Court, and consider whether to offer a confidentiality undertaking to the Court in a form which would avoid the potential difficulties in respect of orders made against third parties in their absence. 

15The third order sought seeks leave for the Liquidator, the Brents, and each of the named defendants in the proposed proceedings who have been notified of orders 4 and 5 of the 21 October orders, the orders made today and any further leave granted under orders 4 and 5 to use the transcripts or other written record of the examination to decide whether to commence the proposed proceedings, to prepare any final pleadings or ""otherwise negotiate a settlement of the proceeding"". I do not consider the first part of this order is necessary since the orders previously made by the Court do not prevent the Liquidators using the transcripts to prepare the proposed proceedings: compare Re Southern Equity Corporation Limited (in liq); Bond and Cobache v England (1997) 25 ACSR 394 at 397. I do not consider I should make the second part of the order, because it is unclear what is intended to be comprised by use of the transcript to negotiate a settlement. In particular, it is unclear whether an order in that form would permit a disclosure of the content of the transcript, if that were made for the purposes of negotiating a settlement, to persons who are otherwise not parties to any subject confidentiality regime in a manner which to date has not been permitted. Order 4 appears as a derivative of order 3 and does not arise where I have not made order 3. 

16Order 5 deals with the implied undertaking and seeks to vary it to reflect the amended orders 4 and 5 of the 21 October orders. It is not necessary to make it since I have not amended orders 4 and 5 of the 21 October orders. Order 6 is a release from the implied undertaking to use the documents to decide whether to commence the proposed proceedings and ""otherwise to negotiate a settlement"". The first part of the order is not necessary and the second part is not, in my view, appropriate for the reasons noted above. 

17I have, therefore, not made the orders proposed by the Liquidator (subject to the reservation as to the position of third parties) and assented to by Mr McCarthy and Mr Seller so far as he adopted Mr McCarthy's submissions. I would also not make the Liquidator's alternative orders, which involved the same difficulties as the suggested consent orders, with an additional difficulty so far as it seeks to permit wider use of the information to be released. I should make clear that in taking this approach, I have not made any decision that it would not, in fact, be appropriate to grant access to transcripts to the Brents or proposed defendants to the proposed proceedings, if an appropriate application for such access was made and appropriate undertakings as to confidentiality and use were offered. I have instead decided the matter on the narrower basis that the Court should not join parties to an application as applicants where they do not bring one; should not order the release of transcripts, in the context of subsisting criminal proceedings, to persons who do not apply for it; and should not make confidentiality orders binding third parties in their absence in respect of the documents to which they do not seek access, where it would be straightforward for those persons to seek such access and offer appropriate confidentiality undertakings, if they wished to do so. 

18It would, of course, be open to the Liquidator to pursue his original application, which will squarely raise the issues addressed by the High Court in Hamilton v Oades, and I will relist the matter in the Corporations List in case he seeks to do so. Alternatively, any party who seeks access to the transcripts, for the purpose of settlement negotiations or otherwise, may prefer to take the course of simply applying for such access on the basis of an appropriate undertaking as to confidentiality and restrictions on the use of the documents, if so advised. 

19I therefore order that:

1. The matter be relisted in the Corporations List on 29 April 2013.

2. Costs be reserved.

2706913,Matthew Rose v R [2013] NSWCCA 71,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ AT CL: I agree with Bellew J and the orders which he proposes.

2SLATTERY J:I agree with Bellew J.

3BELLEW J: The applicant pleaded guilty before the District Court to two offences contrary to s. 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, namely:

(i)assault with intent to rob in company (""the first offence""); and

(ii)robbery in company (""the second offence"").

4In addition, the applicant asked the sentencing judge to take into account an offence of larceny contrary to s. 117 of the Crimes Act, which was contained on a Form 1.

5In respect of the first offence, the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole of 2 years commencing on 29 March 2011 and expiring on 28 March 2013, with an additional term of 1 year and 4 months expiring on 28 July 2014.

6In respect of the second offence, the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 29 June 2011 (i.e. 3 months after the commencement of the non-parole period in respect of the first offence) and expiring on 28 June 2013, with an additional term of 1 year and 4 months imprisonment expiring on 28 October 2014. 

7The total non-parole period was 2 years and 3 months. The applicant is eligible for release on parole on 28 June 2013. 

8The applicant now seeks leave to appeal against those sentences, on the grounds set out below.
 
THE FACTS
9An agreed statement of facts was before the sentencing judge. The following summary of those facts is taken from his Honour's reasons (commencing at AB 10).

The first offence
10At about 2:00am on 11 March 2011 a taxi driver named Ali Abdullah commenced his shift at Campbelltown. He received a message over the radio advising him that there was a job at the intersection of Chamberlain Street and Lindsay Street, Campbelltown. Mr Abdullah drove to that location and upon arrival he noticed a male, subsequently identified as the applicant's co-offender Mikey Hawly (""Hawly""), standing on Lindsay Street by himself. 

11Mr Abdullah pulled up in his taxi next to Hawly, who then entered the front passenger side of the taxi. Mr Abdullah asked Hawly where he wished to be taken, to which Hawly replied: 

""Give me your money"".

12Hawly then placed his hand on the transmission shift of the taxi and moved it into the ""park"" position. Mr Abdullah then felt a blow to the right side of his face which had been struck by a second male, later identified as the applicant, who was standing at the driver's side door of the taxi. Mr Abdullah was then punched in the face a number of times causing severe pain to his nose, his eyes and his cheek bone. The blows were sufficiently forceful to break frame of Mr Abdullah's spectacles.

13Hawly continued to demand money from Mr Abdullah. The applicant, who had remained outside of the driver's side window of Mr Abdullah's taxi, then reached in through the window of the taxi and tried to grab the keys from the ignition. Mr Abdullah hit the applicant's arm causing him to withdraw his hand, whereupon the applicant punched Mr Abdullah in the face again. 

14Mr Abdullah managed to put the vehicle transmission into the ""drive"" position and moved the taxi slowly forward. At the same time he commenced to sound his horn loudly in the hope that it might scare the applicant and Hawly away. Both the applicant and Hawly then ran off.

15Mr Abdullah drove directly to the Campbelltown Police Station to report the matter. CCTV footage taken from inside the taxi depicted Hawly and the applicant, along with a third (unidentified) male who was standing a few metres behind the applicant. 

16As a result of the attempted robbery, Mr Abdullah received a swollen and blackened right eye, bruising to his nose, and scratches and cuts to his face, nose, and forehead. Those injuries were depicted in photographs tendered before the sentencing judge. No money or other property was taken during the commission of the offence.

The second offence
17On the afternoon of 28 March 2011, Mr Noun Ros commenced his shift as taxi driver at Cabramatta West. At about 1:30am on 29 March 2011 Mr Ros received a message that there was a job available to pick up three passengers from premises in Tea Tree Place, Bossley Park. Mr Ros 
drove to that location, where he saw three men standing outside a house. 

18One of the men, later identified as Hawly, approached the taxi, entered the passenger's side and sat down. He then grabbed the transmission shift and placed it into the ""park"" position. At the same time a second male opened the driver's side door of Mr Ros' taxi and removed the keys from the ignition. Hawly demanded money, simultaneously with which two other men (one of them being the male who had removed the keys) leant into the taxi through the driver's side and removed $120 in cash.

19Mr Ros tried to get out of the taxi but was prevented from doing so by being struck on the head with a stick by one of the three men. He finally managed to get out of the vehicle at which time another of the men hit him, causing him to fall to the ground. The three men then ran off. As a consequence of trying to defend himself, Mr Ros suffered a lump on his head and a painful left arm. 

20The applicant was later identified by CCTV footage as one of the three men standing near the driver's side door of the taxi. Forensic evidence also established that the applicant's fingerprint was on that door. However, the applicant was not the man who was in possession of the stick which was used to assault Mr Ros. 

The applicant's sentence proceedings
21On 5 April 2012, the applicant appeared for sentence with another offender, Lawrence Sio Hausia (""Hausia""), who had been charged with similar offences. It was intended that Hawly would be sentenced on that same day, however his sentence proceedings were adjourned for a short period due to a delay in obtaining relevant medical evidence. Hawly was in fact sentenced some 8 days after the applicant. 

22During the course of both the applicant's sentence proceedings, as well those of Hawly, the sentencing judge made a number of references to the applicant, Hausia and Hawly being ""co-offenders"". In making such references, his Honour erred. Hausia's offences were not committed in the company of any other person. They were quite separate and distinct from the offences committed by the applicant and Hawly. However for the reasons set out below in relation to each of the grounds of appeal, I do not regard that error as material.

23In sentencing the applicant, and having recounted the facts, his Honour made specific reference (at AB 18-19) to the guideline judgment of this Court in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. In doing so his Honour, in reference to the decision in R v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, expressly recognized that the guideline judgement should be understood as involving a late plea of guilty. It is evident that his Honour was aware of the necessity to take into account the fact that in the present case, the applicant had entered an early plea.

24His honour then turned to the applicant's subjective case and noted, in particular, that the applicant:

(i)was 18 at the time of the commission of the offences, and was 19 years old at the time of sentence;

(ii)had previously committed an offence of possessing a prohibited weapon, namely a ""spud gun"", in respect of which he had been given the benefit of a bond pursuant to s. 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act only a matter of days before the commission of the first offence, a circumstance which his Honour correctly identified as an aggravating factor;

(iii)had no other criminal convictions and was essentially a young man of prior good character.

25His Honour then dealt, at some length, with the applicant's subjective case. In doing so, he made reference to various aspects of the applicant's family upbringing as well the contents of a report of a psychologist which had been tendered on his behalf. He then turned to those factors relied upon by the applicant in support of a finding of special circumstances.

26Having considered all of these matters, his Honour (at AB 25 ff) adopted a starting sentence of 4½ years, or 54 months. He applied a discount of 25 percent on account of the utilitarian value of the applicant's plea, which reduced the sentence by 13½ months, which was rounded up to 14 months in favour of the applicant. That left a head sentence of 40 months, or 3 years and 4 months imprisonment. 


27His Honour found special circumstances and proceeded (at AB 31) to impose the sentences previously outlined. I will return to consider specific aspects of his Honour's reasons when considering the two grounds of appeal.

Ground 1 - The sentencing judge failed to properly consider and apply the guideline judgment in R v Henry and Ors (1999) 46 NSWLR 346.
His Honour's reasons
28Having outlined the facts, his Honour specifically referred to the decision in Henry before turning to the particular circumstances of the applicant's offending. In that regard he said (at AB 19): 

""Here I have three young offenders with no or little criminal history. No weapon was used but they were in company at times with each other and at times other persons unknown. Thirdly, I accept that there was some degree of planning. There must have been to decide on to where to call the cab, to meet the cab driver there and perhaps, on occasions, to hide whilst one person initially approached the taxi driver. Here, there was limited actual violence. Each taxi driver was in a vulnerable position and the amounts of money and goods taken were generally not particularly great. Here, there was, in each case, a plea of guilty and as far as the two offenders who stand for sentence today are concerned, the Crown accepts that the pleas of guilty were entered at the earliest available opportunity. If one looks at the guideline judgment in R v Henry as involving a late plea of guilty, that would indicate a discount of only 10 percent. Allowing for such a discount, ranges between 4 years and 5 months imprisonment and 5 years and 6 months imprisonment""

29This passage contained two errors. Firstly, his Honour's reference to the fact that ""the amounts of money and goods taken were generally not particularly great"" was not correct. In the commission of the first offence to which the applicant pleaded guilty, no money or goods were taken at all. Secondly, his Honour concluded that there was ""limited actual violence"" in the applicant's offending. As previously noted, there were a number of blows struck by the applicant to Mr Abdullah in the course of committing the first offence. Those injuries were depicted in a photograph which formed part of the evidence on sentence. In the course of the second offence, Mr Ros had been struck with a stick by a person in the applicant's company, albeit not by the applicant himself. In these circumstances, his Honour's conclusion that there was ""limited actual violence"" in the applicant's offending was also an error, albeit one that favoured the applicant. In the circumstances, I do not regard either of these errors as material.

30His Honour later considered (at AB 23 - 24) the evidence relevant to a finding of special circumstances which he had been asked to make:

""Shortly after his being arrested the offender was incarcerated at Bathurst, commencing on 22 April 2011, and on 14 June 2011 was sent to Parklea Correctional Centre. Essentially, the offender has been in protective custody since that time. Exhibit 8 is from an officer at the Parklea Correctional Centre. It indicates that the offender is able to freely mix with other prisoners who are also in protective custody. He is ""unlocked"" for seven hours per day, which is the same as the normal prison population. He has access to programs including small business, literacy and numeracy, English, first aid, computer courses and therapeutic courses including drug and alcohol counselling. However, his work opportunities are limited. The only reason that I know of for the offender being in protective custody is that certain threats have been made to him. He is a young man, slightly built and one can understand that he may be the victim of other persons' attempted exploitation"". 

31His Honour then said (at AB 24 - 25):

""Between the three young men in the dock, there are five taxi driver victims of either robbery in company, wounding with intent to robbery (sic) in company or attempted robbery in company. Young offenders and indeed all offenders must know that, if they attack persons in vulnerable positions such as taxi drivers, they will be liable to suffer significant penalties. Unfortunately crimes against taxi drivers in southwest Sydney are notorious. They are often the victims of robberies and assaults. Were the court to impose lenient sentences none would be deterred from carrying out similar crimes in the future.""

32His Honour then made reference to the application of the normal statutory ratio and found special circumstances (at AB 25): 

""The fact is that this is a young man who was 18 at the time of his arrest and is now 19, who has spent over a year in custody already and the majority of it in protective custody. A first experience of imprisonment is alarming, upsetting, frightening, terrifying. It is that for a young man, equally that for a person who is much older"". 


33His Honour then imposed the sentences previously outlined. 

The submissions of the parties
34The applicant submitted that the sentencing judge adopted an ""inappropriately mechanistic approach"" to the guideline judgment in Henry which, it was submitted, had resulted in a failure to give adequate weight to the applicant's reduced moral culpability, as well as what were described as his ""compelling subjective circumstances"". This submission was advanced by reference to a series of separate propositions, in which it was submitted that his Honour: 


(i)imposed an identical sentence upon Hausia;


(ii)failed to explain the method by which he arrived at a starting sentence of 4½ years imprisonment;


(iii)""globally"" assessed all five of the offences affecting all three offenders, including those offences which had no connection to the applicant and in doing so had failed to adopt the approach set out in R v Kelly [2010] NSWCCA 259 and individually consider the applicant's offences, in circumstances where those offences could be distinguished from the those committed by Hausia and Hawly; and


(iv)failed to take into account the reduced moral culpability and significant subjective circumstances of the applicant, including the fact that he was aged 18 at the time of commission of the offences. 

35In response, the Crown submitted that it was evident that his Honour had considered the judgment in Henry, and had done so by specific reference to the applicant's offending. The Crown pointed out that not only were there two separate offences to which the guideline applied, the applicant's offending had features which rendered it more serious than the offending contemplated by the Henry guideline. In this regard the Crown relied upon: 


(i)the number of offenders involved;
(ii)the degree of planning; and 
(iii)the infliction of actual violence upon the victims.

36The Crown also submitted that on a fair reading of his Honour's reasons, he had not dealt with the offending in a ""global"" way. By reference to that passage of his Honour's reasons set out at [28] above, The Crown submitted that his Honour had regard to particular aspects of the offending. The Crown also submitted that, but for those errors to which I previously referred (the most significant of which favoured the applicant) his Honour's findings as to the circumstances of the offending were correct.

CONSIDERATION AND CONCLUSION
37In Henry, Spigelman CJ, in setting out a guideline for sentencing for offences pursuant to s. 97(1) of the Crimes Act said (at 380):

""It appears from the cases that come to this Court, including the present proceedings, that there is a category of case which is sufficiently common for the purposes of determining a guideline:

(i)young offender with no or little criminal history;
(ii)weapon like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury;
(iii)limited degree of planning;
(iv)limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof;
(v)victim in a vulnerable position such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver;
(vi)small amount taken;
(vii)plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case.

In my opinion sentences for an offence of the character identified above should generally fall between four and five years for the full term. I have arrived at this figure after drawing on the collective knowledge of the other four members of the Court with respect to sentence ranges. I have also reviewed the sentences which this Court has imposed on occasions when it has intervened, including in Crown appeals where the principle of double jeopardy applies. The proposed range is broadly consistent with this body of prior decisions in this Court.""

38His Honour went on to say (at 381):

""Aggravating and mitigating factors will justify a sentence below or above the range, as this Court's prior decisions indicate. The narrow range is a starting point.

In addition to factors which may arise in any case eg youth, offender's criminal record, cooperation with authorities, guilty plea in the absence of a strong case, rehabilitation efforts, offence committed whilst on bail etc, a number of circumstances are particular to the offence of armed robbery. These include: 

(i)nature of the weapon;

(ii)vulnerability of the victim;

(iii)position on a scale of impulsiveness/planning;

(iv)intensity of threat, or actual use, of force;

(v)number of offenders;

(vi)amount taken;

(vii)effect on victim(s).""


39In R v Kelly (supra) Kirby J (with whom the other members of the Court agreed) having referred to these passages from the decision in Henry said (at [52]):

""The Chief Justice identified the sentencing range for offences of that character. Sentences should generally fall between 4 and 5 years for the full term (at 380). That range assumed a 10% discount for a late plea (R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at [161] ). Where, as here, there was an early plea, calling for a discount of 25%, the adjusted sentencing range is as follows: 

5 years reduces to 3 years 9 months
4 years reduces to 3 years.""

40Having alluded to the aggravating and mitigating factors cited by Spigelman CJ in Henry (supra) Kirby J went on to say (at [54]):

""In sentencing the respondent, a number of issues therefore arose. First, the sentencing Judge was required to impose an appropriate sentence for each offence (Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610). A synthesis was required that reflected the circumstances of the individual offence (including the offender's state of mind), and whether it was better or worse than Henry, with appropriate adjustments for his subjective case (Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357).""

41In considering the submissions advanced on behalf of the applicant, it must be recognised that his Honour delivered judgment immediately following the hearing of evidence and submissions. This Court has said, on a number of occasions, that it is inappropriate to take an overly critical approach to reasons contained in ex tempore judgments which are made immediately following the hearing of submissions on sentence (see for example Gommesen v R [2012] NSWCCA 226 per Garling J at [37] - [38], McClellan CJ at CL and McCallum J agreeing); see also Warner (aka Jeremy Pachenko) v R [2013] NSWCCA 10 per S Campbell J at [33], Hoeben CJ at CL and Davies J agreeing). 

42In my view, bearing these matters in mind, none of the propositions advanced on behalf of the applicant establish that his Honour's approach was inappropriate in the sense which was submitted, or that such approach was otherwise erroneous. 

43Firstly, the fact that his Honour imposed identical sentences upon Hausia and the applicant is, in my view, not to the point. As I have already noted, Hausia was not a co-offender and accordingly, his offending, although of a similar nature, was separate and distinct from that of the applicant. 

44Secondly, and although his Honour did not set out, in specific terms, the reasons for adopting a head sentence of 4½ years imprisonment as a starting point, it does not follow that his Honour's reasoning process was not exposed. Having recited the facts his Honour made specific, and accurate, reference to the important aspects of the decision in Henry. He then considered certain aspects of the offending in the passage set out [26] above, before dealing comprehensively with the relevant aspects of the applicant's subjective case. He also, quite properly, recognised the need for both general and specific deterrence in the sentencing process. In all of these circumstances, his Honour's failure to explain, in precise terms, the method by which he arrived at a starting sentence of 4½ years imprisonment does not, in my view, reflect error. 

45Further in my view, his Honour's treatment of the offenders is not properly described as ""global"". It is evident from that part of his Honour's reasons extracted in paragraph [28] above that although his Honour dealt with the offences together, he cited specific features of the applicant's offending. As the Crown has correctly submitted, his Honour's findings as to the circumstances of the offending (but for those errors to which I previously referred) were accurate. 

46For these reasons I am unpersuaded that his Honour failed to follow the approach set out in Kelly (supra). To the extent that it was suggested that such a failure was reflected in his Honour's adoption of a starting point in excess of the ""adjusted"" guideline referred to by Kirby J in that case, it must firstly be remembered that his Honour was dealing with two separate offences, not one. Moreover, there is merit in the Crown's submission that the fact that there were multiple offenders, that there was a degree of planning, and that actual violence was perpetrated upon the victim in each case rendered the applicant's offending more serious than the typical case referred to in Henry. It must also be remembered that the guideline in Henry is a starting point, to be adjusted according to the circumstances of an individual case.

47Finally, I do not accept that his Honour failed to have regard to the applicant's reduced moral culpability, or his subjective circumstances, including his age. His Honour devoted a considerable part of his reasons to detailing the applicant's subjective case. He commenced his consideration of those matters by expressly citing the fact that the applicant was aged 18 at the time of the offences, and was 19 years of age at the time of sentence.


48For all of these reasons, this Ground is not made out.

Ground 2 - The sentences imposed upon the applicant give rise to a legitimate sense of grievance when compared with the sentences imposed upon his co-offender Hawly.

Hawly's sentence proceedings 
49In dealing with this ground it is necessary to make reference to some aspects of the reasons given by his Honour for the sentences imposed upon Hawly. 

50In determining Hawly's sentence, his Honour proceeded on the basis of the same facts as those I have previously outlined in respect of the applicant. In addition to the two offences which he committed in company with the applicant, Hawly also asked the sentencing judge to take into account a number of matters on a Form 1. They included a further offence of robbery in company (which did not involve the applicant) as well as a series of narcotics and firearms offences which arose as a consequence of prohibited substances and items which had been discovered by police at Hawly's premises. 

51His Honour accepted that at the time of his commission of two of the three robberies Hawly was affected by cannabis, and on another occasion was affected by alcohol. He further accepted that Hawly's commission of the offences was out of character, and had been precipitated by substance abuse and poor peer associations, due to the trauma of a break down in his family unit.

52In comparing Hawly's position with that of the applicant, his Honour said (at Hawly ROS 5):

""There is some difference between this offender and his co-offenders who was sentenced on 5 April. Lawrence Sio Hausia was aged 23 at the time of sentence but (the applicant) was only 19 years old at the time of sentence. (The applicant) and the co-offender were born in the same month. 

Hausia committed his offences whilst bound by (a) bond to be of good behaviour pursuant to s. 12. (The applicant) committed his offences whilst bound by a bond to be of good behaviour pursuant to s. 10.

Mikey Hawly comes before me as a young man of prior good character. He has no previous convictions nor any subsequent charge. Having said that, Mr Hawly asked me to take into account on a Form 1 a third robbery in company whilst the other two co-offenders were only sentenced in respect of two armed robberies each and the current offender asked me to take into account a number of other matters on the Form 1. However, I accede to the submission put to me by (counsel for the applicant) that the Crown's knowledge of the offender's involvement in the offence on 21 March 2011 stems only from his own admission of it rather than from any evidence obtained by the Crown.""

53Subsequently, and in reference to the special circumstances which applied in Hawly's case his Honour said (at Hawly ROS 9):

""Parity has a role to play. Clearly I cannot and would not sentence him to any lengthier period of imprisonment than I did for his co-offenders, Matthew Samuel Rose and Lawrence Sio Hausia. It has not been submitted otherwise. On behalf of the offender submissions have been put to me about the appropriate non-parole period. Here there is some reason to impose a different non-parole period on this offender and his co-offenders.

The first thing is to note that the offender was bashed shortly after he was first admitted to custody at Bathurst Goal. He has also been put under pressure to bring drugs into the prison, a pressure to which he has not succumbed. As I said he is an intelligent young man, he is slightly built, he is well presented and there are certain risks he runs in any custodial establishment.""


54His Honour (at Hawly ROS 10) then commenced with a head sentence of 4½ years imprisonment, to which he applied a discount of 25 percent on account of the pleas of guilty. He went on to say:

""In the cases of Rose and Hausia, I found special circumstances and fixed a non-parole period of 2 years with an additional term of 1 year and 4 months for the current offender I believe the appropriate non-parole period is 20 months or 1 year and 8 months and an additional term of 1 year and 8 months.
There are two offences and there must be, as I said, some partial accumulation. The partial accumulation will be 3 months, as in the case of his co-offenders.""


The submissions of the parties 
55It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that he had a justifiable sense of grievance when his sentence was compared with that of Hawly. In advancing this submission, counsel for the applicant focussed on the fact that although Hawly was sentenced for the same two offences as the applicant, he had also asked the court to take into account five offences set out in a Form 1 which, as previously noted, included a further offence of robbery in company. 

56Counsel further submitted that although the difference in the non-parole periods was one of only four months, this was, nevertheless a significant period. 

57In response, the Crown pointed to the reasons expressed by the sentencing judge (at Hawly ROS 9 in paragraph [53] above) for the difference in the non-parole periods which were imposed. The Crown submitted that, in contrast to Hawly's position, the applicant had been placed in protection at his own request following threats being made to him and that this was markedly different from Hawly's circumstances for a number of reasons, not the least of which was that conditions of the applicant's custody were not demonstrably different to those of the normal prison population. 

58In a broader sense, the Crown relied upon a series of factors which, it was submitted, differentiated between the respective positions of the applicant and Hawly. In particular, the Crown submitted that Hawly:

(i)had played a lesser role than the applicant in the commission of the first offence;

(ii)had no prior criminal history and was not subject to conditional liberty at the time of the commission of the offences, whereas the applicant had a criminal history and was subject to a bond under s. 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which had been imposed only a matter of days before the commission of the first offence;

(iii)had brought the fact of his involvement in the robbery offence which was included on the Form 1 to the police, in circumstances where there was no other evidence which linked him to the commission of that offence. 
 
CONSIDERATION AND CONCLUSION
59As the Crown set out in its written submissions, the parity principle is based upon the proposition that, as far as the law permits, like cases should be treated alike, and there should be different outcomes whether there are relevant differences (see generally Green v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 462). In the present case, the head sentence imposed on each of the applicant and Hawly was the same. There was a difference, of four months, in the non-parole periods which were imposed.

60The sentencing judge was obviously aware of the sentences which had been imposed on the applicant and he indicated in clear terms why it was that in sentencing Hawly, he had chosen to depart from the non-parole period imposed upon the applicant. In those circumstances, the observations of Howie J in Tatana v R (2006) NSWCCA 398 (with whom Sully and Latham JJ agreed) at [28] are relevant:

""That leaves a consideration of the issue of parity between the applicant and the co-offenders. This is a ground where there are considerable obstacles placed before the applicant in circumstances where the sentencing judge is fully aware of sentences imposed upon co-offenders, the reasons for those sentences, and in the remarks indicates why the judge is departing from the sentences imposed upon the others. Those obstacles became even greater where, as here, the difference is a result of legitimate fact finding on the part of the second judge.""

61The applicant placed some reliance upon on a further passage of Howie J in Tatana where his Honour said (at [32]):

""However, at the end of the day the applicant is to spend six months longer in custody before being released to parole notwithstanding that he was sentenced for less criminal activity than his co-offenders. That is on the face of it a somewhat surprising and troubling outcome. It cannot be explained other than by a failure on the part of Acting Judge Boulton to find remorse or that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation. To that extent there was a difference between the applicant and the co-offenders. But to my mind that difference could not warrant the applicant being required to serve a substantially longer period in custody than persons who had committed significantly more crime"".

62Counsel for the applicant submitted that in the present case, a situation similar to that considered by his Honour in Tatana had arisen. In particular, it was submitted that the applicant was in the position of having to serve a longer period of imprisonment than Hawly, even though the criminal activity for which he had been sentenced was less. 

63In my view, that submission should be rejected for two reasons.

64Firstly, there were, as I have set out, a number of factors which differentiated the respective positions of the applicant and Hawly. Those differentiating factors were to be found not only in a comparison of their respective offending, but also in a consideration of those matters which led his Honour to find special circumstances in each case. 

65Secondly, there can be no breach of the parity principle simply because, as is the case here, different non-parole periods were imposed as a consequence of different findings being reached as to the existence, and extent, of special circumstances (see Gill v R [2010] NSWCCA 236 at [62] per McColl JA (with whom Hulme and Latham JJ agreed). 

66For these reasons, this ground is not made out. 

67I should also observe that even if I had come to the view that either ground of appeal was made out, I would not have concluded that some other sentence was warranted in law (Criminal Appeal Act: s. 6(3)). The applicant's offending was serious, and in my view, the sentences imposed upon him by the sentencing judge are properly regarded as falling towards the lower end of the scale.
 
ORDERS
68I propose the following orders:
(1)leave to appeal granted;

(2)appeal dismissed.

2706922,R v Lancaster [2013] NSWSC 322,"Judgment
1HER HONOUR:  Shortly after midnight on 16 March 2011 the deceased, Raymond Ronald Flett, was attacked and killed by the accused, Dwayne Anthony Lancaster, while he was in bed on a rural property he owned at West Kempsey and which he shared with his de facto partner, Heather Gladman.  Mr Lancaster was a non-paying boarder at the property.  He moved to the property at the deceased's invitation within a week or so of his death.  
2Ms Gladman witnessed the fatal attack on the deceased.  However, after failed attempts to intervene in defence of the deceased and a failed attempt to call 000 for assistance she fled from the property into the bush in fear for her life.  
3Police found the deceased shortly before midday on 16 March 2011 on the veranda of his house after responding to a call from a neighbouring property earlier that morning when Ms Gladman emerged from the bush disoriented and in a dishevelled and highly distressed state after hiding in the bush for some hours.  
4The deceased was aged 57 at the time of his death.  At autopsy a complex wounding pattern to the deceased's head and neck was revealed, including blunt force injuries to the back of the head and left temporal region with an associated complex underlying skull fracture.  This wounding pattern was the product of at least nine separate blows.  A neuropathological report confirmed the presence of a traumatic brain injury with an associated subarachnoid haemorrhage over the left frontal and temporal lobes.  There were also deep incised wounds to the front of the deceased's neck transecting the oesophagus, the trachea, the carotid artery and the internal jugular vein.  A number of scratches (in the form of drag marks) were revealed on his upper right back of the deceased and his right arm.  A length of electrical cord and a phone plug cord were bound around the deceased's neck.  The forensic pathologist was not able to appoint the temporal sequence of the various injury patterns.  The deceased had a blood alcohol concentration of .158g/100ml at the time of death.
5It was not in contest that Mr Lancaster used a U-shaped iron shackle to inflict the injuries to the deceased's head and a meat cleaver to inflict the wounds to his neck.  The iron shackle was found by police in a gumboot on the veranda of the deceased's house.  The meat cleaver was found on the deceased's bed.  The drag marks were associated with Mr Lancaster dragging the deceased's body from the bed to the veranda.  The cords were bound around the deceased's neck in the course of the assault.
6On 16 March 2011 Mr Lancaster was charged with murder.  With the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions, and with leave granted under s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, his trial was listed to proceed without a jury.  On 8 April 2013 Mr Lancaster was arraigned before me.  He pleaded not guilty on the grounds of mental illness as provided for in s 22(2) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (the Act).   
7The sole issue at trial was whether Mr Lancaster had discharged the onus of establishing, on the probabilities, that he should be acquitted of murder on the grounds of mental illness pursuant to s 38 of the Act.  This is sometimes referred to as a special verdict.  The Crown did not seek to persuade me that a special verdict ought not be entered.
8The defence of mental ilness is made out if I am satisfied that at the time of the killing Mr Lancaster was suffering from a mental illness such that he did not know that it was wrong to deliberately assault the deceased with the iron shackle to his head and then to bind his neck with electrical cord before or after which he inflicted penetrating wounds across the front of the deceased's neck.  These assualtive acts, in combination, caused the death of the deceased, an issue about which there was no disagreement and which I am satisfied is established beyond reasonable doubt.  
9In deciding whether a special verdict should be entered I am obliged to have regard to the legal and practical consequences of a finding that Mr Lancaster is not guilty of murder on the grounds of mental illness.  I am not, however, required to decide whether the requisite intent for the offence of murder, that is, either an intention to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm, is proved (R v Minani [2005] NSWCCA 226; 62 NSWLR 490).  That question only arises if I do not find that the defence of mental illness is established.  For the reasons that follow, that issue does not arise in this case.   
10The Crown tendered a number of witness statements from people who had observed fluctuating changes in Mr Lancaster's behaviour in the weeks before the deceased's death, including two statements from Ms Gladman who gave a detailed account of the events of 15 March 2011 leading to the assault in the late evening of that day, or early morning of the next day, and a detailed description of the fatal assault at or shortly after midnight before she fled from the property.  The other materials tendered included the results of the police investigation, including Mr Lancaster's account to police upon his arrest; a post-mortem report of Professor Lyons and a report from Dr Buckland, a neuropathologist; two reports obtained by Mr Lancaster's solicitor from Dr Olav Nielssen, forensic psychiatrist, dated 10 August 2012 and 7 December 2012, and two reports obtained by the Crown from Dr Allnut dated 5 August 2012 and 26 March 2013.  The reports from both consultant forensic psychiatrists reflect their ultimate opinion that at the time of the assaults Mr Lancaster was suffering from a mental illness that deprived him of the capacity to consider the moral consequences of his behaviour. 
11No oral evidence was called in the proceedings.
The relationship between Mr Lancaster and the deceased preceding and on the night of the killing
12A week or so prior to the killing the deceased invited Mr Lancaster to reside in a detached dwelling, described as a ""studio"", on his property at Kempsey after he and Ms Gladman met Mr Lancaster at a local music event.  It is not entirely clear where Mr Lancaster was living prior to accepting that invitation although it would appear that he had in recent times been a resident in government subsidised accommodation in the Kempsey area and before that in a caravan.  
13Ms Gladman was a practiced musician who also taught music.  Mr Lancaster also displayed some musical talent.  The deceased apparently enjoyed the company of musicians, convening musical sessions at his home from time to time.  It would appear that after Mr Lancaster was invited to reside at the deceased's property there was a loose arrangement that Mr Lancaster and Ms Gladman would play music together and that Mr Lancaster would receive some musical tuition from her.  
14Both the deceased and Ms Gladman were aware that Mr Lancaster smoked cannabis (to which they apparently raised no objection) and that he had been maintained on a methadone program some time after his release from prison in early 2009 after serving a lengthy sentence for armed robbery.  The evidence would suggest that he was an habitual user of cannabis, using up to two grams per day.
15Mr Lancaster took up residence in the studio but within a few days moved into what was described as ""a shed"" some distance from the main house after reporting to Ms Gladman that he believed the studio was ""evil"" and was ""messing with his head"".  Over the intervening days, Mr Lancaster visited with the deceased and Ms Gladman and on occasions they played music and shared meals together.  She reported to others at about this time (and to police after the incident) that Mr Lancaster's behaviour was often erratic, which she described as ""out of character for a normal person"".  
16One of Mr Lancaster's friends, Anthony Wilson, also an amateur musician, was invited out to the property by Mr Lancaster to play some music some short time after he had taken up residence.  In his statement to police, Mr Wilson said that Ms Gladman expressed some concern to him about Mr Lancaster's erratic behaviour but that otherwise he saw nothing in Mr Lancaster's behaviour to alert him to any tension between them.  He also observed that Mr Lancaster and the deceased were talking and getting on well together.  Mr Wilson described Mr Lancaster as ""a little bit different from other people"" and to an extent ""unpredictable"" because he ""snaps at times over little things"".    
17On the afternoon of 13 March 2011 at a practice music session at Craig Johnson's house, Mr Lancaster took issue with Mr Wilson's criticism of Ms Gladman's guitar playing and the session was abandoned.  Both Mr Wilson and Mr Johnson said Mr Lancaster was saying things like, ""The world has got to work around me.  I am the leader of the band"", while he was jumping around in a hyped-up manner.  As quickly as his mood snapped it appeared that he calmed down, dropping to his knees whilst rocking back and forth.  
18On 15 March 2011 the deceased and Ms Gladman travelled to Port Macquarie to attend to shopping leaving Mr Lancaster at the property.  It is not clear whether they informed him of their intentions before leaving.
19That same morning Mr Lancaster told Mr Johnson that the people he was living with had given him the property, after having taken what they wanted of their personal effects, and that he was keen to renew his connection with the session musicians.  That same day he contacted another friend, Stephen Sullivan, to come out to the property as a matter of urgency.  When Mr Sullivan arrived, Mr Lancaster told him that the owners of the property required him to kill some goats which were restrained under the house and that they had gone away for a holiday telling him he could stay at the property as long as he wanted.  Mr Lancaster had a meat cleaver with him.  Mr Sullivan persuaded him not to harm the animals. 
20Later that afternoon, upon their return from Port Macquarie, Ms Gladman and the deceased found Mr Lancaster sitting on a chair on the path near the main house, looking agitated.  He challenged them both, in effect demanding to know what they were doing, why they had moved items around the house and why tyres at the front of the property had numbers on them.  He was behaving in what Ms Gladman described as ""a paranoid manner"".  Being unable to reason with Mr Lancaster she ultimately demanded that he leave the property.  The deceased apparently found the meat cleaver near the goat compound and when Mr Lancaster was asked what it was doing there he said that he had taken it to kill the goats because he thought the goats were making Ms Gladman angry.  She remonstrated with him and warned him not to harm her animals.  In her statement she said that about 15 or 20 minutes later the deceased went up to the shed to speak to Mr Lancaster when an argument erupted.  At that time the deceased told Mr Lancaster he had to leave the property the following day.
21Some time later that afternoon or evening Mr Lancaster joined the deceased and Ms Gladman for a meal in the main house.  Ms Gladman said he appeared to her to be cheerful and happy, looking forward to the future, and that it did not appear to her that he had been told, or understood, that he had to leave the property.  
22After dinner a further argument erupted, this time about the deceased's alcohol consumption (the deceased, in Ms Gladman's estimation, having drunk some whiskey and at least two bottles of wine that night) and what Mr Lancaster thought was the deceased's disrespectful treatment of her.  
23The argument did not erupt into violence.  Mr Lancaster left the main house and the deceased went to bed.  Ms Gladman was cleaning the kitchen and generally tending to household duties when she heard Mr Lancaster outside yelling and swearing in a highly agitated state.  She went outside and tried to settle him but his agitation increased.  She told police that he kept asking for a gun which he said he wanted to use to kill the deceased.  When he was told the deceased was asleep and there was no gun in the house he said repeatedly, ""If he wakes up I will kill him"".  When Ms Gladman said she would call the police Mr Lancaster took the phone from her and cut the receiver from the wall.  Despite her efforts to restrain him, Mr Lancaster then went in to the deceased's bedroom and launched himself at the deceased who was lying on the bed and attempted to strangle him.  At this time Ms Gladman said Mr Lancaster was saying, ""No Mum, don't Mum.  No"".  She then grabbed for the iron shackle (which was beside the bed, apparently being part of a restraint used to contain the goats).  Mr Lancaster wrested it from her and struck her with it before bringing it down repeatedly onto the deceased's head whilst repeating, ""I don't want to hurt you mum"".  He also said, ""It will be alright, we can do this"".  At this time Ms Gladman could hear the deceased gasping for breath.  Mr Lancaster called her to get a rope saying, ""He's not dead yet"".  Under the pretence of getting a rope she went outside and headed off into the bush.  From her hiding place she could hear Mr Lancaster walking around the house in an aggressive and agitated state calling out to her, ""Don't go mum, don't go.  Alright I'll wait for you to come out"".  She maintained her hiding place.  She then heard him yell out ""The fucking keys better be there"" and heard him opening and closing car doors.  She then heard him having a shower and singing, after which she heard him start his motorcycle.  In a state of disorientation and terror, she remained in the bush until she eventually followed the river to her neighbour's property the following morning.
Mr Lancaster's various statements after the killing and to police after his arrest
24Mr Lancaster drove to Kempsey on his motorcycle on the morning of 16 March 2011 and went directly to where Peter Alder worked with Rodney Goodwin in a business constructing metal water tanks.  Mr Alder had known Mr Lancaster at that time for about 18 months and knew that he had moved into what he was told was a hippy commune at the invitation of some people Mr Lancaster had met at a music event.  When he arrived at the business that morning Mr Alder described Mr Lancaster as being in the same state of mind as he had presented with over the previous two weeks, namely, ""off his head to some degree ... of a different mind than normal"".  Mr Alder said that after Mr Lancaster arrived he started to talk about things in general and then suddenly said, ""I killed him"".  When he was asked who he had killed he said, ""The man out there.  He thought he was Jesus.  He wanted me to do it. ... She stood there and watched me do it, and then turned and walked away"".  Mr Lancaster then started to cry before he asked for petrol for his motorcycle and left.  Neither Mr Alder nor Mr Goodwin took Mr Lancaster's statements seriously.  
25Meanwhile, whilst at the property police prepared themselves for a confrontation with Mr Lancaster having been told by Ms Gladman of the events of the night before and being informed by her that Mr Lancaster was, so far as she knew, still at the property.
26Police saw Mr Lancaster's motorcycle discarded and partially camouflaged on the side of the road near the shed.  They then saw Mr Lancaster emerge from the shed and walk towards them.  He submitted to their direction to lie on the ground and to keep his hands in the air to allow for the attachment of handcuffs.  At this time Mr Lancaster said, ""I won't hurt anyone ever again ... There's a dead man down the hill"".  He was then placed under arrest and cautioned.  
27A short time later, after the police had located the body of the deceased, Mr Lancaster denied directing police to the deceased.  He said that he was living on the property with Ms Gladman who had been teaching him music, and that she lived alone.  When he was asked whether he had assaulted the deceased he said, ""I don't know what you're talking about"".  When he was asked whether he understood that the deceased's body had been found he said that he did not understand what was happening.    
28En route to the police station Mr Lancaster was chanting, ""Not allowed to kill, not allowed to kill.  That's the final lesson"".  At the police station he was heard to say, ""Ray I'll never hurt any man again.  I will never watch and hurt again"".  Whilst in the dock he was heard to say, ""They've been feeding me - Heather and Ray...  I'm never gonna hurt a man ever again...  Don't let Heather go, she is an evil woman...  No man is god...  I'm a dog - its god backwards... Japan ran out of rice and it wasn't my idea - Ray told me they ran out of rice... I'm not God, please test me, I learned, I grew, they let me sing all the time"".
Mr Lancaster's mental health after his arrest
29Since being remanded in custody, and prior to being interviewed by Dr Nielssen and Dr Allnutt in August 2012 for the purpose of these proceedings, Mr Lancaster was provisionally diagnosed by Dr Dayalan, consultant forensic psychiatrist, in March 2012 as having suffered a drug induced psychosis that appeared to have resolved with antipsychotic medication.  While that diagnosis has, in my view, been overtaken by the reports of Dr Nielssen and Dr Allnutt, Dr Dayalan did have regard to Mr Lancaster's prior psychiatric history gathered by Justice Health over the course of his institutional history as a serving prisoner between about 1998 and 2009, namely:The information gathered from the interviews and documents reviewed suggest that Mr Lancaster has a history of opioid dependence and abuse of cannabis and amphetamines.  He is currently on methadone maintenance program.
Mr Lancaster has a history of mood instability, multiple self harm attempts, poor impulse control, difficulty in controlling anger and transient psychotic symptoms.  This is consistent with a diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder and concurs with the opinion of a number of other psychiatrists who have seen Mr Lancaster whilst in custody.
30Dr Dayalan also set out Mr Lancaster's personal history as follows:Mr Lancaster stated that he was born in Australia but reported that he could not remember where in Australia he grew up.  It was noted from an earlier entry that he had grown up in the Campbelltown region... He described his father to be an alcoholic who used to physically abuse him.  He stated that he had never met his biological mother but had a good relationship with his foster mother.  [I note that the materials tendered on the trial included a statement from Judith Mazz, his foster mother, which attests to that relationship.]  He denied a history of sexual abuse.  He stated he was not aware of any family history of mental illness.  He had reported...that his father had committed suicide and had been sexually abused by one of his dad's friends...
In regard to his schooling he stated that he had been expelled from school on a number of occasions.  He admitted a history of excessive fighting in school, running away from home, damaging property, stealing, being placed in boys home and juvenile detention centre.  He stated that he left school in Year 8 when he [was] expelled.  He described himself to have been average [academically].  He stated that he has [only been employed once] which was building cool rooms, and he had continued this for about 12 months.  He denied any problems in this employment but it was terminated following his arrest.  He reported to have had two relationships in the past.  He stated that they had not lasted more than a couple of months.
Other psychiatric evidence tendered at the trial
Dr Nielssen  
31In August 2012 Dr Nielssen examined Mr Lancaster in custody.  He summarised his presentation at that time as follows:  Mr Lancaster presented dressed in prison clothes with short hair and a neatly trimmed beard.  He smelled strongly of tobacco and had tobacco stained fingers.  He had tattoos visible on his neck and hands including some professionally drawn tattoos on his hands.  There were no obvious signs of neurological disorder, for example, ... abnormal movements or impairment in articulation.  He had an institutional manner and spoke with the usages of someone who had been a long term prisoner, and made liberal use of profanity.  He was suspicious of questions, made little eye contact and his underlying mood seemed quite depressed.  He was labile in his manner and became easily angered when taken to some aspects of the allegations and his personal history.  He reported typical symptoms of schizophrenia-like psychosis in the form of hallucinations of voices that seemed to come from the radio, which he recognised to be due to mental illness and did not offer a delusional explanation for his experiences.  However, he described delusions of reference around the time of the offences, and what seemed to be delusional beliefs regarding [the deceased] and Ms Gladman.
He was approximately oriented and had some knowledge of current events, for example, the dates of his court hearings.  His intelligence was estimated to be within the normal range from his reported literacy and his social function whilst at liberty...  
32When asked about his relationship with the deceased and Ms Gladman he confirmed the account given by her and others as to how they met and the circumstances in which he came to be living with them at the deceased's property.    
33He told Dr Nielssen that he had been alone for a day in the week before the offence and he had ""spun out"" and felt as though he was in some kind of danger.  He said at times he felt that the deceased and Ms Gladman were ""talking to [him] and not to [him] like they had some sort of ulterior [motive] ... what they were saying did not add up"".  He went on to say that he thought that they were drugging him as he would lose days on end.  He said, ""Then they killed a little goat and put its collar on their dog and feed me the meat"".  He said that Ms Gladman played with bones on the table and pretended to be able to read them and that was when it occurred to him that they may have been involved in the occult.  When he was shown Ms Gladman's statement to police he said, ""I believe she has killed him and told them that I've done it... I believe she has drugged my coffee"".  He went on to say that ""she was the more sinister of the two"".  He said he believed that he called out to his mother because she had drugged him and that the police were hiding his toxicology results.  
34Dr Nielssen offered a differential diagnosis which included a substance dependence and abuse disorder, by reason of a history of long standing daily use of cannabis and complications of cannabis use, in particular its role in triggering an acute psychotic episode around the time of the offence.  He also diagnosed a probable schizophrenic illness (in partial remission) on the basis of a reported history of long standing and typical auditory hallucinations.  He also noted Mr Lancaster's account of delusions of reference around the time of the offence and enduring delusional beliefs regarding Ms Gladman soon after the offence with an observed lability in mood accompanied with tangential thinking.  The mental illness was described by Dr Nielssen as being in partial remission as a result of Mr Lancaster's treatment with potent antipsychotic medication in the relatively drug-free environment of a maximum security prison.
35Dr Nielssen concluded that despite the limitations of a single interview and the limited documentation that was available to him, his preliminary opinion was that Mr Lancaster had developed delusional beliefs regarding the deceased and Ms Gladman and that the offence was motivated by a defect of reason arising from those beliefs rather than any rational motive.  In Dr Nielssen's opinion, Mr Lancaster's acutely psychotic state, apparent in the period after his arrest, and his increased arousal and disorganised thinking associated with an acute psychotic illness rendered Mr Lancaster unable to reason with any sense or composure about the wrongfulness of his actions at the time of the fatal assault.
Dr Allnutt
36Dr Allnut examined Mr Lancaster at the request of the Crown in August 2012.  He did not have Dr Nielssen's report available to him at that time.  His observations on the presentation of Mr Lancaster in the interview were similar to those described by Dr Nielssen.  His mental status examination was described as follows:  [He] presented as somewhat irritable but cooperative; he complained about feeling claustrophobic and wanting to leave the interview relatively early; his replies were relatively short and brief; his affect was restricted; he endorsed a number of depressive symptoms but none of mania or hypomania; there was not suicidal ideation plan or intent; he endorsed a number of perceptual phenomena in the form of auditory hallucinations and referential ideas as well as paranoid ideas that others were planning or plotting to harm him; he endorsed a number of symptoms of anxiety as well; he presented as cognitively reasonably intact but his capacity for insight and judgment was questionable.
37So far as Mr Lancaster's psychiatric condition was concerned, Dr Allnutt was of the view that his symptoms were consistent with probable mild psychotic phenomena that had continued unabated since his incarceration in March 2011.  Although he was guarded in his diagnosis, Dr Allnutt observed that Mr Lancaster manifested ongoing symptoms of a depression and probably psychosis (which in his view was likely resolving secondary to medication and abstinence from illicit drugs).  Being aware that Dr Nielssen had recently interviewed Mr Lancaster, Dr Allnutt reserved his ultimate opinion as to Mr Lancaster's mental state at the time of the offending until such time as he had considered that report.  
38Dr Nielssen examined Mr Lancaster in custody again on 14 November 2012 and 6 December 2012.  He summarised his presentation at that time as follows: ...  He was more subdued in his manner than during the previous interview, but did not seem as depressed.  Moreover, his judgment had also improved, as he did not swear or become heated and was more forthcoming and reflective about the events around the offence and about his mental state at that time.  He reported typical symptoms of schizophrenia-like psychosis in the form of hallucinations of voices, which he recognised to have been due to mental illness, and also identified his beliefs regarding [the deceased] and Ms Gladman to be delusional.
He was correctly oriented and had some knowledge of current events, for example, the dates of his transfers and his trial.  His intelligence was estimated to be within the normal range, from his reported literacy and his social performance whilst at liberty...
39The additional history obtained during the interview, and the information in medical records made available to Dr Nielssen, including Mr Lancaster's Justice Health medical record since his remand, confirmed a diagnosis of schizophrenia, further supporting Dr Nielssen's earlier opinion that Mr Lancaster's behaviour at the time of the killing was motivated by delusional beliefs and that the high level of arousal associated with his psychotic state, and the gross disturbance of his capacity for logical thinking, deprived him of the ability to reason with sense or composure about alternative courses of action that were open to him (presumably at the time of the onset of his anger at the deceased's consumption of alcohol leading up to the time of the fatal assault).  Dr Nielssen also noted Mr Lancaster's ongoing progress in recovering from the acute phase of the illness but confirmed the need for indefinite treatment and support, including a maintenance programme of antipsychotic medication. 
40Dr Allnutt furnished a further report in March 2013 by which time he had been provided with the reports of Dr Nielssen and Mr Lancaster's Justice Health notes, together with the report by Dr Dyalan in March 2012 prepared for Justice Health.  After considering that material (and reviewing the witness statements), Dr Allnutt concluded: Based on the information provided to me, the defendant suffers from a chronic psychotic disorder; while a differential diagnosis of a drug induced psychosis is a reasonable consideration, on balance, the persistence of symptoms despite treatment for a fairly lengthy period of time after his arrest in an environment that has less access to drugs, suggests a more chronic condition independent of substances; the expectation would be that a drug induced psychosis would resolve more rapidly so a diagnosis of a chronic psychotic disorder such as a chronic paranoid schizophrenia or a schizoaffective disorder is the more relevant diagnostic category; at the time that I saw him he continued to manifest residual but resolving symptoms of psychosis and mood disorder, secondary to the medication that he is receiving.
41When considering the question as to Mr Lancaster's mental state at the time of the offending, the issue that was residual from the earlier report, he said: I have considered the possibility that the alleged offence was merely an angry reaction to being asked to leave [the deceased's property]; however when taking into consideration the objective evidence by witnesses (who noted a deterioration in his mental state characterised by disorganised communication, his long history of cannabis use, his odd behaviour and statements reported by [Ms] Gladman prior and during the alleged offence; and his demeanour and apparently odd statements during the forensic procedure), and considering this, in light of the history he provided and the opinion of treating psychiatrists, on balance he was suffering a mental illness at the material time of the alleged offence and that his behaviour was driven by a mental illness.
Mental state at the time of the offence
42As I have noted, the consultant psychiatrists are of the unanimous view that at the time of the killing Mr Lancaster was suffering from a disease of the mind, being schizophrenia or a schizoaffective disorder, that prevented him from recognising the moral wrongfulness of his actions and which operated to compromise his capacity to understand the true nature and quality of his actions.  Having regard to their expert opinion and the other evidence tendered in the proceedings I am satisfied that the defence of mental illness has been established and that a verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness should be returned. 
43Both Dr Allnutt and Dr Nielssen were of the opinion that Mr Lancaster requires ongoing psychiatric care and supervision.  I note that he is not detained as a forensic patient but that as at December 2012 was housed at the Parklea Correctional Centre where he had a job as a sweeper.  On the other hand, his counsel does not submit that I would order Mr Lancaster's release into the community, either unconditionally or on conditions under s 39(2) of the Act, there being no evidential basis to support a submission by him or a finding by me that neither his safety nor the safety of other members of the community would not be put seriously at risk were he released.  The alternative is to order that he be detained in custody under the supervision of the Mental Health Review Tribunal until a decision is made to release him under s 39(1) of the Act.
44The Tribunal's functions include a review of his case as soon as practicable after an order is made under s 39 of the Act.  The Tribunal may make orders thereafter concerning his continued detention, care or treatment on review at six monthly intervals and make appropriate orders as to his continued detention, care or treatment in a hospital, prison or other place, or order his release into the community either conditionally or unconditionally.  I also note that the Tribunal cannot make an order for his release unless it is satisfied that his safety or any member of the public would not be seriously endangered and that the Tribunal must notify the Minister of Health and the Attorney General in advance of any order for his release in order that the Executive may make submissions to the Tribunal in relation to that question.
Orders
45Accordingly, I make the following orders:1.  Pursuant to s 38 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, a special verdict of not guilty of the charge of murder by reason of mental illness is returned.
2.  Pursuant to s 39 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, Dwayne Anthony Lancaster is to be detained in a correctional facility or at such other place as determined by the Mental Health Review Tribunal until released by due process of law.
3.  I direct that the Registrar notify the Minister of Health of these orders. 
4.  I direct that the Registrar notify the Mental Health Review Tribunal of my verdict and of these orders.  I also direct that the Registrar provide the Tribunal with a copy of these reasons and my orders and a copy of the exhibits tendered during the special hearing.

		10 April 2013",2013-04-09 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2706931,R v Abdollahi (No 12) [2013] NSWSC 485,"Judgment
1HIS HONOUR:  Mr Little, counsel for the accused Shahsawari, has made a submission that the counts in the indictment of riot and affray are bad for duplicity.  An order is sought requiring the Crown to elect as to which of two elements it is relying upon in respect of each charge.
The late raising of the issue
2Mr Shahsawari was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to those counts on 17 August 2012.  Pre-trial hearings of various evidentiary issues commenced on 29 January 2013.  Mr Shahsawari was re-arraigned in the presence of a jury panel on 11 February 2013 and again pleaded not guilty.  The trial proceeded to a point midway through the second-last of ten closing addresses by counsel when Mr Little raised this issue last Friday, 5 April 2013.
3A written outline of submissions was provided.  I expressed concern about the lack of authority cited and, in the event there was nothing directly on point, the lack of any reference to relevant general principles.  Further written submissions were provided over the weekend.  The Crown provided written submissions in response. Mr Little made brief oral submissions in response to the Crown.
4None of counsel for the other accused have sought to join in or support the point raised by Mr Little.
5Some members of the jury were unavailable on Tuesday and Wednesday (for reasons presently irrelevant) so that the conclusion of my summing up, which commenced on Monday 8 April, was deferred until today.  This has allowed me to consider Mr Little's point with less haste.
The duplicity alleged
6Riot and affray became statutory offences when ss 93B and 93C were inserted in the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) by the Crimes Amendment Act 1988 (NSW).  The provisions are currently in the following terms:
93B  Riot(1)  Where 12 or more persons who are present together use or   threaten unlawful violence for a common purpose and the conduct of them (taken together) is such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety, each of the persons using unlawful violence for the common purpose is guilty of riot and liable to imprisonment for 15 years.(2)  It is immaterial whether or not the 12 or more persons use or threaten unlawful violence simultaneously.(3)  The common purpose may be inferred from conduct.(4)  No person of reasonable firmness need actually be, or be likely to be, present at the scene.(5)  Riot may be committed in private as well as in public places.
93C  Affray(1)  A person who uses or threatens unlawful violence towards another and whose conduct is such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety is guilty of affray and liable to imprisonment for 10 years.(2)  If 2 or more persons use or threaten the unlawful violence, it is the conduct of them taken together that must be considered for the purposes of subsection (1).(3)  For the purposes of this section, a threat cannot be made by the use of words alone.(4)  No person of reasonable firmness need actually be, or be likely to be, present at the scene.(5)  Affray may be committed in private as well as in public places.
7The italicised words in s 93B(1) and s 93C(1) are at the heart of Mr Little's argument.  He contends that the sections each create two offences.  In s 93B, the offences are said to be ""Where 12 or more persons who are present together use unlawful violence"" and ""Where 12 or more persons who are present together threaten unlawful violence"".  In s 93C the offences are said to be where ""A person uses unlawful violence towards another"" or where ""A person threatens unlawful violence towards another"".
8Mr Little cited S v The Queen [1989] HCA 66; (1989) 168 CLR 266 and Walsh v Tattersall [1996] HCA 26; (1996) 188 CLR 77 as authority for the proposition, derived in each case from Archbold, Pleading, Evidence and Practice in Criminal Cases, that ""no one count of the indictment should charge the defendant with having committed two or more separate offences"".  So much may be accepted.
The charge of riot
9R v Tyler (1993) 96 Cr App R 332 was suggested to be directly on point in relation to the offence of riot.  Regrettably it has been misread, misunderstood, or both.  
10The English offence of riot in s 1(1) of the Public Order Act 1986 (UK) is in identical terms to s 93B (aside from the latter using gender-neutral language and including a statement as to the maximum penalty).  In R v Tyler the indictment alleged that the accused, as well as the others who made up the ""12 or more persons"" had ""used or threatened unlawful violence"".  Farquharson LJ, giving judgment for the Court of Appeal, held (at 335):
It will be seen that the indictment preferred in this case is at the very least defective.  For a person to be guilty of riot it must be proved that he or she used unlawful violence for the common purpose.  The particulars of the offence are cast in wider terms in the indictment, alleging that the accused ""used or threatened"" unlawful violence.  The words ""used or threatened"" appear in the subsection but in the context of the behaviour of the 12 or more persons.
11In R v Hawi (No 18) [2011] NSWSC 1664, I granted leave to amend an indictment that erroneously averred a count of riot in a similar fashion to that in R v Tyler.  In the course of that judgment I referred to R v Jefferson [1994] 1 All ER 270 which, if there be any doubt about what R v Tyler stands for, makes it patently clear where Auld J said (at 275):
As this court has recently observed in R v Tyler (1992) 96 Cr App R 332, this provision has two parts. The first specifies the context, namely 'Where 12 or more persons who are present together use or threaten unlawful violence for a common purpose ...' The context of the offence thus provides, as an alternative to the use of unlawful violence, a threat of such violence. The second part of the section specifies the actual offence, namely 'each of the persons using unlawful violence for the common purpose is guilty of riot'. The offence, so described, thus does not include the threat of unlawful violence as an alternative to its use. 
An indictment charging an offence under s 1(1) of the 1986 Act should reflect the two parts of the provision, first stating the statutory context and second the commission, within that context, of the offence as defined.  (Emphasis added).
12There is no suggestion in either of those cases of there being any question of s 1(1) creating two offences.  Even though the indictments in each case were regarded as defective, duplicity was not raised as an issue at all.  Clearly, a single offence was created by the statutory provision; that within a context of ""12 or more persons who are present together use or threaten unlawful violence for a common purpose"" a person ""used unlawful violence for the common purpose"".
13The indictment in the present case avers the offence of riot in the following terms:
Between 20 April 2001 and 22 April 2001, at Villawood in the State of New South Wales, being one of twelve or more persons present together using or threatening unlawful violence for a common purpose did use unlawful violence for the said common purpose and the conduct of the twelve or more persons taken together was such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness then being present at the scene to fear for his/her personal safety.
14This is entirely in conformity with R v Tyler and R v Jefferson.  A single offence is charged.  There is no duplicity.
The charge of affray
15Mr Little cited no authority in support of his contention that the count of affray was bad for duplicity, or that s 93C creates two offences.  
16The Public Order Act (UK) provides for an offence of affray in s 3.  The offence in s 93C of the Crimes Act (NSW) is based upon it:  see Colosimo and Ors v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2005] NSWSC 854; (2005) 64 NSWLR 645, per Johnson J at [11] - [14]. 
17Mr Little made reference to a suggested form of pleading an offence of affray in Blackstone's Criminal Practice (a photocopy was provided but the edition was not cited):
A on or about the ... day of ... used [or threatened] violence towards one V, the conduct of A being such as to cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his personal safety.
18I do not regard that suggested form of pleading as authority for the proposition that ""it is clear ... that the English position is"" that ""used"" and ""threatened"" are separate and distinct elements of the offence of affray:  Mr Little's written submissions of 6 April 2013 at p.2.  
19In relation to the offence of riot, the suggested form of pleading includes in relation to the ""12 or more persons"" that they were ""using [or threatening] unlawful violence"".  The submission that this means that ""it is clear ... that the English position is"" that ""using unlawful violence"" and ""threatening unlawful violence"" are separate and distinct elements of the offence of riot is clearly wrong, having regard to R v Tyler and R v Jefferson.  Whilst highly respected, Blackstone, if its suggested pleadings are intended to convey what Mr Little asserted, cannot prevail over the Court of Appeal.
20In Colosimo & Ors v DPP (NSW), Johnson J referred (at [14]) to the New South Wales Parliament, in enacting s 93C (and s 93B), having very closely followed the equivalent provisions in the Public Order Act (UK).  For this reason he considered the authorities in that jurisdiction as being of assistance in the construction of the New South Wales provisions. They included I v Director of Public Prosecutions [2001] UKHL 10; [2002] 1 AC 285 where Hutton LJ said at [17]:
The offence of affray, both at common law and now under statute, was primarily intended to punish a person or persons who engaged in a face to face confrontation where violence was used or threatened and where reasonably firm-minded members of the public would be put in fear.  As Lord Bingham of Cornhill CJ said in R v Smith (Christopher) [1997] 1 Cr App R 14, 17: ""It typically involves a group of people who may well be shouting, struggling, threatening, waving weapons, throwing objects, exchanging and threatening blows and so on"". 
21After extensively quoting from a 1983 report of the Law Commission, Offences Relating to Public Order (Law Com No 123), Hutton LJ continued at [24]:
Therefore it is apparent that the Law Commission and Parliament intended that the offence set out in section 3 should penalise those who engage in a fight, whether they are landing blows, or attempting to land blows, or threatening to land blows ... .
22The Law Commission had initially considered that a statutory offence of affray should be confined to the actual use of violence and exclude threatened violence.  However, it was persuaded to change that view upon a consideration of a number of factual situations, including the following quoted in the judgment of Hutton LJ at [23]:
[I]t has been urged on us that there is no reason of substance why, in this context, a punch thrown which misses should be distinguished from one which lands on another person; and, if there were insufficient evidence to show that any of those accused actually succeeded in hitting another, no one, upon our provisional proposal, would have been guilty of the offence ... .
23Throughout the judgment of Hutton LJ there are references to ""the offence"" of affray.  There is no suggestion that s 3 of the Public Order Act (UK) created two offences.  For example, his Lordship concluded his judgment at [28] thus:
The present case demonstrates that a person should not be charged with the offence unless he uses or threatens unlawful violence towards another person actually present at the scene and his conduct is such as would cause fear to a notional bystander of reasonable firmness.  (Emphasis added).
24In R v Smith [1997] 1 Cr App R 14 at 17, Bingham LCJ provided the following general description of the offence of affray:
[The offence of affray] typically involves a group of people who may well be shouting, struggling, threatening, waving weapons, throwing objects, exchanging and threatening blows and so on.  Again, typically it involves a continuous course of conduct, the criminal character of which depends on the general nature and effect of the conduct as a whole and not on particular incidents and events which may take place in the course of it.  Where reliance is placed on such a continuous course of conduct it is not necessary for the Crown to identify and prove particular incidents.  To require such proof would deprive section 3(1) of the 1986 Act of its intended effect, and deprive law-abiding citizens of the protection which this provision intends that they should enjoy.  It would be asking the impossible to require a jury of 12 men and women to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that each or any incident in an indiscriminate melee such as constitutes the typical affray was proved to the requisite standard.
25The reasoning of the Law Commission as quoted by Hutton LJ in I v Director of Public Prosecutions is consistent with that of Bingham LCJ in R v Smith and that of Johnson J in Colosimo & Ors v DPP (NSW).  Following his extensive review of the history and the authorities concerning the offence of affray, Johnson J said at [89]:
In some cases of affray, of course, where two or three persons only may be involved, identification of the particular acts of individual persons may be easier.  However, the fact that such identification of individual acts may not be available where a larger number of persons are involved in a fluid brawl or melee does not mean that persons involved in such an incident cannot be convicted of the offence of affray.  It is necessary to bear in mind the elements of the offence under s 93C of the Act.  In my view, those elements may be satisfied where a finding is open that persons charged with affray have engaged in lawful violence even if the specific acts committed by each individual cannot be precisely identified.  ...
26This, in my view, strongly supports the proposition that it is a single element of the offence of affray that a person used or threatened unlawful violence.   To hold otherwise would be, to adapt the words of Bingham LCJ, to deprive s 93C of its intended effect.
27The indictment in the present case avers in respect of Mr Shahsawari a count of affray in these terms:
On 20 April 2011, at Villawood in the State of New South Wales, did use or threaten unlawful violence towards Serco staff and other people at the Villawood Detention Centre and such conduct would cause a person of reasonable firmness then being present to fear for his/her personal safety.
28The count is framed in accordance with s 93C.  I am persuaded that the section contains only a single offence.  There is no duplicity.
The sole issue is asserted duplicity
29Finally, I note that it was no part of Mr Little's argument that there is any uncertainty in the case that the Crown has presented to the jury against Mr Shahsawari.  The Crown has precisely identified his alleged acts upon which it relies and there has been no complaint of there being any doubt as to the case that the accused has been required to meet.  There has been no suggestion that there is any prejudice or embarrassment to the accused in the manner in which the Crown case has been framed and in the particulars that have been given, and no suggestion that there would be any lack of certainty in what a verdict of guilty would entail the jury having been satisfied of beyond reasonable doubt.
Conclusion
30The application for an order requiring the Crown to make an election to avoid duplicity in the charges of riot and affray is refused.

2706933,R v Abdollahi (No 11) [2013] NSWSC 484,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: Mr Paish, counsel for the accused Haider Hussein Ali, asks that self-defence be left as an issue for the jury to consider. Mr Ali is accused of riot and in the alternative, affray. I do not accept that there is an evidentiary foundation for the jury to consider it and so do not propose to do so. My reasons are as follows.

2I will summarise the effect of what the evidence relevant to this issue is capable of establishing but it must be understood in the context of all of the events that were occurring at around the same time. 

3Briefly, there was mayhem in the Fowler Compound at the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre at about 11.00pm on 20 April 2011. There were detainees camped on the roof of the Macquarie Building, some of whom were pulling up roof tiles and some of them, and others, were throwing them. The Crown contends that they were being thrown ""willy-nilly"" but also at buildings, phone booths and members of staff. Other detainees were dragging objects onto the soccer field where a large bonfire was set. A substantial amount of yelling and shouting was going on, including detainees chanting ""freedom"". The Crown contends that a riot was occurring.

4The events which specifically relate to the present issue are the dragging of rubbish bins onto the soccer field which were used to establish, or further fuel, the bonfire; the spraying of fire extinguishers into the air and at staff; and the dismantling of soccer goal posts.

5The evidence relevant to this issue is capable of establishing the following:



Mr Ali was involved in dismantling soccer posts.
 
He held one above his head, moved a short distance towards other clients who were involved in moving bins and then threw it on the ground. There were no staff members in the vicinity.
 
He could have been ""running slightly"" when doing this.
 
He appeared to a staff member to be doing this in a ""menacing manner"". (This proposition was drawn out in cross-examination but counsel for the accused did not then attempt to explore what it was about the ""manner"" that was ""menacing"").
 
Mr Ali did not reach the group with the bins; he put the pole on the ground without attacking anyone and then moved away from the area.


It was ""possible"" that he picked up a segment of a soccer post, raised it above his head and went in the direction of a particular detainee who was spraying a fire extinguisher and others who had wheelie bins.


At 11.04pm, second-hand information was relayed to the ""command suite"" by an officer in the Fowler Compound which was recorded to the effect that there were two detainees fighting, one of who had a fire extinguisher and the other was swinging at him with a pole.

6For self-defence to be available for consideration by the jury, the evidence must be capable of establishing a reasonable possibility that (a) Mr Ali believed on reasonable grounds that it was necessary to do what he did in defence of himself, or in defence of property, and (b) what he did was a reasonable response in the circumstances as he perceived those circumstances: s 418 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Acting in defence of another is further basis upon which a self-defence issue can arise but it is only the two bases I have mentioned that have been suggested.

7Mr Ali did not give evidence. There is, accordingly, no direct evidence as to his belief as to the matters I have referred to in (a) in the preceding paragraph. However, it was submitted by Mr Paish that there was a sufficient evidentiary foundation for the jury to draw the inference that he did have either of those beliefs.

8Mr Paish referred in submissions to Pemble v The Queen [1971] HCA 20; 124 CLR 107, Zecevic v DPP (Vic) [1987] HCA 26; (1987) 162 CLR 645 and Douglas v R [2005] NSWCCA 419 in support of the proposition that once the evidence discloses the possibility that the accused acted in self-defence, the question must be left to the jury. I accept that submission. Mr Paish also submitted that when Mr Ali was approaching other detainees in a ""menacing manner"" it could be inferred that he was remonstrating violently with them because they were damaging government property. But for the following reasons, I do not think that the evidence leaves open any possibility for a reasonable jury to conclude that the defence is available.

9There is no evidence that detainees were physically attacking, or threatening to attack, other detainees. How the jury could possibly conclude that Mr Ali believed that detainees bringing rubbish bins onto the soccer field, and another detainee was spraying a fire extinguisher into the air, were threatening violence to him such that he believed it was necessary to do what he did in self-defence is mystifying. There is no prospect that the jury could regard that as a reasonable possibility.

10There is no evidence that any of the detainees, let alone Mr Ali, were so motivated to protect government property that they were motivated to threaten violence to those who were causing damage. The only evidence before the jury is that some of the detainees were damaging property, others were supporting them by shouting, yelling and chanting, whilst others either looked on or removed themselves from the mayhem. There is no basis for the jury to think that it was a reasonable possibility that Mr Ali, alone, was motivated by the good intention of protecting the property of the Australian government; particularly, but not only, because at most he is said to have advanced towards others with a bar raised above his head and then dropped it and wandered off.

11In addition, in my view, putting an entirely unmeritorious issue of self-defence to the jury as part of a fanciful defence advocated on the part of Mr Ali would, as the Crown Prosecutor observed, work to his disadvantage as opposed to serving his interests. As I commented during the course of submissions on 8 April 2013 (SU 89.10), there is a risk that it would simply cause the jury to think that Mr Ali's defence was ""silly"" and might prejudice them against a proper consideration of the case for and against him.

2706944,R v Abdollahi (No 10) [2013] NSWSC 483,"Judgment
1HIS HONOUR:  We are now at a point in this trial where the Crown case has concluded, I have dealt with applications for directed verdicts for some accused, defences cases have been presented, and we are part of the way through hearing defence counsels' closing addresses.  Mr Little, counsel for the accused Shahsawari, now makes an application for a directed verdict in respect of his client.
2The jury are waiting patiently in the jury room for the continuation of the address by counsel for another accused.  It is Easter Thursday and we are only sitting until 1:00pm.  For those reasons, whilst I have carefully considered what has been put by Mr Little.  I propose to give my reasons for refusing the application quite briefly.
3Taking the Crown case at its highest, in accordance with well-accepted principles in this area, Mr Little has extracted in written submissions a passage of evidence given by Ms Bishop appearing in the transcript at pages 900 and 902.  In my view that evidence has to be considered together with evidence given by Ms Bishop at pages 871 to 872 and pages 874 and 875.  In my view, whilst it cannot be said that the Crown case in respect of the accused Shahsawari is a strong one, there is just enough to make out the elements of the offences charged. 
4In my view there is sufficient evidence for the matter to be considered by the jury.  What they make of it is beside the point.  The application is refused.

2706964,R v Leung [2013] NSWSC 259,"ReMARKs ON SENTENCE 

1HIS HONOUR: Philip Wan Por Leung has been found guilty by a jury of the manslaughter of his partner, Mario Guzetti, on 7 April 2007. 

2The maximum penalty for the crime of manslaughter is imprisonment for 25 years. 

3It is my duty to determine the facts relevant to sentencing the offender. My view of the facts must be consistent with the verdict of the jury and the findings of fact I make against the offender must be arrived at beyond reasonable doubt: R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374. Matters of mitigation may be proved on the balance of probabilities: R v Pilley (1991) 56 A Crim R 202. 

4During the trial and proceedings on sentence, Mr M Hobart SC appeared for the Crown and Mr W Terracini SC appeared for the offender. 

5The offender and the deceased were in a homosexual domestic relationship and lived in a two story terrace dwelling at Alexandria. The dwelling was jointly owned by them. They had been in the relationship for about four years. The dwelling shared a common wall, with the adjoining premises that was occupied by Fiona Cunney and her family. 

6About a month before his death, the deceased told Giovanni De Francesca, a friend, that his relationship with the offender was detiorating and he wanted to end it. He said that the offender was becoming aggressive and he was frightened of him. 

7On 6 April 2007, the deceased spoke to Raymond Carter, who was a friend of both the deceased and the offender. The deceased said that he had argued with the offender who had stormed off. 

8At about 8.15am on 7 April 2007, Mrs Cunney heard noises which she described as ""crashing noises, like a shelf falling with pots and pans on it"" and what sounded ""like pan lids continuing to roll around"", emanating from next door (T187). Mrs Cunney thought she then heard the deceased singing which lasted for about ten seconds. About ten minutes later, she heard the offender screaming and crying. She said that the crying continued, until an ambulance arrived. 

9About this time, Guiseppa Di Franscesca telephoned the landline at the dwelling. The offender answered the telephone, crying. Mrs Di Francesca attempted to speak with the offender but he was incoherent. Believing something had happened at the dwelling, Mrs Di Francesca contacted her husband Giovanni by telephone. Mr Di Francesca arrived at the house and approached the front door. He could see the offender sitting at the end of the hallway with a pillow in his lap cradling the head of the deceased. The deceased's head was closest to the front door and his feet nearest the kitchen. 

10Mr Di Francesca entered the dwelling. The deceased appeared to be dead. He described the offender as hysterical and observed him sitting with the deceased's body screaming (T308): 

""Mario, Mario, come back, Mario don't leave me. Mario, Mario come back, wake up Mario.""

11Upon leaving the dwelling, Mr Di Francesca asked his daughter Laura to ring triple 0. Laura was informed by the triple 0 operator that a call had already been placed and an ambulance should be there soon. 

12The offender had made a triple 0 call at 9.12.53am during which he said ""I have a fight with my friend and my friend dead"" (T419).

13When ambulance officers Lawrence Agars and Vijay Kaza entered the dwelling, they saw the offender sitting at the bottom of the stairs with his back to the front door. The deceased was laying on his back with his head elevated on a pillow in the offender's lap. The offender was rocking the deceased's head from side to side. He was crying hysterically and had to be moved away from the deceased. 

14The ambulance officers observed that the deceased had a cross-shaped laceration on his right jaw. Mr Kaza noticed that the offender had blood on his hands, arms, and on his clothes. Mr Agars said that when the pillow was moved away from the deceased's head there was blood on it. He described seeing a small metal pot with a spout near the deceased's legs. 

15The ambulance officers attempted to resuscitate the deceased, but stopped at about 9.46am when the ECG showed no heart activity. 

16Police arrived shortly before the resuscitation attempt ceased and Senior Constable Simpkins assisted the ambulance officers with CPR. The police had found the offender about a metre from the deceased crying hysterically. He had stains on his shirt and hands that appeared to be blood. He was restrained. When the ambulance officers stopped CPR, the offender repeatedly said ""Help my friend, they're not helping him!"" (T60) He became increasingly agitated and tried to move towards the deceased. He was handcuffed so he would not contaminate the scene. The offender was taken by police to Redfern Police Station. Before entering the police vehicle and after being cautioned, the offender told police that he wanted his medication for depression. The offender was asked by Senior Constable Simpkins ""what happened this morning?"" to which he replied ""we had a fight"" (T64). When asked by the police officer ""what was the fight about?"", the offender answered ""I want my medication"" and made no further reply (T64). 

17The offender had a conversation at the police station with Raymond Carter. Mr Carter described the offender as crying hysterically and repeating that Mario, the deceased, was not dead. When told by Mr Carter that the deceased was dead and that the police needed to know what happened, the offender said (T 163):

""We had an argument ...I was making carrot juice with the juicer, Mario kept at me.""

18Mr Carter gave evidence that the offender started crying and sobbing even more. The offender said something about the juicer but Mr Carter could not make out the exact words that were said. The offender then said ""I was holding Mario"" (T163). 

19In the interview room, at about 3.30pm, Detective Hamill cautioned the offender and told him he was under arrest. The offender said (T315): 

""He is not dead. He is only in hospital. I didn't kill or murder him.""

Detective Hamill said:

""No Mario's dead. Can you tell me what happened?"" 

The offender replied:

""I don't remember. We have breakfast. Mario argue with me. He criticise me a lot. Oh Philip, then my head started spinning but I don't know what happened.""

20The offender declined to enter into a record of interview. He did not give evidence during the trial. 

21Inspector Thompson who had entered the kitchen of the dwelling at about 10am noticed that there was gyprock or white paint on the kitchen floor. 

22Detective Griffin, a crime scene examiner, attended the premises at about 1.28pm. His observations included seeing a disassembled fruit juicer on the kitchen sink area, the plastic container of which appeared to contain carrot pulp. In the kitchen garbage bin was what appeared to be further carrot pulp. He observed a portion of brickwork and render was missing from the western wall above the doorway. The damage appeared to him to be fresh, as there was orange coloured staining near the damage that appeared to be wet carrot pulp. 

23Detective Griffin said that the deceased's body was located at the base of the stairs. The deceased was laying on his back with his feet to the east and the juicer container (trial ex D) was in close proximity to him. The indentation in the kitchen wall was consistent with an object (such as the juicer container) being thrown at the kitchen wall. 

24An open white painted doorway was adjacent to the deceased's head. Located on both of the vertical sides of the doorway and on a portion of the northern wall was staining that appeared to be blood. This was later confirmed to be the deceased's blood. 

25Detective Griffin located a blood smear along the staircase handrail that was approximately 1½ metres off the ground. The blood smear tested positive for blood but DNA testing was unsuccessful. 

26The DNA of the deceased was found on the juicer container as was a fingerprint of the offender.

27An autopsy was conducted by Dr Botterill, who considered that the cause of death was most probably the consequence of head injury. He identified 16 specific injuries. Dr Botterill examined the deceased's brain which showed changes consistent with blunt force head injury. Dr Botterill's findings as to the deceased's brain were confirmed by Dr Michael Rodriguez, a Neuropathologist. Dr Botterill was of the opinion that, although any of the individual injuries might be associated with a simple fall, the extent of distribution of the injuries was more in keeping with multiple blunt force contacts. He opined that it was possible that the neck bruising and chest injuries were related to the application of force to the neck, but no discrete ligature marks or eyeball haemorrhages were identified.

28Dr Botterill went to the dwelling and inspected the stairs. He was of the opinion that the extent of the injuries to the front of the chest, the neck and over the head would not be occasioned by a simple fall down the six lower steps from the landing. As to a fall from the top of the stairs, he said that he could not recall in any case that he had been associated with anybody having a fall of that complexity. In relation to the position where the deceased was found, Dr Botterill said (T226):

""I don't believe it is possible to fall down the stairs and be in a position as seen in that photograph.""

29Dr Botterill gave evidence that the features of the wound to the deceased's chin were not specific enough to enable him to say that the wound must have necessarily been caused by the spout of the juicer container, but that was a possible explanation. The wound itself may have been the result of one or more blows to the same area. He said that it was certainly possible that the injury to the inside of the mouth could have been occasioned by force being applied by the juicer container. The injury to both sides of the head, the blood over the surfaces of the brain, and the bruising to the deeper part of the brain seen by Dr Rodriguez were consistent with a fall by the deceased onto the back of his head. They were also consistent with the deceased, after being struck by the juicer container which caused injury to the mouth, falling over and hitting his head on a wall and the floor. 

30The Crown case at trial was that the offender struck the deceased with the juicer container not only once but several times causing him to fall over and hit his head causing brain damage, that the offender tried to strangle the deceased and also struck and beat him with the juicer container in the chest area. The Crown put to the jury that the cross-shaped laceration to the right jaw was caused by the offender striking the deceased more than once in that area, causing the wound to become more complex and blood to spatter behind him. It was the Crown case that those acts of the offender, in combination, caused the deceased's death and that those acts were deliberate, unlawful, and dangerous. 

31Professor Duflou and Professor Hilton gave evidence in the offender's case. Professor Duflou did not think that the deceased had been strangled. He said that he would be extremely hesitant to even raise the possibility of a strangulation in the absence of petechial haemorrhages and in the absence of injury to the bony structures of the neck. He believed that the cause of death was most likely to be head injury. There was brain damage and there had been a couple of impacts to the head. The head injury was a blunt force type injury of a diffuse nature. Professor Duflou said that he did not know how that injury was caused.

32Professor Duflou testified that the injury to the deceased's chin could have been caused by coming into contact with the solid wooden bollard at the end of the staircase. He explained that falls down stairs are invariably complex and are not a straight-forward single fall. He said that there can be multiple interactions with surfaces. Professor Duflou opined that the injuries to the back of the deceased's head could have been caused by the fall. He expressed the opinion that the grazes and bruises in the chest area could be the result of being struck or scratched in that area, possibly the clothing pulled or it could be an attempt at resuscitation, certainly not expert resuscitation by any stretch of the imagination. 

33Professor Hilton expressed the opinion that the cause of the deceased's death was unclear. He was concerned about the possibility of heart attack being an explanation for the death. He did not consider that the cause of death was strangulation. Professor Hilton opined that the injuries to the deceased's head could have been caused by the head impacting the solid timber structure of the staircase. He said that a simple fall, unless it was against some object, would not support the entire complex of bruising on the lower neck and upper chest of the deceased. However, he would not say that these injuries were absolutely inconsistent with a fall. 

34By their verdict, the jury rejected as a reasonable possibility that the deceased's death was not caused by an act of the offender but by a fall down the stairs, or because of a heart attack or other cardiac event, or by any other cause. The jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that following an argument with the deceased, when the offender had been making carrot juice, the offender in anger attacked him and caused his death and that the offender's acts were deliberate, unlawful, and dangerous. 

35The crime of manslaughter has always been recognised by the law as a most serious crime: R v Hill (1981) 3 A Crim R 397 at 402. The value, which the community places upon the preservation of human life, is reflected by the need to have the conduct denounced by a sentence appropriate to the circumstances of the case: R v Macdonald (unrep, NSWCCA 12 December 1995). The starting point in the present sentencing exercise as in all offences of manslaughter is that the life of Mario Guzetti has been unlawfully taken: R v Blacklidge (unrep, NSWCCA 12 December 1995). 

36The Crown invites me to find that the offender struck the deceased severely in the area of the chin, with the juicer container, and then at least one further time in the region of the face; that he also struck the deceased several times on the chest area; that he also caused injury to the deceased's neck region, leaving severe neck bruising; and the deceased fell backwards, injuring the back of his head and causing brain damage. The Crown contends that this case was far more serious than where death was caused by a single punch, as there was a sustained attack on the deceased. 

37Mr Terracini submits that the precise foundation of the jury's verdict is unknown and it would be difficult for the court to make precise findings such as the number of blows and precise cause of death. Mr Terracini put to me that the finding that could be made ""is that there was an attack upon the deceased and that as a result of that attack he died in circumstances where there was obviously ...an aggressive attack"" (TOS 11). I am unable to accept this submission. 

38I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender struck the deceased with the juicer container in the area of the chin and mouth causing him to fall onto the back of his head causing brain injury and death. Consistent with the jury's verdict, there is no other rational explanation for the wound to the deceased's chin. 

39I reject the contention that was advanced for the offender during the trial that the injuries to the deceased's chest area could have been caused by vigorous attempts by the ambulance officers and Senior Constable Simpkins to resuscitate the deceased. All of these officers were trained to perform CPR and Professor Duflou did not think that the grazes and bruises to the chest area could be the result of expert resuscitation. There is no evidence that the offender attempted to resuscitate the deceased. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender struck the deceased with the juicer container several times to the chest area, causing the multiple curved and relatively straight grazed areas of bruising identified by Dr Botterill as injury number 8. 

40The Crown has not established to the criminal standard that the offender attempted to strangle the deceased as there was absence of injury to the bony structures of the neck and of petechial haemorrhages. I do not find that the offender depressed the deceased's vagal nerve in the carotid artery causing vagal inhibition. 

41This was a violent attack carried out in anger by the offender upon his 71 year old partner and exposed the deceased to a high risk of serious injury. It is an objectively serious offence of manslaughter. 

42Consistent with his plea, the offender has neither expressed remorse or shown contrition for the offence. His sentence is not to be increased for that, but no allowance in mitigation can be made for remorse or contrition. 

43I take into account as a mitigating factor that the offender does not have a record of previous convictions: s 21A(3)(e) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. He was born on 1 August 1960 and was 46 years old when the offence was committed and is now 52 years old. The offender's personal background, to which I refer at [47] - [49] below, discloses the industry that he displayed in establishing himself in Australia, notwithstanding his challenging childhood in China and Hong Kong. Mr Carter and Ronald Johnson gave evidence during the trial of the offender's good character and written character testimonials from them were tendered during the proceedings on sentence. I accept that the offender was a person of good character, which is a mitigating factor: s 21A(3)(f) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.

44Although the offender has not expressed remorse, his lack of previous convictions and good character strongly suggest that he is unlikely to re-offend and has good prospects of rehabilitation. I consider that the offender is unlikely to re-offend and has good prospects of rehabilitation, which are mitigating factors: s 21A(3)(g)-(h) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 

45Accordingly, personal deterrence does not have a significant role to play in my sentencing task. However, there is to be a measure of general deterrence in the sentence. 

46Another mitigating factor is that the offence was not planned, but was committed impulsively following the argument: s 21A(3)(b) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.

47The offender did not give evidence during the proceedings on sentence. His subjective circumstances are drawn from the history provided to Dr Jonathon Adams, a psychiatrist, which is detailed in the report dated 5 March 2013 (ex 1). The offender was born in Shenzhen China and attended school between age 8 and 14 years. Following his mother's death when he was 14 years old, he escaped to Hong Kong to join his father, who he had not previously seen. His father wanted him to be a mechanic, which he did for approximately two weeks. He stopped working as a mechanic, which angered his father and the offender ran away from home. The offender began an apprenticeship in ivory carving, studied English at night and supported himself until he moved to New Zealand in 1984. He was employed carving Jade for approximately four years prior to moving to Sydney. 

48The offender was employed by different jewellery companies in Sydney prior to beginning his own jewellery business in 1994. He continued to run his own business until he was assaulted and stabbed on 11 June 2005, which resulted in the loss of his left eye, nerve damage, and back pain. The offender described a deterioration of his mental health after the assault, that he was depressed and antidepressant medication was prescribed. His mental health improved after six to seven months, which the offender attributed to the deceased's support. He has been in receipt of a disability support pension and has not returned to paid employment after the assault. 

49The offender and the deceased had resided together from 2003 onwards. He told Dr Adams that their relationship was ""very happy"" and made frequent reference to the deceased as being his primary support person (ex 1 p5). 

50The offender related to Dr Adams that his mental health deteriorated following the death of the deceased and being charged. Antidepressant medication was continued whilst he was incarcerated. He reported his mood state when he was released from custody as generally being ""no good at all"" (ex 1 p6). He described marked fluctuations of mood over the last five years, with periods lasting several months during which he felt ""depressed...terrible"" (ex 1 p6). He linked his worst periods of mood to the periods leading up to and ""during the two trials he went through"" (ex 1 p6). During these periods, he described a worsening sleep pattern, energy deterioration, lower motivation, concentration impairment and intrusive ruminating negative cognitions. He began to ""self medicate"" (ex 1 p6) with increasing use of alcohol and illicit substances, but after six months he used alcohol less frequently. The offender described how on the two occasions he was acquitted his mood improved briefly, and how his emotional state rapidly deteriorated when he learnt of the appeals. His level of functioning over the years had ""just"" been living ""day by day"" (ex 1 p6).

51Dr Adams reported that the offender told him that he had remained compliant with anti-depressant medication and had been seeing a psychologist in Redfern on a regular basis. When he went into custody the offender was initially prescribed antidepressant medication, but he decided to stop taking his medication a few months ago. 

52Dr Adams expressed the opinion (at ex 1 p9) that ""the description [the offender] gave of experiencing recurrent sustained periods of low mood (concurrent with disturbance of sleep, appetite, energy, concentration, motivation, and enjoyment of activities), anxious ruminations, and ideas of suicide, is in keeping with recurrent episodes of major depression. The account [the offender] provided portrayed a nexus between his periods of low mood and the recurring legal proceedings (two previous trials and two previous appeals)."" Dr Adams was concerned that the offender had ceased antidepressant medication. He opined that the offender would benefit from psychiatric review and follow up and that consideration should be given to the reintroduction of antidepressant medication. 

53During oral submissions, Mr Terracini told me that Dr Adam's report disclosed ""no recognised psychiatric illness"" (TOS 5). Dr Adam's report, however, does reveal the offender's depression following the assault in 2005 and the impact the tortuous course of the criminal proceedings has had upon him. 

54A short history of the proceedings is as follows; On 4 May 2009, Rothman J directed the jury to return a verdict of not guilty to murder and manslaughter: R v Leung (No3) [2009] NSWSC 450. A new trial was ordered by the Court of Criminal Appeal on the charge of manslaughter on 8 October 2009, but the acquittal on the charge of murder was affirmed: R v PL [2009] NSWCCA 256; (2009) 199 A Crim R 199. Adams J directed a verdict of acquittal on the charge of manslaughter on 28 April 2011: R v Leung [2011] NSWSC 785. On 20 March 2012, the Court of Criminal Appeal quashed the acquittal and ordered a new trial: R v PL [2012] NSWCCA 31. On 14 November 2012, the jury was empanelled and a verdict of guilty was returned on 28 November 2012. The offender was found guilty of manslaughter at his third trial. 

55The applicant was in custody until conditional bail with triweekly reporting conditions was granted on 7 August 2007. A further grant of conditional bail with once weekly reporting was granted on 20 March 2012. 

56It is hardly surprising that the fluctuating outcomes of directed acquittals at trial and reversal upon appeal have had an adverse psychological effect on the offender. The offender has been left in uncertain suspense for almost six years. Furthermore, throughout much of this time, his liberty has been restricted by bail conditions. Notwithstanding the offender's pleas of not guilty, I do not think that the delay can be attributed to him. There are many cases that deal with delay, as a mitigating circumstance: see for example Hancock v R [2012] NSWCCA 200 [23]; R v Khanas (1999) 108 A Crim R 499; Mill v R (1988) 166 CLR 59, but it seems to me that the present circumstances are unique as the delay was associated with the emotional highs of two favourable trial outcomes and disappointment in the results of the appeals by the Crown to the Court of Criminal Appeal. However, it is important to observe that the Crown was not entirely successful on appeal, the verdict of not guilty to the most serious charge of murder being affirmed. Given the history of the proceedings and adverse psychological impact upon the offender, considerations of fairness call for leniency being extended to him, which I propose to reflect in a finding of special circumstances, justifying a variation between the non-parole period and the balance of the term of sentence. 

57I further find as special circumstances, his physical disability and need for psychiatric review and treatment. 

58Enzo Guzzetti the deceased's brother read a victim impact statement to the court. The contents of the statement cannot be used by me to increase the offender's sentence: R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76. I acknowledge the grief and distress of the deceased's relations and express on the community's behalf its sympathy and compassion for them. 

59Mr Terracini drew my attention to Judicial Commission sentencing statistics for offences of manslaughter (ex 3) but the limited use that may be made of these statistics is further diminished by the wide embrace of offending that might amount to the crime of manslaughter: R v Woodland [2001] NSWSC 416 at [27] - [30]. In written submissions, Mr Crown referred to various cases. Although I have found all of this material to be of assistance, each case depends on its own facts. 

60Having considered all possible alternatives, I am satisfied that no sentence other than full time imprisonment is appropriate. The parties agree that at the time of the proceedings on sentence, the offender had spent a total of seven months and 14 days in custody. Twenty days have elapsed from proceedings on sentence, which is to be added to the time he has been in custody. Accordingly, his sentence will be backdated to commence on 26 July 2012. 

61Philip Wan Por Leung for the offence of manslaughter, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of 8 years with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months which is to commence on 26 July 2012 and is to expire on 25 January 2017. I set a balance of term of 3 years 6 months which is to commence on 26 January 2017 and will expire on 25 July 2020. 

62The earliest date of eligibility for your release to parole is 25 January 2017.

		28 March 2013",2013-03-27 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2706970,"R v MEYN, John Michael (No 6) [2013] NSWSC 243","Judgment

1On 19 November 2012 John Michael Meyn was arraigned before me on an indictment that charged that he on 8 April 2011, at Colyton, did murder Yvette Rathbone. At the time of her death, Ms Rathbone was his former de facto partner, and the mother of their two young children. 

2The trial proceeded but for reasons that are unnecessary to describe the jury had to be discharged. On 28 November 2012 the offender was again arraigned before me and entered a plea of not guilty. The trial then proceeded to a verdict. On 14 December 2012, the jury returned a verdict of guilty to the charge of murder. 

3On 8 March 2013 I heard submissions on behalf of the offender and the Crown on sentence. 

4At the outset I note that it was not submitted by the Crown that I should impose the maximum penalty of life imprisonment (Crimes Act 1900, s 19A). I am required to impose a life sentence if I am satisfied that the level of culpability involved in the commission of the offence was so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that form of sentence (Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, ""the Sentencing Act"", s 61(1)). This is not such a case. 

5Pursuant to s 54A of the Sentencing Act the standard non-parole period for the offence of murder is twenty years. The Sentencing Act does not require me to undertake the sentencing exercise by treating the non-parole period as the necessary starting point or the end point in fixing the sentence (Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [17]). Nor am I required to commence by asking whether there are reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period in this case (Muldrock at [25]). Instead, I am required to bear in mind those two legislative guideposts. I am required to identify all the factors relevant to the sentence, discuss their significance and then determine the appropriate sentence (Muldrock at [26], citing Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [51] per McHugh J).

Background

6The following is taken from the evidence led at the trial. It includes some parts of the offender's evidence at the trial. Unless otherwise stated, the evidence was not disputed.

7The offender met Ms Rathbone sometime in 2005 or 2006. Within a few months she had moved into the offender's home. At that time the offender lived in a converted garage at the rear of his parents' home. They lived in that garage before moving to various other premises. There were two boys born of their relationship, Taylor born in xxxx 2008 and Robbie born in xxxx 2010. The relationship broke up in late 2010 to early 2011 while they were living at Rooty Hill and during a period in which the offender was not working. The offender returned to living in the converted garage and returned to work as a truck driver and forklift operator. Ms Rathbone stayed at the Rooty Hill residence with Taylor and Robbie. 

8The offender described the initial period of their separation as amicable. He stated that despite their separation he and Ms Rathbone had sex once or twice per week. He stated that during this time they had an informal agreement whereby Taylor stayed with him in his converted garage one or two nights per week. The offender stated that he had little contact with his youngest son, Robbie, because ""[h]e was only a baby"".

9After a period, relations between the offender and Ms Rathbone deteriorated. There were a number of instances of conflict between them that were the subject of the evidence adduced in the trial, although the Crown and the offender relied on them for different purposes.

10On 31 March 2011 they quarrelled on the telephone about some parcels the offender arranged to have delivered to Ms Rathbone's home. The offender went to her house to pick up the parcels. According to the offender the visit descended into an argument about the parcels and about an exchange of text messages that had occurred earlier in the day. In one of those text messages the offender had said to Ms Rathbone ""you just have the kids"". The offender stated that he regretted sending the text message and asked her to delete it. He said that she refused and threatened to show the text message to their children. At some point the offender told Ms Rathbone that he would report her to Centrelink for residing with him while receiving a supporting pension.

11The argument that ensued culminated in the offender smashing Ms Rathbone's phone. Ms Rathbone responded by damaging his car, and the offender said he damaged her car in retaliation. 

12After this incident Ms Rathbone replaced her mobile phone. She did not give her new telephone number to the offender, however he was still able to contact her via email.

13The offender did not see Ms Rathbone again until 5 April 2011. He went to her home at around 3am, demanding to see his children. The offender explained that the cause of the visit was his anxiety over a nightmare that he had in which their eldest son had been poisoned. Ms Rathbone refused him entry and threatened to call the police. Following that, the offender sent a series of facebook messages to Ms Rathbone's landlady threatening to report her and Ms Rathbone to Centrelink. 

14The offender next saw Ms Rathbone on the evening of 7 April 2011. During that day they exchanged very friendly emails. It was arranged for Ms Rathbone and the two boys to visit the offender in the evening after work. 

15The offender returned home from work at approximately 8pm on 7 April 2011. Shortly afterwards Ms Rathbone and their children arrived. They left after half an hour. One of the reasons they arranged to meet that night was to have sex, but that did not eventuate. 

16The offender asserted that he did not eat on 7 April 2011, but instead consumed a large amount of alcohol from the time he returned home from work at 8pm until 3am the following morning when he went to sleep. I discuss the state of his intoxication later (at [44]). 

17Early the next morning the offender was woken by his mother. After waking he telephoned his employer at 6.25am and told him that he would not be coming in to work that day. He said that he decided not to go to work because he thought he was ""over the limit"". He said that he kept drinking throughout the morning. 

18From 7.30am the offender and Ms Rathbone emailed and telephoned each other. Following those exchanges she and Robbie went to the converted garage. In cross examination it was suggested to the offender that he and Ms Rathbone had arranged on the evening of 7 April 2008 to meet up again the following morning and have sex. The offender denied this, saying that they had arranged to meet up after his work when she would hand over the children, and he would look after them for the remainder of the weekend. The offender said that Ms Rathbone only came over that morning following those emails and telephone conversations. I accept that evidence. It is supported by an email bearing the time 10.03am but probably sent at 9.03am from the offender to Ms Rathbone stating ""I'm home today; come over with Robbie"". Taylor had been dropped at childcare shortly after 9am. 

19The offender said that Ms Rathbone and Robbie arrived at 9.30am. Shortly after 10.30am they all walked to a nearby store. They were seen by a local shopkeeper.

20It was the Crown case that at some time after leaving the store, between 10.30am and 12.30pm on 8 April 2011, the offender bashed and strangled Ms Rathbone. 

21He was next sighted at approximately 12.30pm leaving Ms Rathbone's home. In his evidence he said he went there to get a bottle of milk for Robbie. At 12.53pm, Ms Rathbone's neighbour, Mr Spencer Da Palma, received a text message from her mobile phone number which read ""call me"". Mr Da Palma called her mobile phone number. The offender answered and asked him ""What is going on between you and Yvette?"" Mr Da Palma replied ""Nothing, nothing is going on"". Later the offender rang him again from his own mobile phone, repeated the question and asked why his number was on Ms Rathbone's phone.

22The offender also attempted to call his mother. He made three calls at around 1pm. He then drove to ANZ's St Marys branch. At 1.23pm he withdrew approximately $8,500.00 from his savings account.

23At 1.50pm the offender spoke with his mother on his mobile phone. He asked her to go home. She asked ""What's the matter?"" He replied ""I'll tell you when you come home. I'm sorry. You won't like it. I'm sorry"". She again asked what the matter was. He said ""I'm sorry, I will tell you when you get here. I can't tell you on the phone"". The offender then drove to Taylor's preschool and signed his son out shortly before 2pm.

24The offender drove westwards towards the Glenbrook National Park. At around 3pm the offender purchased some beer from a liquor shop in Blaxland. 

25In the meantime his mother had returned home. She did not find any one in the house. She went to the converted garage. She found Ms Rathbone's body lying on the floor parallel to the bed. She called her daughter to tell her what she had found. Her daughter called the police. At about 2pm two police officers arrived at the house. They found Ms Rathbone's body. There was a blanket over the lower part of her body and a pillow over her head. She was naked underneath the blanket. While the police were at the scene the offender rang his mother again. He said ""I'm sorry, mum, can you look after the kids? I want to spend as much time as possible with them before I hand myself in to the police"". He assured her the children were safe.

26The offender then continued driving to the Glenbrook National Park. Apparently he and his friends rode their bikes there when they were children. He parked and walked with the children to the lookout at Mount Portal. At around 4.30pm the offender called his long-time friend, Mr Benjamin Deller. Mr Deller said the offender was hysterical, could not get full sentences out and was very upset. He recalled him stating that he had killed Ms Rathbone and that he was apologetic and saying ""she didn't deserve it"". Mr Deller also said that the offender stated ""he just strangled her, there wasn't a fight, there were happy moments before it, yeah"". In his evidence the offender agreed that he told Mr Deller ""I've killed Yvette"" over and over and that ""I think I have strangled her"". He said he remembered seeing marks around her neck before he left the scene.

27After this call, the offender's brother called him and the offender told him ""[s]he didn't deserve what I've done"". Around the time of this call, at 4.38pm, a police helicopter began circling above the lookout. The helicopter filmed the offender and his two children standing on the viewing deck. 

28The police arrived soon afterwards. They approached the offender. He was drinking a stubby of beer. After a short discussion the offender handed the two children over to police. At approximately 4.45pm he was arrested and taken to Penrith Police Station. He was interviewed in three sessions beginning at 7.36pm on 8 April 2011 and concluding at 3.23am on 9 April 2011. He was then charged.

29In R v Meyn (No 1) [2012] NSWSC 1441 (""Meyn (No 1)"") I rejected a challenge to the admissibility of the offender's interviews with the police which was based on an assertion that the police had persisted in interviewing him, knowing that or reckless as to whether he was too intoxicated or exhausted to participate. I outlined the circumstances of that interview in Meyn (No 1) at [12] to [55]. I will not repeat them here. It suffices to state that in the first session the offender told the investigating officers that after Ms Rathbone came to the garage they put Robbie to sleep and had sex (A244). He said that after they had sex and while she was dressing he asked her ""how she was goin[g] on PlentyofFish"" which he said angered her (A248). ""PentyofFish"" is an internet dating site. The offender had found out she was seeking to meet people on that site by using a ""dummy profile"" (ie posing as someone else). The offender initially stated that he could not remember what happened next (A258) and that the next thing he could recall was her lying on the floor (A259). However in the last session the offender stated that he recalled an argument and an altercation in which she bit his chest (A511). He was asked about the blood on Ms Rathbone's head and he said ""he might have hit her with something"" (A562) and that he ""might have choked her"" (A565) but that he ""didn't mean for her to die"" (A567).

Forensic Evidence

30The post mortem examination was conducted by Dr Orde. His examination revealed that Ms Rathbone suffered substantial bruising and fractures in the head and neck areas consistent with her being bashed and strangled. In particular, Dr Orde found substantial bruising or grazing over most of the head including the jaw region, near her left cheekbone and the temporal region. Dr Orde described the injuries to her eyes as ""devolving black eyes"". Dr Orde said the back of her head was sodden with blood because of ""two quite large and quite deep lacerations or tears to the scalp"". 

31Dr Orde's internal examination also revealed fracturing near the left eye socket caused by a blow to the eyelid. Dr Orde said Ms Rathbone had suffered bleeding around the brain. A neurologist found bruising and swelling to the brain which Dr Orde described as ""in keeping with the application of significant blunt force, likely by way of multiple blows to the head or the head striking hard objects several times"".

32Dr Orde also found substantial evidence that Ms Rathbone was strangled. He said the facial features were congested and engorged with blood, and that there were ""pinpoint haemorrhages within the linings of the eyes"", suggesting that the veins ""most probably in the neck, would have been obstructed by pressure"". Dr Orde noticed some bruising to the neck area and a bloodstain to the right ear canal. His internal examination found ""multifocal bruising to the muscles of the neck largely around the voice box"" and around the hyoid bone found at the base of the tongue. However this bone and the larynx were intact. 

33Ms Rathbone also suffered bruising to the wrists and upper arms as well as grazing and scratches to the hips and legs.

34Dr Orde concluded that the ""most likely"" explanation for her death was the ""combined effects of both the blunt force head injuries and the compression of the neck, leading to the element of asphyxiation"". In cross-examination by Counsel for the offender, Mr Chapple SC, Dr Orde accepted that it was possible that the trauma to the head of Ms Rathbone could have been caused by a hard fall or collision with objects in the room, and that the injuries in the neck region could have been caused by the ""application of hands around [Ms Rathbone's] neck but not to the extent they actually strangled her"". 

Issues at the trial and findings

35The Crown case was that, after the offender and Ms Rathbone had sex on the morning of 8 April 2011, the offender upset her by raising her use of ""PlentyofFish"" and her fears about Centrelink, which led to her becoming angry and him responding by bashing and strangling her. The Crown contended that an intention on his part to inflict death or grievous bodily harm could be inferred from the nature of the injuries he inflicted. 

36In his evidence the offender told the jury that after they had sex he made mention to Ms Rathbone of the web site ""PlentyofFish"" and said something that would have indicated to her that he had fooled her by communicating with her via a dummy profile. He said that this angered her and she became abusive. He said that he then asked her ""[h]ave you heard from Centrelink"". To this stage the Crown case and his case coincide, but from this point they differ. The offender said that Ms Rathbone became violent. He said that she attacked him in an extreme rage, hitting and biting him. He asserted that he simply shoved her to get away from her. He denied hitting her with any object and explained that the injuries she sustained probably occurred as a result of him pushing Ms Rathbone and her colliding with various pieces of furniture, or possibly hitting her head on the ground. He stated that at one point he held her down by the neck but only for a short period to restrain her.

37In support of his version the offender pointed to aspects of Ms Rathbone's conduct on the occasion in March 2011 noted previously (at [11]), as well as three other incidents. The first was around 2006 when the offender and Ms Rathbone visited Newcastle and stayed in a motor home. The offender said they were both drunk, argued, and that Ms Rathbone became violent and bit him. The second was around the same time when they were living in the converted garage. The offender said that during an argument she picked up a knife in his presence. He said he left the room. The third was an incident described by the partner of one of the offender's friends when a dog licked one of the children in the face at social gathering. Ms Rathbone was said to have become upset and left yelling. This incident only struck me as an example of her demonstrating parental anxiety. The other two incidents were more serious but they are well in the past and in each case the offender was able to leave her presence. 

38The offender's version of events put in issue two matters in relation to the offence of murder that the Crown had to negate. The first was whether he ever formed an intention to inflict death or grievous bodily harm. The second was whether he acted in self defence. In addition, the evidence of the offender's drinking raised an issue as to the degree of his intoxication and its ability to affect his capacity to form the requisite intention and alter his perception of events. The jury were instructed accordingly. Their verdict reflects their satisfaction to the appropriate standard that the Crown had proved he had the necessary intention, was not intoxicated to an extent that precluded him from forming that intention, and was not acting in self defence. In particular I am satisfied that the jury accepted that he bashed and strangled Ms Rathbone. He inflicted the harm upon her with at least his fists and possibly an object. He placed his hands around her neck and strangled her.

39The jury's verdict did not determine whether the offender intended to kill Ms Rathbone or only inflict grievous bodily harm. The Crown submitted that I should find the former established beyond reasonable doubt. Further, Mr Chapple SC correctly submitted that the jury's verdict does not necessarily mean that there was not some element of the offender defending himself in the lead up to the death of Ms Rathbone, or that he was not intoxicated to some degree. Those matters, if present, can be still called in aid to reduce the offender's culpability notwithstanding the jury's verdict (see R v Heffernan [2005] NSWSC 739 at [48] to [54] per Hoeben J as his Honour then was). 

40Thus there remain aspects of the offence that were not necessarily resolved by the jury's verdict and, to the extent that it is possible, it is necessary for me to resolve them so that the offender's criminality can be properly characterised. 

41The first two issues are whether the offender intended to inflict death or grievous bodily harm and whether there was any element of self defence in his conduct. 

42It is apparent from the events of that morning and those afterwards that the offence was clearly not premeditated. The attendance of the offender, Ms Rathbone and Robbie at the local shop prior to the offence and the offender's communications with his family and friends after the offence are completely inconsistent with some predetermined plan on his part to physically harm Ms Rathbone. Instead the offence erupted out of his needling of Ms Rathbone. A moment's thought reveals how cruel that conduct was. She was facing the reality of raising two young boys mostly by herself. She had just had sex with her ex-partner. He then mocked her efforts to move beyond their relationship by his reference to ""PlentyofFish"" and his dummy profile. He then caused her even greater anxiety about her future by his reference to Centrelink. The Crown opened on the basis that this provoked her to anger and the offender testified that it did. It would be surprising if it had not. A single mother was being tormented by an ex-partner who did not want be with her, but wanted her for sex, and was trying to stymie her efforts to live her own life and look after her children. 

43It is difficult to determine if Ms Rathbone's anger spilled over into violence. At the time of his ERISP the only injuries apparent on the offender were a bite mark and some minor bruising. They are equivocal. The bite mark could have been occasioned during sex and all the injuries may have been inflicted on the offender while Ms Rathbone was defending herself. Nevertheless given the nature of his taunts I accept that Ms Rathbone's anger may have led her to become abusive and possibly aggressive to a small extent. However, that is all. There was a discrepancy in her size compared with that of the appellant, and there were massive discrepancies in the injuries they suffered. There were few signs of a struggle in the converted garage. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, from a very early point in the confrontation, the offender's aggression dwarfed any aggressive conduct by Ms Rathbone. The violence that was inflicted upon her probably took place over a small period of time, but it was savage. Further, given the evidence as to her strangulation injuries, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, albeit for a brief period while he was in a fit of rage, he intended to kill her.

44As I have stated, the jury's verdict did not necessarily determine that the offender was not affected by any alcohol at the time he killed Ms Rathbone. I have referred to the evidence concerning the offender's alcohol consumption from the evening of 7 April 2011 until the time of his apprehension late in the afternoon of 8 April 2011 (at [16] to [17] and [28]). I accept that he consumed some alcohol but not the amount he claimed in his evidence or enough to affect his self control to any material degree although it may have made him slightly more aggressive. Neither the witness who saw him at the nearby shop that morning nor the witnesses who saw him in the afternoon observed him to be affected by alcohol. It is to be remembered that he collected his sons and drove a considerable distance to the lookout. 

45The offender's actions in the afternoon of 8 April 2012 are revealing as to the factors that motivated him. One of his first actions was to contact a male whose number was on Ms Rathbone's mobile phone and interrogate him as to whether he was seeing her. His desire for some form of control continued after he believed that he had killed her. However many of his calls to his family and friends reveal his genuine distress at the death of Ms Rathbone. Further his desperate drive west to the Glenbrook National Park involved him returning to a place he played at in his youth with his sons to spend his last hours with them before his incarceration for a long period.

Victim Impact Statements

46Victim impact statements were delivered by Ms Rathbone's mother Vivianne Hotson, her sister Valda Chalker and her stepmother Wendy Rathbone. Ms Hotson said that Ms Rathbone was not only her daughter but her close friend. They saw each other almost every day as she lived nearby. Since her daughter's death she has been unable to cope with everyday tasks and she has no desire to get up in the morning.

47Ms Chalker said that she and her sister were very close as they grew up and faced a difficult childhood together. She described her sister as a devoted mother to her sons, and said that Ms Rathbone ""adored them with all of her heart"". She said that Ms Rathbone wanted nothing more than to have a ""happy family life"". She described her as a generous and caring person. Ms Chalker feels emptiness and anger at the loss of her sister. As time has passed she has become increasingly bitter. Her relationships with her family and friends have suffered, as well as her drive and enthusiasm for work and life generally. Sadly, she finds herself often thinking of what her sister's last moments would have been like, and desperately hopes that she did not suffer from the injuries she sustained.

48Wendy Rathbone said that she had a role in helping raise Ms Rathbone from when she was six years old. She describes her as a shy but happy little girl with an ""enormous amount of love to give"". Like Ms Chalker, she describes Ms Rathbone's devotion to her sons. Wendy Rathbone also described the impact upon her husband, Ms Rathbone's father, of the loss of his daughter. She has observed him to become angry and depressed. She attempts to describe the depth of his pain. 

49Brian Rathbone was a witness at the trial. After his evidence was completed he observed the balance of the trial from the back of the Court. It was obvious from his presentation as a witness that his daughter's death and the events surrounding it have wounded him deeply. The trial would have been a searing experience for any father. The intimate details of his daughter's private life were laid open. There were repeated suggestions that at times she had been volatile and aggressive. These matters were raised because they were necessary for the consideration of the issues that arose at the trial, however that would not make them any easier for a parent to listen to. They certainly did not present anything close to a complete or even fair portrait of his daughter. That has been provided by Ms Hotson, Ms Chalker and Wendy Rathbone. 

50The two victims most profoundly affected by this crime are Taylor and Robbie. In the case of Robbie, it is unlikely that at present he has any real appreciation of what he has lost. Even for Taylor it will no doubt be many years before he appreciates the full extent of what has been taken from him. As time passes he and his brother will compare their lives to those of the children around him who have one or more parents. They will see parents helping and supporting their children with the little tasks, the very big, and the ones in between. Taylor and Robbie's position and the challenges for what remains of their family was best expressed by Wendy Rathbone in her victim impact statement:

""As for Taylor and Robbie I wonder what the future has in store for them and how do we answer their questions, especially when they ask 'what happened to Mummy' or 'how did Mummy die' and 'where is Daddy'. How do we answer these questions not wanting to see them upset? How do we do that?""

51The significance of victim impact statements was discussed in MAH v R [2006] NSWCCA 226 at [61] to [63] per Grove J, with Hidden and Kirby JJ agreeing. I am not to treat them as evidence which I can act on, or material which operates in aggravation of the offence, or as otherwise adverse to the offender. Nevertheless, the Court acknowledges the profound loss to Ms Rathbone's family, especially her sons, caused by her death at the hands of the offender.

The offender's personal history

52Tendered at the sentencing hearing was a report from a psychologist, Mr Mark Howard. Mr Howard's report conveniently summarised aspects of the offender's background and addressed a number of issues concerning his present functioning. As I will explain some aspects of the report are predicated on a version of events that was rejected by the jury.

53The offender was born on 1 May 1978. He was 32 years old at the time he committed the offence and is currently 34. He is the third eldest of four children. Mr Howard described him as having a stable upbringing. The evidence at the trial suggested that he had and maintains a supportive family.

54The offender attended primary and secondary school and completed Year 10. His educational performance was described as being slightly below average in core subjects, although he excelled in practical subjects. Generally he appeared to have a good work history and a reasonably strong work ethic. While he was at school he worked in retail and at his father's boat mechanics business on a casual basis. After he left school he was employed in furniture polishing and cabinet-making for two to three years. In his early twenties he obtained a truck driver's licence and obtained employment as a delivery driver. He later worked as a self-employed sub-contractor. In late 2010 he resigned from his position and took some time off work. He resumed full time work some time around early 2011.

55Mr Howard noted that the offender did not have a history of repeated use of illicit substances. However, he commented upon his excessive alcohol consumption. The psychologist noted that the offender accepted that his ""use of alcohol may contribute to his risk of problem behaviour"". I have already adverted to aspects of the evidence of his alcohol consumption around the time of the offence. 

56Mr Howard administered a number of tests to the offender. They revealed that he was experiencing high levels of depression and a significant degree of stress. He concluded that they were consistent with the offender's presentation and ""reported difficulties adjusting to the outcomes of his offending and isolation from his children"". He indicated that the offender was ""experienc[ing] a moderate level of psychological distress which is consistent with clinically significant features of depression"". I accept this evidence.

57The offender had a relatively minor criminal record. He was convicted of minor driving offences in the late 1990s and 2001. In 1999 he was convicted of common assault and damaging property. For those offences he was fined and placed on a two year recognisance under the former s 558 of the Crimes Act 1900.

58Mr Howard noted that the offender had attempted self harm when he was 18 or 19. He considered that the offender had difficulty ""regulating [his] behavioural responses to stress, within the context of progressive relationship breakdown and acute physical conflict"". This appears to be consistent with the evidence led at the trial. However Mr Howard also stated:

""... it appears that [the offender's] risk of similar maladaptive behaviours was precipitated by increasing acrimony and dispute with [Ms Rathbone] following the cessation of their relationship in February 2011, distress associated with restricted access to his children, and an altercation at the time of the offence in which the victim reportedly enacted physically aggressive behaviours. It is likely that [the offender's] capacity to inhibit problem responses to such stressors at the time of the offence was also aggravated by extensive use of alcohol on the night and morning prior to the offence."" 

59I reject this opinion. There is no evidence that as between the offender and Ms Rathbone there was any attempt by her to impose restrictions on his access to the children. If anything she was seeking help from him in looking after them. It appears from the earlier part of Mr Howard's report that his reference to Ms Rathbone's ""aggressive behaviours"" in this extract is to the version of events the offender gave in his evidence concerning Ms Rathbone which both the jury and I have rejected in large part. I have also addressed the effect of his alcohol consumption.

Aggravating and mitigating factors

60Sub-section 21A(2) of the Sentencing Act lists a series of aggravating factors that the Court is to take into account in determining the appropriate sentence. Sub-section 21A(3) lists a series of mitigating factors. One of the specified aggravating factors is that the offence involved the use of a weapon (s 21A(2)(c)). I have already found that the offender may have used an object to strike Ms Rathbone around the head. A finding expressed in those terms is not sufficient to establish the presence of an aggravating factor as it must be established beyond reasonable doubt.

61In relation to mitigating factors, four are potentially relevant.

62First, the offence was clearly not a planned or organised criminal activity (s 21A(3)(b)). I have described the events surrounding the killing of Ms Rathbone above. It was clearly not premeditated, but was instead the result of an explosion of anger on the part of the offender. 

63Second, ss 21A(3)(e) and (f) refer to the offender not having any significant record of previous convictions and being a person of good character. I have described his criminal antecedents above. I accept that he does not have any significant record of previous convictions. Beyond that I am not prepared to positively find that he was a person of general good character.

64Third, ss 21A(3)(g) and (h) refer to whether the offender is unlikely to offend and whether the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation, whether by reason of his age or otherwise. Leaving aside acts of violence in a domestic or relationship context, I am satisfied that the offender has low prospects of re-offending on his release. Nothing in his background suggests that he has any real propensity to act violently outside of the domestic context. 

65However the circumstances of the offence namely that, following the break-up of his relationship, he cruelly needled Ms Rathbone and then when she responded angrily, killed her in a fit of rage raises obvious concerns about his behaviour in the future in the event that a further relationship sours. However, any prediction of his propensity to commit acts of violence in a domestic context in the future must be undertaken against the background that he will be significantly older before he is placed in any such a situation again. Whether incarceration will assist or hinder him in controlling his emotions in that context is a difficult question to answer. 

66In the end result, while I am satisfied that he has very low prospects of re-offending outside of a domestic context, I assess the likelihood that he may commit some act of violence in a domestic context as moderate.

67Fourth, s 21A(3)(i) of the Sentencing Act provides that it is a mitigating factor in sentencing if there is remorse shown by the offender for the offence:
""... but only if:

(i) the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions, and

(ii) the offender has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions or made reparation for such injury, loss or damage (or both).""

68This is a difficult matter to assess. In a number of the telephone conversations made by the offender to members of his family and friends on the day he killed Ms Rathbone, he expressed distress at his own actions and the fact that she was dead. The circumstances leading up to the offence make it clear that he still had significant feelings towards her although those actions had a strong possessive quality. However, his actions since that time do not suggest that he has truly accepted responsibility for his actions. I was not referred to any evidence that he had acknowledged the suffering that he had caused. I am not satisfied that this mitigating factor is present.

Submissions on behalf of the Crown and the offender

69The Crown Prosecutor submitted that I should find that at the time he inflicted harm upon Ms Rathbone, the offender intended to kill her. To an extent, I have accepted that submission (see [43]). The Crown also submitted that a ""significant period of imprisonment"" was warranted. In order to assist the Court, the Crown referred me to a number of cases the facts of which it was submitted were broadly similar to those of this case. They involved sentences imposed after a trial at which the offender had pleaded not guilty and had attacked or strangled their current or ex-partner. Some involved spontaneous acts and others that were premeditated. One of the cases to which the Court was referred was the decision of Kirby J in R v Christov (No 2) [2006] NSWSC 1179, where a non-parole period of seventeen years was imposed, and R v Chen [2010] NSWSC 64, in which Rothman J imposed a non-parole period of seventeen years and six months. 

70I have considered those two cases and the other cases that I was referred to. It is trite to observe that each case turns on its own facts. Further, Mr Chapple SC noted that all of the decisions that the Crown referred me to were decided prior to the High Court's decision in Muldrock. In particular, the judgment of Kirby J in Christov involved his Honour following the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 and applying a two stage approach to sentencing by starting with a standard non-parole period and determining whether the various factors concerning the offence warranted moderation (at [49] to [57]). This approach was expressly disavowed in Muldrock at [25].

71Otherwise I have already addressed the submissions of Mr Chapple SC including those concerning the presence of various mitigating factors. Mr Chapple SC urged me to ""consider a sentence at the lower end of the range"". 

Conclusion

72It is apparent from the nature of some of the findings that I have made that much is unknown about how and why events on the morning of 8 April 2011 moved from the offender spending time with Ms Rathbone and their young son, to their making love, to his provoking her and then murdering her. What is known from the evidence, the verdict and my findings is that his rage quickly erupted so that he inflicted a level of violence upon her that was out of all proportion to any possible threat that she posed. His conduct was savage but not planned. It has destroyed her life and most of his, deeply wounded the adults around him, inflicted irreparable harm on their two infant children and created a bitter legacy for them to inherit. 

73As a consequence of the decision in Muldrock, there is now some doubt about whether sentencing courts are required or permitted to make an assessment of whether an offence in respect of which there is a standard non-parole period is in the low, middle or high range of objective seriousness (see R v Koloamatangi [2011] NSWCCA 288 at [19] per Basten JA, Adams and Johnson JJ agreeing). If I am required to make that assessment then it suffices to state that the objective features of this offence that I have outlined satisfy me that it falls slightly below the middle of the range of objective seriousness for the offence of murder (cf s 54A(2) of the Sentencing Act). Critical to this conclusion is the spontaneous character of the offence. That said, considerations of general and specific deterrence are especially significant in cases involving extreme levels of domestic violence, even if they are not premeditated.

74It was common ground that any term of imprisonment should commence from 8 April 2011. 

Sentence

75John Michael Meyn, for the murder of Yvette Rathbone you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment.

76Pursuant to s 44(2) of the Sentencing Act, I set a non-parole period of sixteen years and six months imprisonment commencing on 8 April 2011 and ending on 7 October 2027 with an additional term of five years and six months commencing on 8 October 2027 and ending on 7 April 2033.

77The total term of imprisonment is one of twenty-two years. The offender will be eligible for release on parole on 7 October 2027 and the offender's sentence will expire on 7 April 2033.

2706983,R v Karimi; R v Khoury; R v Mir (No. 5) [2013] NSWSC 232,"Judgment (on media application for COPIES OF exhibits l and m to allow them to be broadcast in news reports of the trial - T211)

1JOHNSON J: This is the third day of the jury trial of John Khoury, Mohammed Jawad Karimi and Mahdi Mir on a number of serious charges. 

2Included in the indictment are charges alleged by the Crown to arise out of a home invasion carried out on the premises of the Burgess family at Lurnea on 1 July 2010. In the course of that home invasion, the Crown alleges that Kesley Burgess was murdered by means of multiple wounds inflicted by meat cleavers wielded by the invaders. The Crown alleges, as well, that the property of Tracey Burgess, the mother of Kesley Burgess, was stolen during that alleged offence. 

3As part of the Crown case, the Crown has called to give evidence today, Kristal McLachlan, who was the girlfriend of Kesley Burgess and was in the Burgess house at the time of these events, and Mrs Burgess who likewise was in the house and witnessed the events leading to the death of her son. 

4The Crown has tendered a series of ""000"" calls. The audio recordings of those calls are in evidence. First is a ""000"" call made by Ms McLachlan when in the bedroom occupied by her and Kesley Burgess at the Burgess house, at a time when, on her evidence, one of the invaders commanded that she stop the call and hand over the phone (Exhibit L). 

5In addition, the Crown has tendered three ""000"" calls made later, during which (in at least the first call) may be heard the distressed sounds of the voices of Ms McLachlan and Mrs Burgess calling for urgent assistance, given the tragic events that had occurred. 

6This evidence is graphic in its content. The graphic effect of the evidence is, of course, heightened by the fact that it is, effectively, contemporaneous with the home invasion (Exhibit L) or occurs very soon after the home invasion (Exhibit M).

7During the course of this afternoon, I was informed that three representatives of the television media sought access to the ""000"" calls (Exhibit L and Exhibit M) for the purpose of playing them on tonight's news broadcasts. The applications made by the media representatives were directed promptly to the Public Information Officer of the Court, who has brought them to my attention. 

8The Court has a discretion whether to release exhibits of this sort during the course of a trial: R v Sam (No. 5) [2009] NSWSC 543 at [6]; R v Sam (No. 16) [2009] NSWSC 544; 196 A Crim R 138 at 141 [12]ff. 

9I have called upon counsel to make submissions with respect to the exercise of discretion. 

10The Crown position was that this was essentially a matter for the Court, although it was said that if there was concern in the mind of the Court with respect to the impact upon the jury, then a measure of caution may be appropriate. 

11Counsel for each of the Accused has opposed the application that the disks be made available at this time for broadcasting by the media. 

12I emphasise that no counsel has submitted that there ought be any limitation on the media's ability to make a fair report of what has been said in Court today, including the words and sounds in the ""000"" calls. The opposition is to the release of the electronic exhibits at this time.

13In R v Sam (No. 5), it was necessary to consider an application, in some respects similar to this, during a jury trial. In that judgment, I emphasised (at [14]-[15]) that the Court should have regard to the open justice principle which is a fundamental axiom of the Australian legal system. In addition, I emphasised in that trial, that the subject matter of the trial (and at least this aspect of the present trial) was emotionally challenging for all concerned. 

14I said in that judgment (at [19]) that the principal concern which I had with the media application was the likely tendency of media publicity to distract the jury from their single-minded attention to the evidence adduced in the courtroom. Although I had directed the jury to disregard media coverage and avoid discussion with family and friends (those being orthodox directions in the context of a criminal trial), I observed that there was a risk that a measure of heightened and dramatic publicity may place pressure upon jurors in this respect (at [21]).

15There is a very significant emotional element in this phase of the present trial. So much would be clear to all those who have witnessed the persons who have passed through the witness box today, and in particular Ms McLachlan and Mrs Burgess. 

16Should the media be permitted to broadcast the sounds on the ""000"" calls, there is a real concern, in my view, that the emotional aspects of the trial will dominate the public reporting of the trial, and that this will be heightened substantially (and on an ongoing basis) until the trial is concluded. 

17Of course, the jury have heard the ""000"" calls and they will hear them again. That is not the issue. The concern, in my view, is that the potential distraction of the jury by a heightened emotional level of reporting, accompanied by the sounds contained in the ""000"" calls, will tend to increase the level of inquiry and scrutiny by family and friends to the jurors, which can only operate to distract, or tend to distract the jurors from their duties and obligations as jurors. 

18In R v Sam (No. 5), I made clear that such a position would be a temporary one. When this trial is over, I can see no impediment, subject to any further submission that is put, to the making available of evidence such as this for publication. My concern is the potential negative impact upon this jury, sitting in this trial, if this material is played tonight and (as one might expect) is played thereafter from time to time during the trial, thereby creating constant focal points for discussion with the jurors by friends, family and others.

19The media will in no way be limited in their ability to publish every word spoken in this Court today, in the presence of the jury. In due course, the application for access to these ""000"" calls may be revived. However, for the moment, the application is refused.

2706996,Legg v R [2013] NSWCCA 74,"Judgment

1THE COURT (DELIVERED BY SIMPSON J): The appellant appeals against his conviction on 11 November 2011 in respect of a charge of persistent sexual abuse of a child brought under s 66EA(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. Four grounds of appeal were identified, the most substantial of which (that the verdict was unreasonable) was at the hearing abandoned. 

2The first ground of appeal concerns the procedures undertaken by the trial judge in allowing the complainant to give unsworn evidence. Detailed submissions concerning this ground were placed in writing before the Court and the Crown has conceded that the ground is substantiated and that, as a result, the appeal against conviction should be allowed, the conviction quashed and a new trial ordered. That being the case counsel for the appellant did not seek to press the remaining pleaded grounds.

3All members of the Court have read the written submissions and the concession made by the Crown and are satisfied that the concession is properly made and ought to be accepted by the Court. 

4Accordingly, the orders of the Court are the appeal is allowed, the conviction is quashed and a new trial is ordered.

2706997,R v Abdollahi (No 9) [2013] NSWSC 482,"Judgment
1HIS HONOUR:  At the conclusion of the Crown case, counsel for three of the accused submitted that the prosecution had not established a case to answer. 
2Whilst it is a question of fact for the jury to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the accused, it is a question of law for me to determine whether there is evidence upon which the jury could possibly be so satisfied. 
3It is necessary that I look at the evidence at its highest, which is in a way most favourable to the Crown.  It is not enough for a trial judge to direct a jury to return a verdict of not guilty because it is thought that any verdict of guilty would be unreasonable.  See, generally, R v R (1989) 18 NSWLR 74 and Doney v The Queen (1990) 171 CLR 207.
A case to answer for the accused Kamali?
4Ms Yehia, senior counsel for the accused Kamali, made the first application.  At the commencement of the trial Mr Kamali was arraigned on a single count of riot under s 93B of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  He pleaded not guilty.  
5The prosecution case has involved evidence of various events that are said to have occurred in what might be called a ""disturbance"" in the Fowler Compound at the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre (""VIDC"") on 20 April 2011.  It is alleged that various detainees were responsible for a number of things that occurred, such as throwing tiles from the roof of the Macquarie Building, spraying fire extinguishers and throwing them at staff, taking items on to the soccer field and setting them alight and ultimately setting fire to the staff office.  It is unnecessary to refer to the allegations in any more detail. 
6The Crown alleges that there was a riot because there were 12 or more detainees involved in this activity; that it was carried out for a common purpose; and that the various accused used unlawful violence for that common purpose.  Violence includes violent conduct towards property as well as violent conduct towards persons.  It is not restricted to conduct causing or intended to cause injury or damage but includes any other violent conduct (for example, throwing at or towards a person a missile of a kind capable of causing injury which does not hit or fall short):  s 93A of the Crimes Act. 
7The application by Ms Yehia in respect of her client is not concerned with a question of whether there was a riot but whether there is evidence that he used unlawful violence.  The evidence that may be relevant to this question concerns three prosecution witnesses.
8Mr Simon Atachparian, a Client Services Officer with Serco, the company contracted by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship to run the VIDC, gave evidence that he saw ""clients running through the laundry, trying to pick up some items, bed sheets or pillows or whatever"" (T613).  He claimed that two of them were Medhi Viasi and Manafi.  He said there were others; he thought five or six.  He gave evidence of what he saw Viasi and Manafi doing; in short, taking items to the soccer field where they were set on fire.  He did not see who lit the fire.  When the fire was started he said Viasi and Manafi were close by and the others were ""around them"" (T616). 
9Later in his evidence Mr Atachparian said that one of the others who were with Viasi and Manafi was Kamali Alireza.  He gave a description of him.  But when he was specifically asked to describe what he saw this person do, he said (at T626)): 
""I think he was one of the clients who also was running towards the laundry.""
""I'm pretty sure he was one of the clients running into the laundry.""
[He was not one hundred percent sure whether when he came out of the laundry whether he was carrying anything.]
[He went] ""to the middle of the oval with the other clients"".
""He gathered around with the rest of the clients in the middle of the oval where the rubbish bins were."" 
10Mr Augustus Henry-Peters, who was a Sri Lankan detainee in the Fowler Compound at the time, gave evidence that he was making observations of events concerned with the fire on the soccer field.  He claimed to have seen the ""lighting [of a] fire in the middle of the playground involving [a] mattress"".  He said, ""I was able to see some persons setting fire.""  He said, ""some persons took bed sheets, pillows and mattresses and they were holding lighters and the lighters lit the fire.""  (T1310) 
11Mr Henry-Peters said that he saw ""about six, seven persons"" doing this.  He only knew the name of one of them.  He pronounced the name ""Alireza"", although when asked to spell it he said ""A-L-L-R-S-Z"".  He gave a description of the person that could be regarded as not inconsistent with the accused Kamali. (T1310-1311)  
12When specifically asked what he saw this person do, he said (at T1312):  
""He was present at that time in the place where the fire was set up."" 
""I saw him participating with the others ... in setting the fire.""  
""He was running around."" 
13Whilst he claimed that detainees who were involved in this activity called upon others to come and help, he could not remember or was unable to say, what the person Alireza said. (T1313)  14Later in his evidence (at T1314) he was asked again to specify what it was that he saw Alireza doing.  He said (at T1314): 
""I saw him running around and shouting.  I did not see anything particular that he was doing."" 
""He was going into the building, came out, and then in the ground he was walking fast, he was running.""  
15A little later in his evidence he said, ""He was running around, moving around and we were observing"" (T1320).  He described the areas where he was running including, ""I think he went into the building where he was staying and he also entered the library and there was a kind of noise coming from inside the library"" (T1321) 
16In cross-examination (at T1326), Mr Henry-Peters said that he did not see Alireza with a lighter.  He did not see anything in his hand.  He said:  ""I did not see anything he was holding.""  It was put to him that he did not see Alireza holding any mattress and he replied, ""I did not see him putting.""  It was suggested to him that he did not see this man holding any bed sheet.  He replied, ""He was running around shouting, uttering words, but I did not see any other act he was committing there.""  Finally there was this: 
""Q.  The only thing that you say that you saw the man that you referred to as Alireza doing is running around, shouting out, is that it?  A.  Yes, he was running around and he was in a panic."" 
17In re-examination (at T1328) he was asked whether it was his evidence that the man was holding something but he could not see it, or that he was not holding anything.  He replied, ""To my memory there was nothing in his hand.  That's what I remember."" He reiterated that, ""I was watching him running from one place to another.  He was running from one point to another.""  He was unable to say what the man's intentions were.  18I was taken to the evidence of Ms Susan Bishop, a Client Services Manager.  Her evidence included that there were ""three other clients that also got the garbage bins from near the laundry"" (T903).  She recalled that two of them were ""Manifi"" and Viasi (T906).  She could not provide a name for the third person but provided a description that could possibly be regarded as not being inconsistent with the accused Kamali.  But there was so limited detail in the description that it could be consistent with any other number of detainees: dark hair, taller than ""Manifi"" or Viasi and of thinner build (T906).  
19Ms Bishop said that she saw these three men pulling three bins from the laundry area onto the soccer field where their contents were emptied and then set on fire.  It is to be borne in mind that Mr Henry-Peters spoke of six or seven men.  Which one of the six or seven is the third man Ms Bishop referred to is impossible to determine given the limited, almost generic, nature of her descriptions.
20That is the evidence upon which the Crown relies for the proposition that the accused Kamali used unlawful violence.  In my view, as a matter of law, it is incapable of establishing that he did.  The evidence of Mr Atachparian and Henry-Peters is capable of establishing that Mr Kamali was present when others took items on the soccer field where the items were set on fire.  But it is incapable of establishing more than he was present and ""running around.""  The evidence of Ms Bishop does not add anything.  The third person she described is incapable of being regarded as the accused Kamali, as opposed to some other detainee. 
21There is no case to answer for the accused Kamali and so I will direct the jury to return a verdict of not guilty. 
A case to answer for the accused Mosawi?
22Mr Brasch, counsel for the accused Mosawi, submitted that there was no case to answer in respect of his client on two bases. 
23Mr Mosawi was arraigned on a single count of aiding and abetting riot.  He pleaded not guilty. 
24Mr Brasch's application was that there was no evidence capable of establishing that the acts alleged by the Crown to have been committed by his client were in fact committed by him.  Secondly, he submitted that even if the evidence was capable of establishing that it was Mr Mosawi who did what the Crown alleges, they were not things that were done which would render him liable as an aider and abetter; in short, what it is alleged that he did occurred prior to any riot.  Further, the evidence is incapable of establishing that Mr Mosawi knew that there was a riot and intended to encourage the participation of others in it because of the time the alleged act were carried out. 
25As to the first basis of the application, Mr Brasch pointed to the fact that the only evidence upon which the Crown can rely in relation to his client is that of Ms Susan Bishop.  She said that at one point there was a ""rush"" of clients towards a barrier tape that had been set up in an endeavour to prevent more climbing on to the roof of the Macquarie building (T851).  She said that one of the detainees ""ripped the tape"".  She was asked who that was and she replied:
""That was Mosawi, Mosawi."" (T856)
26She said ""as he ripped the tape he pushed me to the side.""  As she gave that answer she indicated with her left elbow a movement backwards and she reiterated that this occurred ""as he broke the tape"" (T857).
27That was the only observation Ms Bishop made of this man.  No other witness mentioned him at all. 
28The question raised by Mr Brasch is whether Ms Bishop's reference to the detainee who did what she described could possibly be regarded by the jury as a reference to the accused Sayed Ibrahim Mosawi. 
29Mr Brasch referred to the fact that there were two other detainees being held in the Fowler compound with a similar sounding name.  They appear on the twenty-first page of the nominal roll (tab 4 of exhibit A).  There is one man named Sayed Ali Reza Musavi and there is also a man named Sayed Asghar Musawi. 
30Mr Brasch conceded that Ms Bishop was unlikely to be referring to the detainee Musavi, but it was not at all clear whether she was referring to the accused Mosawi or the other detainee, Musawi. 
31Ms Bishop did not provide any description of the man she was referring to.  Her only evidence capable of identifying him was the single name that appears in the transcript as ""Mosawi"". 
32A question was raised as to how Ms Bishop said the name which appears in the transcript with that spelling.  I listened to the audio recording made by the court reporters this morning in order to remind myself.  It is not entirely clear but sufficiently clear to be able to say that the way Ms Bishop pronounced the name was to give more emphasis to the second syllable than the first.  She said the first syllable quite quickly.  She did not sound out the second letter.  The way she said it could be spelt phonetically as M'sawi.  The fact that she said the name twice also indicates some hesitation; perhaps lack of confidence in the correct pronunciation.  33At various stages of her evidence Ms Bishop made it clear that she had difficulty with the pronunciation of the names of detainees.  She did not say this specifically in relation to the accused Mosawi but she said it sufficiently frequently to establish that it is a problem she experienced generally.  See, for example, T 863.9, 900.48, 950.42, 951.17, 959.30, 1000.5 and 1096.15.
34Having regard to these difficulties with the evidence of Ms Bishop, I am satisfied that the evidence is incapable of establishing that the person she claims broke the barrier tape and applied force to her was the accused Sayed Ibrahim Mosawi as opposed to another detainee. 
35I will direct the jury to return a verdict of not guilty in respect of count 8 on the charge of aiding and abetting riot. 
A case to answer for the accused Haidari on the charge of affray?
36The accused Haidari pleaded not guilty to one count of riot and another count of affray.  His counsel, Mr Pontello, submitted that there was no evidence capable of establishing the count of affray.  The Crown Prosecutor conceded this and so I can state the position briefly. 
37According to the Crown's opening address, it was the prosecution case that Mr Haidari was guilty of the offence of affray because he attempted to break the barrier tape, to which I have earlier referred, and pushed Ms Bishop out of the way.  It was also alleged that he pushed another staff member.  He then made his way on to the roof. 
38The only evidence concerning Mr Haidari being in the area of the barrier tape at a time when there was a movement of detainees towards it and, ultimately, further detainees made their way on to the roof, was that of Ms Bishop.  Her evidence was: 
""Q. In any event, Ms Bishop, do you remember giving that evidence yesterday?A.  Yes.
Q.  You mentioned that there had been a rush of clients?  A.  Yes. 
Q.  Do you recall any other clients in that rush?A.  I do recall Haidari Ali. 
Q.  And what do you recall about Haidari Ali?A.  I have, I have an image of him being right up near me when the rush occurred and I can't recall much else."" (T899) 
39This evidence is incapable of establishing the essential element of a charge of affray that Mr Haidari used or threatened unlawful violence.  I will direct the jury to return a verdict of not guilty to count 10 on the charge of affray concerning the accused Ali Haidari.

2707012,R v Naden [2013] NSWSC 435,"Judgment


1HIS HONOUR: I have had the opportunity of reading the psychiatrists' reports as they were emailed to me with the consent of the parties in chambers. 

2Section 8 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 is as follows.

""1. If the question of a person's unfitness to be tried for an offence is raised at any time before the person is arraigned on a charge in respect of the offence, the Court must determine whether an inquiry should be conducted before the hearing of the proceedings in respect of the offence.

2. The Court may, at any time before the inquiry is commenced, determine that there is no longer any need for such an inquiry to be conducted.""

3The question of the accused's unfitness to be tried for the offences of which he has been charged was raised before Latham J on 1 February 2013. Her Honour set the matter down for a fitness hearing on 26 and 27 March 2013. The accused has not been arraigned. 

4The accused's legal representatives raised the question of his unfitness to be tried in the light of Dr Bruce Westmore's report dated 10 October 2012. Dr Westmore, a forensic psychiatrist, had re-examined the accused on 6 October 2012. Dr Westmore concluded that ""based on his current history, [he did] not believe that Mr Naden can at this time be considered fit to be tried"" (ex 1 8/10/12 p 5).

5Professor David Greenberg conducted a psychiatric assessment of the accused on 13 and 19 January 2013 and 2 February 2013 at the request of the Director of Public Prosecutions. In a report dated 4 February 2013, Professor Greenberg expressed the opinion ""that on balance, Mr Naden is currently fit to plea and stand trial"" (ex A p 13). 

6Dr Westmore re-examined the accused on 22 February 2013. In a report dated 25 February 2013, Dr Westmore expressed the following opinion:

""On balance, I think that Mr Naden is now fit to be tried, in that it is not his Depressive Illness which is the primary cause behind his wish to plead guilty to all the allegations against him"" (ex 1 25/02/13 p 6). 

7In his earlier report, Dr Westmore expressed the concern that the accused's ""current plea seems to be greatly affected by his ongoing psychiatric illness"" (ex 1 8/10/12 p 5). 

8Mr Ierace SC told the Court last Friday that there was no longer a question of the accused's unfitness to be tried and the fitness hearing dates were vacated. 

9However, s 8(2) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act obliges the Court to determine that there is no longer any need for an inquiry into the accused's unfitness to be tried. 

10Dr Westmore and Professor Greenberg are of the opinion that the offender is now fit to be tried. Accordingly, I determine that there is no longer any need for such an inquiry to be conducted.

		29 April 2013",2013-03-21 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2707015,Dawson v R [2013] NSWCCA 61,"Judgment

1PRICE J: I agree with Schmidt J. 

2McCALLUM J: I agree with Schmidt J. 

3SCHMIDT J: In November 2011, Neilson J sentenced the applicant to a total of 9 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 6 years and 6 months for five offences involving the sexual assault of his niece. The applicant seeks leave to appeal from that sentence. The Crown has conceded that his Honour erred in one aspect of the sentencing exercise, but the other grounds of appeal were disputed. 

4The charges, maximum penalties and sentences imposed, after a 25% discount for an early plea and finding of special circumstances were:

Count 1 - s 61M(1) Crimes Act 1900 indecent assault on a person aged under 16 years - maximum penalty of 7 years and standard non-parole period of 5 years - non-parole period of 2 years dating from 6 September 2011, expiring 5 September 2013, with a balance of term of 1 year expiring 5 September 2014

Count 2 - s 61I Crimes Act 1900 sexual intercourse without consent - maximum penalty of 14 years and standard non-parole period of 7 years - non-parole period of 3 years dating from 6 March 2012, expiring 5 March 2015, with a balance of term of 2 years expiring 5 March 2017 (pronounced as 2018)

Count 3 - s 61I Crimes Act 1900 sexual intercourse without consent - maximum penalty of 14 years and standard non-parole period of 7 years - non-parole period of 3 years dating from 6 September 2012, expiring 5 September 2015, with a balance of term of 2 years expiring 5 September 2017

Count 4 - s 61I Crimes Act 1900 sexual intercourse without consent - maximum penalty of 14 years and standard non-parole period of 7 years - non-parole period of 5 years dating from 6 March 2013, expiring 5 March 2018, with a balance of term of 2 years, 6 months expiring 5 September 2020

Count 5 - s 61I Crimes Act 1900 sexual intercourse without consent - maximum penalty of 14 years and standard non-parole period of 7 years - non-parole period of 5 years dating from 6 March 2013, expiring 5 March 2018, with a balance of term of 2 years, 6 months expiring 5 September 2020


Grounds of Appeal

5The three grounds of appeal advanced were:

""1. His Honour erred in not giving effect to his finding of special circumstances.

2. His Honour failed to apply the totality principle in relation to the sentences imposed.

3. His Honour gave no weight to the Applicant's significant intellectual disabilities other than on the issue of contrition and remorse.""

The facts

6The applicant was 55 years of age when sentenced. 

7The facts were agreed. The victim was aged 15 years at the time of the indecent assault and 16 at the time of the other four offences. They were reported in November 2009 and the applicant was arrested after investigation in November 2010. 

8In a telephone conversation in August 2010 the applicant admitted that some sexual incidents had taken place. In later text messages he conceded that there had been sexual contact. He admitted the offences charged during interview after arrest. He then said that the victim had not spoken during the incidents and that he had taken her silence for acquiescence. He later asked her, however, if he should leave the family home, so that she could feel 'safe'. He was granted conditional bail, which was revoked during the sentencing hearing. 

9At the time of the offences the applicant had entered a de facto relationship with the victim's mother and was living with them and the victim's brother at their home.

10The aggravated indecent assault (count 1) occurred on a day that the victim was unable to go to school due to a sports injury. The applicant approached her and offered to rub cream onto her injured leg. He then gradually moved his hand higher along her leg towards her genitals, placed his hand inside her shorts, outside her underwear and rubbed her genitals for some minutes, until she said 'it's better' and got up and moved away. She then telephoned her boyfriend and told him what the applicant had done. The applicant entered the room and told her 'don't tell'. The victim did not tell her mother. This incident was followed by uncharged assaults in which the applicant approached the victim while she was lying down in her bedroom and fondled her genitals and buttocks. 

11The first sexual intercourse offence (count 2) occurred in late November or early December 2007, in the victim's bedroom. The applicant rubbed his hands over her body, pulled the rear of her underwear down, moved his hands to her genitals and rubbed her vagina, before digitally penetrating her.

12The second sexual intercourse offence (count 3) occurred on 8 December 2007, in the victim's bedroom, after she came home from a Christmas party. She was in bed when the applicant pulled her underwear down, rubbed her vagina and then digitally penetrated her.

13The third and fourth sexual intercourse offences (counts 4 and 5) occurred on a night in January 2008, in the victim's bedroom, where she was asleep. The applicant entered around midnight and lay down in the bed with the victim. He began touching her body, pulled down her lower clothing and used his fingers to penetrate her vagina for a couple of minutes (count 4). He then climbed on top of her and inserted his penis into her vagina. Intercourse continued for up to 5 minutes, before the victim managed to push him off (count 5). The victim said that he then lay with her for a time, like he was drunk, pretending that he hadn't done anything, before leaving the room.

14Afterwards, the victim got her mother to help her rearrange the furniture in her room in order to barricade one door, which could not be locked. She then locked the other door when in her bedroom at night, in order to prevent further assaults. 

15Also in evidence were the applicant's criminal history; relevant sentencing statistics; a pre-sentence report of 18 July 2011; and a neuropsychological report of 6 November 2011 provided by Dr Susan Pullman, a neuropsychologist and forensic psychologist; and Ms Lisa Zipparo, a psychologist.

16The pre-sentence report noted the applicant's previous contact with the community offender services in 1999 and 2001, when strategies to address alcohol and drug issues had been pursued, with less than satisfactory response from the applicant. At the time of the report the applicant was residing with his mother, as her carer. Prior to being granted bail he had been an involved community member, participating in sports and volunteering with charitable organisations. The report noted that he had been referred to a psychiatrist, to whom he had stated that the victim had initiated the sexual contact. He was unable to explain his failure to set limits, but his risk of re-offending was assessed to be in the low range. 

17This report noted that a worsening abuse of alcohol and cannabis had been admitted. The applicant had been referred to a counsellor, who reported guarded responses and questionable commitment to addressing his drug and alcohol problems, which he suggested had pushed him to this offending, about which he said he had 'lost his commonsense'. He could not explain his offending, for which he attributed significant blame to the victim and which he considered at the time to have been a harmless joke. 

18It was concluded that the applicant had failed to accept personal responsibility for his offending and that he minimised its seriousness. It was considered that longstanding alcohol abuse could have contributed to his memory problems. Assessment for a sex offenders' programme and a neuropsychologist's report were recommended.

19The neuropsychologist's report noted no developmental issues or illnesses in the applicant's childhood. Learning issues at school were noted. He left in year 8 to work on the railways and worked as a labourer for 14 years before running his own milk delivery business for five years and a car detailing business for another five years. He was primary care giver for his children for two years and then did odd jobs, before receiving a disability pension in 2002 as the result of back injuries sustained from labouring.

20The applicant provided a medical history of back surgery 6 years previously, with further back surgery required. He was suffering considerable back pain, which caused him difficulty sitting. He had received treatment for angina in the past and was receiving medication for discomfort after eating.

21The applicant gave a report of being involved in two motor bike accidents while in his 20s, the second causing loss of consciousness and extended hospitalisation for a head injury. He could recall no other details of the accidents and could not reveal details of his recovery. There was no history of mental illness given, but he had experienced feelings of paranoia, which he attributed to his cannabis use. A history of drug and alcohol abuse was given, with cannabis used to self medicate for back pain. The applicant believed this had led to him developing a poor memory, which he described. Momentary lapses of attention were noted, but no comprehension problems were observed, when the applicant was attending to the conversation. His criminal antecedents were noted. 

22The neuropsychological assessment was that based on his educational and vocational background, as well as a formal reading measure, his premorbid intellectual functioning was assessed to be within the borderline range. Various tests were administered, with the result an overall intellectual functioning falling within the 5th percentile. 

23Testing of attention and concentration/information processing, showed that his basic auditory attention span was within the average range; his ability to hold and manipulate information in the low average to average range and mental arithmetic in the below average range. Speed of information processing was within the borderline range. His verbal memory was extremely low and for visual material, below average. His verbal memory was considered to be significantly and unusually below what would be expected given his verbal intellectual abilities. Tests of executive functioning were also well below average, as was verbal fluency. He was assessed as having worked satisfactorily during assessment. He was assessed on the depression scale to be in the mild range, but anxiety was in the extremely severe range.

24It was noted that despite the applicant's history of daily cannabis use for over 18 years, alcohol abuse and a serious traumatic brain injury in his 20s, as well as limited education, he had described a consistent work history at the semi-skilled and labouring levels, until 2002 when he received a disability pension for back injury. 

25It was concluded that on neuropsychological testing there was evidence of significant organic brain impairment which was consistent with 38 years of daily cannabis use, alcohol abuse and a serious head injury. This was considered to have implications for the applicant undertaking the suggested sex offender's treatment programme. It was considered that repetition of information would be crucial to him learning new information, given that his impaired higher level functioning meant that his ability to problem solve, reason, extrapolate and apply new information was limited. 

The sentencing remarks

26His Honour began by noting the Crown's acceptance that there had been a plea entered at the earliest opportunity and that the applicant was accordingly entitled to a discount of 25% for the utilitarian value of his plea. He then turned to the evidence, noting that his victim had known the applicant all her life, referring to him as her favourite uncle, for whom she had a lot of respect. After recounting the agreed facts, his Honour noted that it had been agreed that all the crimes occurred without the victim's consent. The victim never spoke, explaining 'I didn't know what to say, I didn't know what to do, I would just pretend I was sleeping and roll over or move'. 

27His Honour observed that on arrest the applicant candidly conceded that each incident had occurred as described by the victim. He admitted that she never spoke to him and had never encouraged his actions, but said that he had taken her lack of reaction as acquiescence.

28His Honour concluded:
""These offences were committed by the offender in the home of the victim, in the place where she would seek sanctuary: in her bedroom in her own home. I accept that the emotional harm and psychological damage suffered by the victim was substantial and I will shortly refer to the victim impact statement. I have already mentioned the aggravating factor that the offender abused a position of trust in relation to the victim.""


29His Honour considered that other aggravating factors were not established. His Honour noted the remorse evidenced by the admissions and pleas which the applicant had entered, but observed the difficulty presented by the contents of the pre-sentence report, where the author noted that the applicant attributed significant blame to the victim, who he then claimed had initiated the sexual behaviour which he perceived to be a harmless joke at the time. His engagement in the interview was questioned, the author noting that he appeared evasive. His Honour accepted the submission that this may have been because of his psychological makeup.

30His Honour noted the conclusions of Dr Pulman and Ms Zipparo and accepted that the applicant's executive functioning could explain how he showed one attitude on arrest and another during interview for the pre-sentence report. In the result, his Honour accepted that contrition and remorse had been established.

31His Honour then referred to the victim impact statement, observing that the offences had involved substantial emotional harm and damage.

32His Honour then turned to the applicant's criminal history, which commenced when he was aged 13 years, with only one other offence of sexual misconduct when he was aged 20 years, involving assaulting a female and committing an offence of indecency. There was other offending involving traffic offences, break and enter offences and assaults but no offending for some 6 years prior to these offences. 

33His Honour then considered the applicant's personal circumstances, including his school and work record. His Honour also noted his relationship with his former wife between the ages of 16 and 41, which broke down 9 years previously, a break-up he attributed to his excessive use of cannabis. His children were then aged 22, 20 and 19 years. 

34His Honour noted that the applicant had used large amounts of cannabis his entire adult life and now for chronic back pain, as well as his history of alcohol use. His Honour noted that excessive use of cannabis could have an effect on brain functioning and the organic brain damage which Dr Pullman considered could also be attributable to a head injury suffered in a motor cycle accident in his twenties; and that Dr Pulman considered him to be in the bottom 5% of the normal population, so far as his IQ was concerned. His Honour noted that this was consistent with his history of education and occupation, but he also noted that he had been able to provide for his family for the most part. 

35His Honour concluded that:

""Why the offender committed these offences can only be explained by an inability to control his own animal instincts.""


36His Honour noted the applicant's other medical conditions and accepted the submission that his incarceration would be quite onerous for him. He observed that there was no evidence that he would serve his sentence in protective custody, but accepted that imprisonment would be more onerous for him than for younger offenders.

37His Honour referred to other considerations, observing:

""In sentencing for crimes of this nature, there are always a number of important considerations. Of particular importance are general deterrence; that is, trying to prevent others from committing crimes of the same type. Specific deterrence is also important to prevent this offender from committing any such crime again. Denunciation is also very important; the courts are called upon to enforce Parliament's desire that all children should be protected, that young persons should not be abused by older people, who could be seen as predators, and the courts must do their best to ensure that trust given to people is honoured by them. Crimes of this nature must be severely punished.

The Court also is concerned with rehabilitation, because if a person is rehabilitated the likelihood of his or her committing further offences is greatly diminished, and that is one other aspect of sentencing: to ensure that crimes are no longer committed.""



38His Honour then again referred to Dr Pullman's report and the difficulties that the applicant might have in completing the sex offender's programme. He also took account of the assessment that the applicant was unlikely to offend again.

39His Honour rejected the submission that these offences reflected only one episode of criminality and that all sentences should be served concurrently, concluding that there had to be at least partial cumulation, because there were four episodes of criminality. He concluded that the sentences for counts 4 and 5 should be concurrent, because the two acts of sexual intercourse were immediately one after the other, but the other three sentences had to be partially concurrent, given that those three acts of criminality all occurred at different times. 

40After announcing and adjusting the sentences for the first three counts to reflect the need to impose a non-parole period, his Honour indicated that he had departed from the standard non-parole period because of the early plea; because the offences in counts 1, 2, 3 and 4 fell below the mid-range of objective seriousness for such offences, having regard to the acts in question and the age of the victim. He considered that the most serious offence was count 5, when penile/vaginal intercourse occurred without consent over a number of minutes, but took the view that this offence fell just below the mid-range of objective seriousness, because there had been no ejaculation involved, so that the victim had not been exposed to the risk of pregnancy or having some sexually transmitted disease passed on to her and because there was no rough handling involved. 

Ground 1 - special circumstance - error conceded
Ground 2 - totality

41It is convenient to deal with these grounds together. 

42The applicant's case was that the overall sentence imposed upon him was too high, falling at the top of the spectrum of sentencing statistics. This was principally submitted to have been the result of his Honour erring in his approach to deterrence, given the evidence of the applicant's intellectual disability and also because of his failure to properly apply the principal of totality. Further, in order to give true effect to his Honour's finding of special circumstances, there should have been a ratio of 60% and at most 66% of a lower overall sentence fixed as the total non-parole period, rather than the 72% imposed. 

43The applicant's case on totality was that his Honour's error in relation to the overall sentence was demonstrated by his conclusions as to special circumstances; the applicant's intellectual disabilities; and the circumstances of the offending, having in mind the relatively short amount of time involved on each occasion, that three of the counts involved digital, rather than penile penetration, that there was no ejaculation involved in the penile penetration, that the victim did not convey non-consent during the incidents and that the applicant took the victim's approach as indicative of acquiescence. The difference in the criminality involved in counts 4 and 5, even though the same sentence was imposed for each matter, and the common elements involved, namely essentially the same conduct, the same victim and the offences occurring over relatively short period of time of some 4 months together meant that an overall sentence less than 9 years should have been imposed.

44The Crown conceded that ground one had been established, the non-parole period imposed not reflecting the conclusions which His Honour reached as to special circumstances. It did not accept, however, that the total sentence of 9 years was in error, given the overall criminality of the offending for which the applicant was being sentenced. It submitted that the error in sentencing was probably the result of a mathematical error which occurred in his Honour's totality exercise. In the result, while the overall sentence of 9 years would not be disturbed, that representing a lenient sentence in all of the circumstances, a non-parole period of 6 years with a 3 year parole period, would be more than sufficient to reflect the finding of special circumstances.

The Crown's concession was properly made

45His Honour found that special circumstances existed, justifying a variation in the usual ratio of sentence of 75% provided by s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

46On the Crown's case the basis for making that finding was tenuous, but conceded that having reached that conclusion, his Honour had to give proper effect to it in the sentences imposed, or he had to give reasons for not doing so. While his Honour imposed non-parole periods of 60% or 66% for the individual sentences imposed, the overall ratio was 72.2%. That result was not explained and did not reflect his Honour's conclusions as to special circumstances. In view of his sentencing remarks, it was accepted to be apparent that this was not what his Honour intended.

47It does appear, as the Crown observed, that there has been an error, which may have flowed from his Honour's initial mistaken belief that it was unnecessary to impose a non-parole period in relation to any but the last two counts, because the non-parole periods for the other three counts would be overtaken by the non-parole period for the most serious offences. His Honour's attention was then drawn to s 44 and s 45 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, which required that non-parole periods be set for the first three counts. 

48Having had those sections drawn to his attention, his Honour then fixed a non-parole period for each count, specifying commencement and expiration dates, with non-parole periods ranging from 60 to 66% of the head sentence. It was when his Honour dealt with considerations of concurrency and accumulation of sentences, by which the overall sentence was arrived at, applying the principle of totality, that an overall non-parole period of 72.2% of the head sentence was reached. That does not reflect his Honour's findings as to special circumstances and the conclusions which he reached as to the nature and seriousness of the respective sentences.

49In the result, it must be accepted that there has been relevant error. The finding of special circumstances was not given effect and so the applicant must be re-sentenced. In that exercise the question of totality must be revisited.

Ground 3 - insufficient weight given to intellectual disabilities other than on contrition or remorse

50While in written submissions addressed at the sentencing hearing, the applicant's counsel had suggested an overall range of 5 to 7 years for the non-parole period and 8 to 10 years for the overall sentence, that submission was modified during the oral submissions pressed. A sentence at the lower end of the suggested range was urged. 

51His Honour imposed an overall sentence of 9 years and a non-parole period of 6 and a half years, having indicated during oral submissions that he had this figure in mind. It was then that the applicant's counsel urged a sentence closer to the bottom of the submitted range. 

52On appeal it was submitted that this had revealed that his Honour had not approached the sentencing exercise as required by Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 at [45]. His Honour did not rely on s 53A of the Crimes Act 1900, which permits a court sentencing an offender for more than one offence, to impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment with respect to all or any of those offences, instead of imposing a separate sentence of imprisonment for each. In the result, his Honour was obliged to impose a sentence for each matter before considering questions of accumulation and concurrence. His Honour was not entitled to commence the sentencing exercise with the overall term being fixed first.

53In my view that submission may not be accepted. That his Honour raised with counsel during submissions his view as to a matter expressly addressed in the written submission, the overall sentence, does not reveal that he engaged in the erroneous approach suggested on appeal, namely that he did not give the necessary consideration to the individual sentences to be imposed and how they were arrived at. Given the sentences which were imposed, it is apparent that his Honour did give consideration in the required way to the individual sentences.

54In fixing the individual sentences his Honour had regard to both the maximum penalties for each offence and the standard non-parole periods, as well as the other relevant factors, in the way discussed in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [27]. His Honour concluded that count 5, the penile penetration, was the most serious offence. The maximum penalty was 14 years and the standard non-parole period 7. His Honour explained why he departed from the standard non-parole period, amongst other things finding the offence to have fallen just below the mid-range of seriousness. He imposed a sentence of 7 years, 6 months and a non-parole period of 5 years, with 6 months of that sentence made concurrent with that imposed for count 3. 

55The sentence imposed for count 4, the digital penetration committed on the same occasion as count 5, was identical, even though his Honour expressly found that it was a less serious offence, falling below the mid range. That may have been an error, but it has had no practical effect given that sentence was made entirely concurrent with the sentence imposed for count 5.

56His Honour also found that counts 1, 2 and 3 fell below the mid range. The maximum penalty for count 1 was 7 years and the standard non-parole period 5 years. The applicant was sentenced to 3 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years. Counts 2 and 3 also had maximum penalties of 14 years and standard non-parole periods of 7. In each case his Honour imposed a sentence of 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years, each sentence being made concurrent by 6 months. 

57The applicant also complained in written submissions on appeal that no weight was given in the sentences imposed to his 'significant intellectual disabilities', other than on the issue of contrition and remorse. It was submitted that the evidence of his borderline intellectual functioning and well below executive functioning were such that neither general nor specific deterrence should have had a significant impact on the sentences imposed. This should have also been considered in the context of the impact of his time in custody.

58In oral submissions it was argued that while his Honour had referred to the applicant's intellectual disabilities in his sentencing remarks, he had erred in his approach to deterrence, because the evidence required that deterrence be approached in the way discussed in Muldrock:

""[53] Black DCJ's finding, expressed in lay terms, that the appellant's intellectual disability is ""significant"", was apt. It was an error for the Court of Criminal Appeal to reject the finding, if that is what it did. Alternatively, it was an error for the Court to find that Black DCJ's determination, that general deterrence had no place in sentencing the appellant, was not justified by the evidence. One purpose of sentencing is to deter others who might be minded to offend as the offender has done. Young CJ, in a passage that has been frequently cited, said this[66]:

""General deterrence should often be given very little weight in the case of an offender suffering from a mental disorder or abnormality because such an offender is not an appropriate medium for making an example to others.""

In the same case, Lush J explained the reason for the principle in this way [R v Mooney unreported, Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal, 21 June 1978 at 8, cited in R v Anderson [1981] VicRp 17; [1981] VR 155 at 160-161]:

""[The] significance [of general deterrence] in a particular case will, however, at least usually be related to the kindred concept of retribution or punishment in which is involved an element of instinctive appreciation of the appropriateness of the sentence to the case. A sentence imposed with deterrence in view will not be acceptable if its retributive effect on the offender is felt to be inappropriate to his situation and to the needs of the community.""

[54] The principle is well recognised [Veen v The Queen [No 2] [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 476-477. See also R v Anderson [1981] VicRp 17; [1981] VR 155; Scognamiglio (1991) 56 A Crim R 81; R v Letteri unreported, New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, 18 March 1992; Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67; Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48. It applies in sentencing offenders suffering from mental illness, and those with an intellectual handicap. A question will often arise as to the causal relation, if any, between an offender's mental illness and the commission of the offence[See Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 71.]. Such a question is less likely to arise in sentencing a mentally retarded offender because the lack of capacity to reason, as an ordinary person might, as to the wrongfulness of the conduct will, in most cases, substantially lessen the offender's moral culpability for the offence. The retributive effect and denunciatory aspect of a sentence that is appropriate to a person of ordinary capacity will often be inappropriate to the situation of a mentally retarded offender and to the needs of the community.""


59This was not a submission advanced at the sentencing hearing. Nor could it have been. In Muldrock there was unchallenged evidence of the causal relationship between the appellant's retardation and his offending in the reports in evidence. Thus it was concluded at [55] that:

""The fact that the appellant possessed the superficial understanding of a mentally retarded adult that it was wrong to engage in sexual contact with a child and that he told childish lies in the hope of shifting the blame from himself were not reasons to assess his criminality as significant [R v Muldrock [2010] NSWCCA 106 at [34]], much less to use him as a medium by which to deter others from offending.""


60This was quite a different case. Here there was no opinion expressed in the reports as to any causal relationship between the applicant's intellectual functioning and his offending. Nor do the reports reveal that the applicant had 'significant intellectual disabilities'. That no doubt explains how the case was put below. 

61There the parties addressed their written submissions, which for the applicant's part did not develop a case that he had an intellectual disability. For its part, the Crown submitted that both general and specific deterrence had to feature in the sentence imposed. Reference was made to the applicable standard non-parole periods, the objective seriousness of the offences, as well as the requirements of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and considerations of concurrency and accumulation of sentence. Relevant statistics and authorities were addressed.

62For the applicant the matters addressed in written submissions were the early plea and other evidence of contrition and remorse; the applicant's age and other subjective matters. The objective seriousness of the offences was addressed, as was the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation and comparative cases. Reference was made to Muldrock, but not to that aspect of the judgment now relied on. Rather, the role which standard non-parole periods played in sentencing was addressed and the appropriate range specified. 

63In oral submissions a sentence at the bottom of the range proposed in the written submission was urged for the applicant. It was then that it was submitted that he had an impairment of his memory and executive functioning which would be considered in determining the seriousness of the offending, which was submitted to have been reckless, rather than to have been committed in circumstances of true knowledge that the victim was overtly protesting. In the result it was argued that the applicant was in a less culpable position than an offender who had engaged in such conduct with full knowledge that the victim was not consenting. 

64It was also accepted that general deterrence had to play a role in this sentencing exercise, but argued that specific deterrence would be ameliorated somewhat, given the applicant's state of functioning, his inability to comprehend and his ability to engage in and learn from sex offender treatment programmes. This and his age meant that he was unlikely to improve, a matter which would be a question down the track for parole.

65His Honour raised his concern that a non-parole period of 6 and half years would provide the applicant with an opportunity to repeat the sex offender programme to reinforce it, prior to release. His Honour observed that that circumstance could be in his interests, given that the Parole Board might not otherwise approve his parole. It was accepted for the applicant that this could pose a problem. It was submitted that this had to be considered in fixing the appropriate non-parole period, consistently with a finding of special circumstances. In the result, it was submitted that there should be an amelioration of the non-parole period. 

66The Crown's case on appeal was that there was no evidence that the applicant had an intellectual disability, as that phrase is ordinarily understood. On the reports, his long years of abuse of illicit drugs and alcohol, coupled with the residual effects of a head injury sustained while he was in his twenties, had led to some level of brain injury, affecting parts of his cognitive functioning. That was not an intellectual disability of the kind dealt with in Muldrock.

67The Crown also submitted that his Honour's sentencing remarks showed that he had given careful consideration to the evidence, quoting extensively from the reports and accepting that the applicant's apparent lack of remorse may have been attributable at least in part to his cognitive defects, as may have been his evasive conduct with the author of the pre-sentence report. It followed that the favourable consideration which his Honour gave this evidence, was not limited to issues of contrition and remorse, but also to accepting his reduced moral culpability for the offences charged.

68His Honour was obliged to consider all of the evidence, including the applicant's subjective circumstances, which included a positive employment and business history. The evidence did not point to a man incapable of understanding the import of his actions, or their magnitude. Nor was the evidence indicative of an individual with a complete absence of self-control, or overwhelming cognitive limitations. 

69The result of the sentencing exercise had been a favourable one to the applicant, particularly given his Honour's finding of special circumstances and the approach adopted to questions of accumulation and concurrence. To further reduce the sentence would result in a sentence which would not adequately reflect the criminality of his offending.

70I am satisfied that this ground was not made out. 

71At the sentencing hearing it was accepted for the applicant that general deterrence had a role to play in the sentence imposed. On the evidence that concession was properly made. While his Honour did not accept that specific deterrence had no role to play in the sentencing exercise, it is apparent from both the individual sentences which his Honour imposed and the overall sentence of 9 years, that he took quite a generous view of what the reports and the other evidence revealed as to the applicant's mental capacity and functioning, when considering remorse, determining his moral culpability for his objectively serious offences and in reaching the conclusion that special circumstances had been established. 

72His Honour concluded that remorse had been shown, notwithstanding evidence of the applicant's view that the victim's silence had showed acquiescence and that the offences had been a harmless joke. Consent was not an issue on the first count. The agreed facts were that the applicant had not consented; that she had been silent because of fear; and that she had struggled to physically throw the applicant off, during the last offence. His Honour's conclusion that the applicant's views could have been the result of his impaired brain functioning was an extremely favourable one, given what the reports and other evidence revealed as to his level of past functioning.

73That is consistent with affidavit evidence received on appeal, which revealed, as was accepted for the applicant, that apart from his back injury, the applicant is doing very well in prison in terms of his intellectual functioning, successfully completely a number of TAFE programs and assisting other prisoners who have literacy problems. He has not been able as yet to participate in a sex offender's programme, because he is not yet close enough to release on parole to be eligible to participate in the programme. That picture is contrary to the view which his Honour came to, that incarceration might be more difficult for the applicant than for other offenders, but is consistent with the view which his Honour took of the evidence of his level of functioning, which required that specific deterrence play a role in the sentencing exercise. 

74His Honour also took a favourable view of the most serious offence, count 5, because there had been no ejaculation. It is difficult to see how that was a matter which could have been considered to reduce the objective seriousness of this offence in any real way. It was a matter which rested on the victim's belief, not on any evidence given by the applicant. His Honour also considered that the absence of ejaculation had not put the victim at risk of pregnancy or disease. The latter conclusion plainly had no foundation, as was conceded for the applicant, it being contrary to how diseases can be transmitted. The former conclusion is also entirely questionable. It was certainly not the subject of any evidence. 

75His Honour also made the sentence for count 4 entirely concurrent with that imposed for count 5. Notwithstanding the apparent error in the length of that sentence, that, too, was a generous approach, when the agreed facts are considered. While count 4 involved digital, rather than penile penetration, to order no accumulation at all for the sentence imposed for that offence, was quite lenient.

76In the result while I accept that in resentencing, the overall non-parole period should be reduced by 6 months, as the Crown conceded, in my view no error warranting the imposition of a lesser overall sentence has been established. 

77To give effect to that conclusion, the non-parole period for counts 4 and 5 should be decreased from 5 years to 4 years, 6 months, so that the earliest date from which the applicant will be eligible for release will be 5 September 2017, rather than 5 March 2018.

Orders

78I would make the following orders to give effect to the conclusion that the applicant should have been sentenced to an overall sentence of 6 years non-parole period and 9 years total sentence:

1. Leave to appeal is granted.

2. The appeal against sentence is upheld. 

3. The sentence imposed is quashed,

4. In substitution the applicant is sentenced as follows:

		23 April 2013",2013-03-20 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2707032,SD v New South Wales Crime Commission [2013] NSWCA 48,"Judgment

1BASTEN JA: In July 2012 the applicant was required to appear before the New South Wales Crime Commission (""the Commission""). He appeared at a hearing conducted on 3, 6 and 15 August 2012. He was questioned as to his knowledge of two shooting incidents. On 15 August he declined to answer two questions on the ground that in respect of each he had a reasonable excuse. The excuse was, in broad terms, that the Commission declined to make what the applicant considered an adequate non-publication order in respect of any evidence he was to give. The Commission rejected his refusal as unjustified, a decision from which he appealed to the Supreme Court. On 18 October 2012 the primary judge, Adamson J, affirmed the decision of the Commission and dismissed the appeal: SD v NSW Crime Commission [2012] NSWSC 1642. The applicant has sought leave to appeal from that judgment.

2The case at trial proceeded on the basis of a statement of agreed facts which, the parties agreed, did not attract any obligation of confidentiality, other than with respect to the name of the applicant. In accordance with the non-publication order made by the Commission, which was not varied for the purposes of these proceedings, the applicant will not be identified. To regularise this course, the Court should make an order prohibiting publication of the name, and disclosure of other information tending to reveal the identity, of the applicant (who may be referred to by the letters SD). The order is made pursuant to s 7 of the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW), on the ground that it is necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice, which would occur were there to be contravention of the non-publication order made by the Commission, and to avoid destruction of the confidentiality which the proceedings are designed to protect.

3The applicant filed both a summons seeking leave to appeal and a document entitled ""Amended Draft Notice of Appeal"". The applicant required leave to appeal: Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW), s 101(2)(r). Rather than strike out the notice of appeal as incompetent, the preferable course, given the potential importance of the issues sought to be raised, is to grant leave and treat the filed notice of appeal as a document commencing the appeal. Nevertheless, for reasons explained below, on several independent bases the challenge to the decision of the trial judge fails and the appeal must be dismissed.

4It is unnecessary to refer at this stage to the underlying facts other than to note that the inquiry related to two occasions on which shots were fired at a house and a vehicle in a western suburb of Sydney. In respect of the first incident, the applicant was asked where he was on the evening of the incident. In respect of the second incident, the interrogator noted that the Commission had information that he and two other named persons were seen in a vehicle outside the house and that two of the occupants of the vehicle had discharged a number of shots into the house. He was asked, ""What do you say to that?""

Statutory scheme
5The New South Wales Crime Commission Act 1985 (NSW) as in force at the date of the hearing (since repealed and replaced by the Crime Commission Act 2012 (NSW)) (""the 2012 Act"") provided that a witness summoned to appear before the Commission at a hearing was not entitled to refuse to answer a question ""without reasonable excuse"". That appeared from s 18(2), which provided as follows:

""18 Failure of witnesses to attend and answer questions etc

...
(2) A person appearing as a witness at a hearing before the Commission shall not, without reasonable excuse or except as provided by section 18A or 18B:

(a) when required pursuant to section 16 either to take an oath or make an affirmation-refuse or fail to comply with the requirement,
(b) refuse or fail to answer a question that the person is required to answer by the member presiding at the hearing, or
(c) refuse or fail to produce a document or thing that the person was required to produce by a summons under this Act served as prescribed.""

6Section 18A provided an exception for members of the clergy with respect to religious confessions. Section 18B was, so far as presently relevant, in the following terms:

""18B Privilege concerning answers and documents

(1) A witness summoned to attend or appearing before the Commission at a hearing is not (except as provided by section 18A) excused from answering any question or producing any document or thing on the ground that the answer or production may incriminate or tend to incriminate the witness, or on any other ground of privilege, or on the ground of a duty of secrecy or other restriction on disclosure, or on any other ground.

(2) An answer made, or document or thing produced, by a witness at a hearing before the Commission is not (except as otherwise provided in this section) admissible in evidence against the person in any civil or criminal proceedings or in any disciplinary proceedings.

(3) Nothing in this section makes inadmissible:
...

(b) any answer... in any civil or criminal proceedings or in any disciplinary proceedings if the witness does not object to giving the answer... irrespective of the provisions of subsection (1)..."" .

7To attract the immunity from use of any answer given, the witness must object: s 18B(3)(b). Although s 18B(1) appears to be comprehensive in its exclusion of grounds of privilege, there is separate provision in respect of client legal privilege in s 18B(4). Such privilege is protected, absent waiver by the person enjoying the privilege.

8The ""use immunity"" identified in s 18B(2) is restricted to inadmissibility in evidence. It does not prevent the answers being used as a basis for further investigation, either by the Commission or by police who are provided with the evidence. The protection given does not extend to what has been described as ""derivative use immunity"". Nevertheless, there are other constraints on the use that can be made of information supplied at a hearing before the Commission. Thus, a hearing is to be held in private and the Commission has control over the persons who may be present during the hearing: s 13(5)-(7). It is an offence for any member of the staff of the Commission to divulge or communicate any information acquired in the course of exercising functions under the Act, ""except for the purposes of this Act or otherwise in connection with the exercise of the person's functions under this Act"": s 29(2). Of central importance to the applicant's submissions were the terms of s 13(9):

""13 Hearings
...

(9) The Commission may direct that:

(a) any evidence given before it,
...
(c) any information that might enable a person who has given or may be about to give evidence before the Commission to be identified or located, or
(d) the fact that any person has given or may be about to give evidence at a hearing,

shall not be published, or shall not be published except in such manner, and to such persons, as the Commission specifies, and the Commission shall give such a direction if the failure to do so might prejudice the safety or reputation of a person or prejudice the fair trial of a person who has been or may be charged with an offence.""

9This last provision (now s 45 of the 2012 Act) was the basis for a direction given in the present case. It is an offence to publish protected information in contravention of a direction under sub-s (9): s 13(12). 

Applicant's contentions
10At the heart of the applicant's case lay two directions under s 13(9), given by the Commissioner. On 6 August 2012, a direction was made in the following terms:

""The Commission directs that any evidence given by this witness or tendered or produced in the presence of this witness or any information that might enable this witness to be identified as a person who has given evidence before the Commission shall not be published except in a manner and to such persons as the Commission may specify.""

11On 15 August the Commissioner gave a further direction, in two parts. The first part was to the same effect as the direction given on 6 August: it concluded with the words ""shall not be published except in such manner and to such persons as the Commission specifies"". The second part was in the following terms:

""I, ancillary to the ... direction just given, I [sic] further direct that the following classes of persons are specified as persons to whom the contents of this hearing and the identity of the witness may be published:

(a) [the applicant's solicitor];
(b) [the applicant] himself;
(c) the persons appointed to assist the Commission in this hearing and who are present in the hearing room, of whom there are three;
(d) myself;
(e) such lawyers of the Commission employed by the Commission who have carriage of matters relating to this hearing;
(f) those persons who are monitoring the audio/visual recording of the Commission and are charged with the responsibility of typing any transcript that is required of it.""

12Perhaps from an abundance of caution, the Commissioner appeared to combine a direction under s 13(5) as to the persons who might be present during the hearing, and a direction under s 13(9) as to publication of evidence given during a hearing.

13By bringing proceedings in the Supreme Court, the applicant and his solicitor might be thought to have contravened the direction by identifying the applicant as a person who had given evidence before the Commission. However, the proper construction, accepted by the parties, was that, to the extent necessary for a person to exercise his or her right of appeal to the Supreme Court under s 19 of the Crime Commission Act, there was an implied statutory exemption to the direction. In other words, the direction could not prevent, or impair or detract from the exercise of the statutory right of appeal.

14The applicant's submission to the Commission was that the direction did not, but should, expressly state that his evidence would not be published to the New South Wales Police or the Director of Public Prosecutions (""the DPP""). In the course of a discussion, recorded in the agreed facts, between the Commissioner and the applicant's solicitor, the Commissioner noted that the information could not be published to the DPP, or to police or other investigating officers who were not members of staff of the Commission, absent a further direction. It was unclear why the applicant's solicitor sought an additional direction and why the Commissioner was unwilling to give it. The absence of such a statement, however, formed the basis of the applicant's refusal to answer the questions, which precipitated these proceedings.

15According to the primary judge, the applicant submitted before her ""that unless an irrevocable non-publication order was made preventing the Commission from disclosing his answers to the NSW Police and the DPP, his right to a fair trial would be irremediably prejudiced"": at [32]. In the course of argument on appeal, the Court raised the possibility that there might be no power to vary a direction in circumstances where the direction was given prior to the evidence being given, so that any evidence would be given in reliance on the scope of the direction. Whether counsel for the applicant adopted that approach was not entirely clear. However, it is as well to deal with it as a form of irrevocability.

Applicant's case on appeal
(a) reasonable excuse
16In order to avoid the obligation to answer in s 18(2), the applicant sought to establish a ""reasonable excuse"" for refusing to answer, being the absence of an order of the Commission expressly preventing the answers being provided either to police officers investigating criminal offences for which he might be charged, or to the DPP if charges were to be laid. He needed to establish that any future disclosure to those bodies might prejudice a fair trial. Those propositions require an understanding of the scope of ""reasonable excuse"" in the context of the Crime Commission Act and of the steps which might prejudice the fair trial of a person charged with an offence. 

17It is convenient to start with the concept of ""reasonable excuse"". The applicant submitted that the concept was broad enough to cover ""no more or less than an excuse which would be accepted by a reasonable person"": Taikato v The Queen [1996] HCA 28; 186 CLR 454 at 470 (Dawson J). However, it is also important to recognise that the term appears in many statutes and reported decisions but ""decisions on other statutes provide no guidance because what is a reasonable excuse depends not only on the circumstances of the individual case but also on the purpose of the provision to which the defence of 'reasonable excuse' is an exception"": Taikato at 464 (Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ); Attorney-General (Cth) v Breckler [1999] HCA 28; 197 CLR 83 at [17]. The applicant's submissions appeared to be on stronger ground in relying on the reasoning of this Court in Ganin v New South Wales Crime Commission (1993) 32 NSWLR 423, particularly at 435 in the judgment of Kirby P (with whom Meagher JA and O'Keefe AJA agreed). However, the analysis in Ganin is of limited assistance because the scheme of the legislation was quite different prior to the New South Wales Crime Commission Amendment Act 1996 (NSW), which removed the critical provisions in s 18 upon which Ganin relied and introduced a new s 18B, to which attention must be now directed. 

18The introduction of s 18B(1) drastically circumscribed the circumstances in which a witness is excused from answering questions. A witness cannot invoke any ground of ""privilege"", ""duty of secrecy"" or ""other restriction on disclosure"": if that were not sufficiently comprehensive, it extends further to ""any other ground"". It must be the breadth of the last phrase which was relied upon by the applicant, as he did not (and could not) assert any privilege or other legal entitlement to refuse to answer questions. Rather, the basis of his refusal was an asserted concern to obtain a fair trial, were he to be charged with an offence. Although the argument was not clearly developed, it may have implied that the removal of ""any other ground"" for refusing to answer a question was directed to the nature of the question and the answer to be given, rather than the use which might be made of the evidence subsequently. Were it otherwise, s 18B(1) would effectively remove any scope for the existence of a ""reasonable excuse"" under s 18(2) for not answering a question. Both sections must be given work and read harmoniously, if possible.

19Given the scope of the submissions before this Court, it is inappropriate to elaborate further on the meaning of the phrase ""reasonable excuse"" in the present statutory context. It is sufficient to deal with the justification proffered by the applicant for refusing to answer the questions. That justification was inadequate, and thus did not constitute a ""reasonable excuse"" for the following reasons.

(b) pre-evidence protection
20It is logical to address first the concept of an ""irrevocable"" direction, to be given before answering questions. The applicant's primary submission was that, although the Commissioner might have power to vary the direction given, he could not do so without notice to the applicant: Tcpt, 07/02/13, p 3(30)-(35). Authority for that proposition was said to be found in Johns v Australian Securities Commission [1993] HCA 56; 178 CLR 408. That approach appeared to assume that the precise terms of the original direction were critical. Thus, if they incorporated, as they appeared to do, a power to make further exceptions in the future, the applicant may have feared he would lose the opportunity to oppose any further exceptions. In less absolute terms, he may have thought that to give evidence in the knowledge that there might be further exceptions could diminish the weight of any subsequent objection to a further exception. The precise concern was not clearly articulated.

21Any suggestion that the Commission was obliged to make a non-publication order before the evidence was given should be rejected. No doubt it was open to the Commission to give such a direction (as it did), but the existence and terms of the direction depended on the Commission's assessment, relevantly for present purposes, of whether publication in a particular manner of particular evidence might prejudice the fair trial of a person. Usually it will not be possible to make such an assessment without knowing the content of the evidence. Although the applicant may have known the answers to the questions he was asked, the Commission is not obliged to give a direction by speculating as to what those answers may be. If a direction were given in advance of the evidence, putting to one side the question of notice to the applicant, it must be capable of variation to permit the Commission to fulfil its statutory functions: as a general rule, the Commission cannot by conduct fetter its powers and obligations to investigate matters referred by the Management Committee. 

22Nevertheless, the applicant's position with respect to s 13(9) is contradictory. He relies upon the obligation cast on the Commission by s 13(9) to give a direction if the failure to do so might prejudice the fair trial of a person. He then expresses a concern that the Commission may have a power to vary or revoke any such direction. Assuming such a power to exist (as I think it must) it would be inconsistent with the legislative scheme to uphold a power which permitted variation or revocation with the consequence that there might be prejudice to a fair trial. The implied power to vary or revoke must be subject to the same constraints as the original power. In other words, the direction is in a sense ""irrevocable"" for so long as the Commission is satisfied that the direction is necessary, because its absence might prejudice a fair trial.

23Absent any obligation to give a non-publication direction in relation to evidence not yet given, the failure to give a direction cannot, in the context of this legislation, constitute a reasonable excuse for not answering questions. For that reason alone the appeal must be dismissed.

24In any event, the applicant presently enjoys the protection he seeks. No question of varying the direction, for example by expanding the persons or bodies to whom evidence may be released, has yet arisen. That provides a further reason for rejecting the appeal. It also renders moot the applicant's submission that Johns v Australian Securities Commission entitles him to notice and an opportunity to be heard in opposition to any variation. However, the correctness of the applicant's invocation of that authority should not be assumed. Johns held that where the Australian Securities Commission (""the ASC"") had examined a director of a company (Mr Johns), the activities of which were the subject of a Royal Commission, transcripts of the examination should not have been released to the Royal Commission in a public hearing, without Mr Johns having an opportunity to oppose that course. There were, potentially, two issues to be resolved with respect to disclosure. The first was whether Mr Johns was entitled to be heard before the ASC disclosed the material to the Royal Commission; the second was whether he was entitled to be heard only with respect to a disclosure which permitted the Royal Commission to use the documents in a public hearing. It appears that the Court was concerned with a decision to release the documents in public hearing, as to which Mr Johns was entitled to be heard. There is no clear finding that he would have had a similar entitlement if the documents had been released only to the Commissioners and subject to a condition otherwise maintaining confidentiality in their contents. Further, the application of the requirements of procedural fairness in respect of an investigation of suspected criminal activity by a body established for that purpose may be sparse: National Companies and Securities Commission v The News Corporation Ltd [1984] HCA 29; 156 CLR 296. In short, it is doubtful whether Johns would support a right to be heard in the event that the Commission thought it appropriate, in the exercise of its statutory powers, to release the material to the police or the DPP, at least if a condition of release was that the material not be published beyond the proper requirements of an investigation or a prosecution.

(c) whether disclosure to police might prejudice a fair trial
25In these circumstances it is unnecessary to address other elements in the applicant's case, namely whether the purpose of s 13(9) relied upon in the present case, to avoid disclosure of material which might prejudice a fair trial, was satisfied. However, against the possibility that the foregoing analysis is erroneous, the elements may be briefly considered. Disclosure to the police will be addressed first.

26The Crime Commission Act gives no protection against an answer being used for the purposes of an on-going criminal investigation. Indeed, to impose such a constraint would be to limit the functions of the Commission in a manner which finds no source in ss 6, 7 or 8 of the Crime Commission Act. True it is that an important function of the Commission is to assemble evidence ""that would be admissible in the prosecution of a person for a relevant offence"" - s 6(1)(b) and (2) - which, given the use immunity for answers to questions, can never include admissions made by a person who is charged with a relevant offence. But that is by no means the sole function of the Commission: rather, the primary function of the Commission is to ""investigate matters relating to a relevant criminal activity"" referred to it by its Management Committee for investigation - s 6(1)(a) - and to ""disseminate intelligence and information to such persons or bodies as the Commission thinks appropriate"": s 7(a).

27The principal object of the Act is ""to reduce the incidence of illegal drug trafficking""; the secondary object is ""to reduce the incidence of organised and other crime"": s 3A. The phrase ""relevant criminal activity"" (referred to in s 6(1)(a)) means ""any circumstances implying ... that a relevant offence may have been ... committed"", where ""relevant offence"" includes a serious drug offence and any other offence as to which the Management Committee is satisfied that its investigation is in the public interest and that ""the use of the Commission's functions may be necessary to fully investigate the offence"": s 3(1).

28The investigation of criminal activity, if publicly revealed, may have the capacity to prejudice a person's safety or reputation, or to prejudice the fairness of a trial consequent upon charges being laid. The Commission is given powers and, in circumstances identified in s 13(9) a duty, to take steps to avoid publication of information where that might prejudice a person's safety or reputation or fair trial.

29The reference to prejudice to a fair trial is of some importance. In relation to known criminal activity, the successful end to a criminal investigation is likely to be the laying of charges with at least a possibility of a trial. A primary purpose of the Crime Commission Act is to enhance the likelihood of the laying of charges and the prosecution of such charges at trial. The primary purpose of the Commission is thus furthered by an appropriate non-publication order, but impaired by a restraint on disclosure to the police or prosecuting authorities. Thus, read in its statutory context, the purpose of s 13(9) is not to limit or prevent disclosure or dissemination of material for the purposes of investigation or prosecution, but to prevent any wider publication which would jeopardise those functions.

30That conclusion is consistent with the statutory language which refers to furnishing evidence (s 6(1)(b) and (2)), furnishing information or a report on that information (s 6(3)(a) and (3A)(a)) and disseminating intelligence and information (s 6(1)(d) and (7)(a)). In relation to unauthorised disclosure, the Act refers to divulging or communicating information: ss 28(5)(a) and 29(2)(b) and disclosure (in s 29A). By contrast, ""publish"" and ""publication"" are only used (except in relation to bulletins in s 28 and the Gazette in Schedule 4) in s 13(9) and (12). The concept of publication in relation to the safety or reputation of an individual or the fairness of a trial would ordinarily connote making information available to the world at large or to a section of the public. That is a concept distinct from release, dissemination or furnishing to a governmental authority for statutory purposes. On that basis, the terms of s 13(9) have nothing to say about the exercise of the Commission's own functions in providing information or evidence to the police or the DPP.

31There are other indicators which support that view. Because s 18B(2) does not preclude use of answers given under compulsion for the purposes of further investigation, it is implausible to read s 13(9) as conferring on the Commission a power to direct itself as to the use it can make of answers in the further investigation of criminal activity. There are two ways in which further investigation can happen. First, the Commission may arrange for police officers to serve as staff of the Commission: s 32(5). Alternatively, the Management Committee may arrange with the Commissioner of Police for a ""police task force to assist the Commission"": s 27A(1). The secrecy provisions in s 29 apply both to police officers who are members of the staff of the Commission and to members of a police task force. If the Commission is entitled to use information gained in the course of a hearing to carry out further investigations through police engaged to provide services either under s 27A or s 32, there is no basis in the statute to suggest that the information cannot, in circumstances deemed appropriate by the Commission, be supplied to police investigating the relevant criminal activity as members of the NSW Police Force.

32There was no authority relied upon for the proposition that the Commission could not supply information to members of the Police Force: such a proposition is inconsistent with the functions and purposes of the Commission and must, accordingly, be rejected. There was, therefore, no obligation for the Commission to make an order precluding publication of any evidence to the police.

33This analysis does not mean that the Commission is free to conduct its activities in a manner which could constitute a contempt of court in relation to criminal proceedings (or indeed civil proceedings, although that is far less likely to occur). The conclusion is, rather, that such constraints as exist do not arise from the operation of a direction by the Commission to itself under s 13(9). The proper basis for that conclusion is that there is nothing in the Crime Commission Act which purports to relieve the Commission from the general law obligation not to conduct itself in a manner which might constitute a contempt of court. That such an obligation is founded in the general law may be supported by the limited operation of s 13(9). That provision is only concerned with publication of evidence (and other material). In Hammond v The Commonwealth [1982] HCA 42; 152 CLR 188 a threatened contempt was identified in circumstances where a Royal Commission proposed to continue to examine a person who had been charged with a criminal offence while the criminal proceedings were still outstanding. It was accepted by the Court that the examination would take place in private, the evidence would not be publicly released and could not be used at the criminal trial. Nevertheless, the examination itself was held to constitute a contempt. Section 13(9) would have nothing to say about conduct other than publication of evidence; the fact that the Crime Commission might be restrained for a contempt of court not involving the publication of evidence must depend upon the general law and its ability to resist such restraint would depend upon a proper construction of the Crime Commission Act as a whole. A similar approach should be adopted in respect of a public release of evidence, regardless of s 13(9).

(d) whether disclosure to the DPP might prejudice a fair trial
34The next question is whether any duty imposed by s 13(9) to prevent publication which might prejudice a fair trial encompassed an obligation to ensure that the transcript of evidence given before the Commission is not supplied to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The formulation of the question in these terms renders an affirmative answer difficult. First, nothing in the Crime Commission Act would support an affirmative answer. Only with some awkwardness could the release of information to the Director of Public Prosecutions be seen to constitute ""publication"" for the purposes of s 13(9). Secondly, no case was identified in which disclosure of material, even if inadmissible or illegally obtained, to a prosecutor has been held to give rise to an unfair trial. While misuse of such material could lead to a trial being aborted or a conviction set aside, there is no reason why the Commission should expect, or has an obligation, to protect against misuse.

35Leaving all that aside, the artificiality and prematurity of the applicant's case remains a problem. The likelihood of different considerations arising at different times may be illustrated by reference to the second question which the applicant refused to answer. The question itself indicated that three people were believed to have been in the car when shots were fired. Each of those three might be the subject of compelled testimony before the Commission. Each might tell a different story as to where he or she was in the car and who fired a gun. Independent evidence may indicate that one or more of the statements was not to be believed. If charges were to be laid in such circumstances, it would be the responsibility of the Director to formulate appropriate charges for the purposes of an indictment: Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986 (NSW), s 7. The Director must, of course, present a charge supported by admissible material. However, inadmissible material may demonstrate that it is inappropriate to formulate a charge in a particular way or against a particular individual. It would not obviously be in the public interest to foreclose access to that material. 

36No reference was made in this context to the recent amendments to the Director of Public Prosecutions Act which impose on ""law enforcement officers investigating alleged indictable offences"" the duty to disclose to the Director ""all relevant information ... obtained during the investigation that might reasonably be expected to assist the case for the prosecution or the case for the accused person"": s 15A(1). The term ""law enforcement officer"" includes an officer of the Crime Commission: s 15A(9). While that duty did not arise in those terms at the time of the hearing before the Crime Commission or before the primary judge, s 15A, as in force in August 2012 did impose an obligation in similar terms on ""police officers"" subject to a bona fide claim of ""statutory immunity"", which may have included a duty not to disclose pursuant to a direction of the Commission: s 15A(6), which remains in similar form.

37As with disclosure to the police, there can be no carte blanche obligation not to provide a transcript of evidence taken before the person was charged with any offence to the prosecuting authorities, in the event that charges are laid. Again, the present direction precludes both forms of disclosure in any event.

Consistency with authorities
38The remaining question is whether the preceding analysis is consistent with existing authorities in respect of the Crime Commission Act and its Commonwealth equivalent, the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth) (""the ACC Act""). The applicant sought to gain support for his contentions from the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in Australian Crime Commission v OK [2010] FCAFC 61; 185 FCR 258 (""ACC v OK"") and a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal, following that judgment, namely R v CB; MP v R [2011] NSWCCA 264 (McClellan CJ at CL, Buddin and Johnson JJ agreeing). Reference should also be made to the recent decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal, R v Seller; R v McCarthy [2013] NSWCCA 42 (Bathurst CJ, McClellan CJ at CL and Rothman J). Each of those decisions concerned the operation of the ACC Act and not the State legislation. While they serve common purposes, there are significant differences in their structures and language.

39In order to assess the relevance of the authorities relied upon, it is helpful to distinguish a number of procedural variables. The first set of variables involves the time of the questioning. Thus, the questioning may be:

(a) before the laying of any criminal charge, or
(b) after a charge has been laid, in relation to -
(i) the subject matter of the charge, or
(ii) other matters.

40The second set of variables concerns dissemination or publication of evidence obtained under compulsory powers, which may be:

(a) to police for investigation;
(b) to the prosecution in respect of a charge, or
(c) to the public at large.

Dissemination or publication of evidence could also occur before or after charges are laid. Even in relation to a prosecution, as it is the Director of Public Prosecutions who is responsible for formulating charges on an indictment, dissemination to the DPP may be either before or after filing an indictment.

41The third set of variables concerns the relief sought and the stage at which relief is claimed. In broad terms, the relief may involve:

(a) prohibition against questioning;
(b) prohibition against dissemination of evidence obtained under compulsion;
(c) a stay of criminal proceedings, or
(d) an appeal against a verdict at trial.

42Of the cases noted above, only ACC v OK involved a challenge to the obligation of a witness to answer questions. In this sense, ACC v OK, like the present case, involved a pre-questioning prohibition. However, it differed from the present case in that it was only concerned with the power of the ACC to continue to question a person after charges had been laid and in relation to the subject matter of the charges: 185 FCR 258 at [86]. Each of the other cases (CB and Seller) concerned applications for a stay of criminal proceedings, based on the fact of compulsory questioning by the ACC. CB and Seller differed in other respects. In Seller, both Mr Seller and Mr McCarthy were questioned before charges were laid, the evidence being provided to the Commonwealth DPP in order to determine whether, and if so what, charges should be laid: Seller at [19], [23], [28] and [30].

43While the procedural stage in ACC v OK was similar to the present case, the witness having refused to answer questions, the equivalent of s 18(2) in the State law, namely s 30(2) of the ACC Act, did not provide for a defence of ""reasonable excuse"" for refusing or failing to answer a question, nor was there a statutory right of appeal against a direction to answer.

44There was a further factual distinction of some importance. The argument put forward by the witness in ACC v OK relied upon the fact that before the examination at which he took objection, he had already been arrested and charged with the offence in respect of which he was being questioned. In Hammond the High Court held that it would be a contempt for a Royal Commission to compel an accused person to answer questions in relation to an offence with which he stood charged in pending criminal proceedings. In Hammond, Gibbs CJ stated at 198:

""Once it is accepted that the plaintiff will be bound, on pain of punishment, to answer questions designed to establish that he is guilty of the offence with which he is charged, it seems to me inescapably to follow, in the circumstances of this case, that there is a real risk that the administration of justice will be interfered with. It is clear that the questions will be put and pressed. It is true that the examination will take place in private, and that the answers may not be used at the criminal trial. Nevertheless, the fact that the plaintiff has been examined, in detail, as to the circumstances of the alleged offence, is very likely to prejudice him in his defence.""

45The critical feature of Hammond, as discussed in the later case of Sorby v The Commonwealth [1983] HCA 10; 152 CLR 281, was that the plaintiff in Hammond ""was awaiting trial for a criminal offence, and there was a real possibility that if he was required to answer incriminating questions the administration of justice would be interfered with"": at 299 (Gibbs CJ). The fact that Mr Sorby had not been charged, although a decision had been made to charge him, was sufficient to distinguish the case from Hammond: at 307-308. The High Court in Sorby accepted that the Parliament could validly override the privilege against self-incrimination although it accepted that, in particular circumstances, an examination might amount to a contempt, which could be restrained. 

46In ACC v OK, the Full Court of the Federal Court considered that the powers of the Commission to direct that material not be released, or not be released at a particular time, under s 25A(9) of the ACC Act, provided sufficient protection against a contempt of court in relation to the criminal proceedings and allowed for the Commission's investigation to proceed, in accordance with the objects of the Act which the majority noted ""could be seriously impaired if its investigations had to stop for an indeterminate period because charges had been laid"": at [109] (Emmett and Jacobson JJ). The joint reasons continued at [110]:

""The coercive powers conferred on examiners do not come to an end on the laying of criminal charges. The provisions of s 25A [which include provisions equivalent to those in s 13 of the Crime Commission Act] clearly contemplate examinations continuing in the face of pending charges. The provisions confer on an examiner, and on the CEO, powers to ensure that there is no real risk to a fair trial. That is to say, the terms of the provisions expressly contemplate that the examiner must give a direction if the failure to do so might prejudice the fair trial of a person who has been charged with an offence. Further, the CEO must not vary or revoke a direction once made, if the CEO forms the view that the revocation or variation might prejudice the fair trial of a person who has or may be charged with an offence.""

47Section 25A(9) of the ACC Act differed from s 13(9) of the State Crime Commission Act in that it conferred the power (and obligation) to give a non-publication direction on the examiner, whilst separate power to vary or revoke a direction made by an examiner was conferred on the Chief Executive Officer (""CEO"") of the ACC. However, the CEO was under an obligation not to vary or revoke a direction ""if to do so might prejudice the safety or reputation of a person or prejudice the fair trial of a person who has been or may be charged with an offence"": s 25A(11).

48At the time of the events in ACC v OK, where the ACC had obtained evidence that would be admissible in prosecution of an offence, the CEO was required to give the evidence to a relevant law enforcement authority: s 12(1). The CEO was also empowered to give other information relevant to the activities of a law enforcement agency, if to do so would not be contrary to a law of the Commonwealth, a state or territory: s 59(7). (These provisions have since been amended.) The joint reasons concluded that ""[a] direction given under s 25A(9) is effective, and overrides the statutory obligation imposed by s 12 or s 59 on the Commission, the CEO or the Board to assemble and give evidence or disseminate and furnish information or reports"": at [111]. 

49The differences in the statutory schemes and the fact that, unlike the present case, the Full Court was dealing with an examination of a person who had already been charged with an offence, prevent the reasoning applying in the present case. Nevertheless, it must be acknowledged that the Full Court's construction of the ACC Act differs from that adopted above in relation to the Crime Commission Act. The obligation under the general law to avoid conduct which might constitute a contempt of court forms a limitation on any obligation to provide information or furnish admissible evidence. At least within the scheme of the Crime Commission Act, the idea that such protection depends on the Commission giving itself a direction is unattractive. In any event, the construction of the legislation set out at [33] above achieves the same effect in the present circumstances. 

50The second case relied upon by the applicant was the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in CB. That case also concerned the ACC Act and not the State legislation. The facts in CB resembled those in ACC v OK in that at least one of the applicants (CB) was examined before the ACC in respect of matters the subject of extant criminal charges: [57], [90] and [131]. The procedural stage reached, however, differed from that in ACC v OK. In CB the ACC stopped its examination after the first day and did not provide a copy of the transcript to the DPP: at [2]. CB and MP, however, sought a permanent stay of the charges brought against them; the trial judge in the District Court granted a stay in respect of CB but not in respect of MP. The facts thus differed from those in the present case because CB was examined after the charges were laid. The possible disclosure of his evidence before the ACC was only indirectly relevant to the decision that the conduct of the examination did not warrant a permanent stay of the criminal proceedings.

51The Court of Criminal Appeal held that the mere fact that an examination had been conducted after the charges were laid, in regard to the subject matter of the charges did not constitute a contempt of the criminal court nor provide a basis for the permanent stay: at [103] and [128]. The reasoning of McClellan CJ at CL accorded with, and adopted that of Emmett and Jacobson JJ in ACC v OK: at [108]-[111]. The final conclusion in CB was in the following terms, at [111]:

""Provided the knowledge of the proceedings in the Commission are adequately protected an accused person's entitlement to a fair trial in accordance with the adversarial process will be ensured. The situation is no different whether at the time of the Commission hearing a charge has not been laid or the criminal process has commenced. The right to a fair trial will only be compromised if information relevant to a person's defence in any form, including any derivative information, is available to the prosecution.""

52The last sentence has been qualified in the recent decision of Court of Criminal Appeal in Seller, where Bathurst CJ stated (with the agreement of McClellan CJ at CL and Rothman J) at [106]:

""Any relief given as a result of dissemination contrary to a direction or in circumstances where a direction should have been given, would depend upon whether in fact the dissemination has compromised the accused's rights to a fair trial and what steps are necessary to alleviate the position.""

53McClellan CJ at CL clarified the last sentence in the passage from his judgment in CB set out above, noting that while the right to a fair trial ""could"" be compromised by release of information to the prosecution, this would not necessarily be the case: at [120].

54There is a further respect in which Seller may qualify the reasoning in CB. Thus, in CB it was said that the protection available under the ACC Act would be sufficient to ensure a fair trial whether or not a charge had been laid ""at the time of the Commission hearing"". In Seller, the principles were said to be the same whether the dissemination occurred ""before or after charge"": at [105].

55These matters need not be considered further. Suffice it to say that none of the authorities support the proposition that, in circumstances where a non-publication order precludes dissemination to persons outside the Commission, the applicant has a reasonable excuse to refuse to answer questions.

Conclusions
56For the reasons set out above, the trial judge was correct to dismiss the challenge to the determination of the Commission. This Court should make the following orders:

(1) Order that publication of the name, and disclosure of other information tending to reveal the identity, of the applicant (who may be referred to by the letters SD) be prohibited.

(2) Grant the applicant leave to appeal.

(3) Direct that the amended draft notice of appeal filed on 12 December 2012 stand as the notice of appeal.

(4) Dismiss the appeal.

(5) Order the appellant to pay the respondent's costs of the proceedings in this Court.

57MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Basten JA.

58BARRETT JA: I agree that the orders proposed by Basten JA should be made. I can state my reasons briefly. I do so as if the provisions of the New South Wales Crime Commission Act 1985 had not been superseded by those of the Crime Commission Act 2012. 

59As it applies in relation to ""any evidence given before"" the Commission, s13(9) of the New South Wales Crime Commission Act has two aspects. If certain circumstances exist, the Commission must make a non-publication direction in relation to the evidence. Where those circumstances do not exist, the Commission may, but need not, make such a direction.

60The Commission is compelled to direct non-publication of evidence given before it if failure to do so might produce prejudice of a kind referred to in the closing words of s 13(9), including prejudice to the fair trial of a person who has been or may be charged with an offence. In considering whether to make a direction where the possibility of relevant prejudice is suggested, the Commission must therefore come to a view about the capacity of publication of the particular evidence to cause such prejudice.

61Where circumstances do not compel action by the Commission and the making of a direction is a matter of discretion only, the decision whether to make a non-publication direction in relation to evidence given will be informed principally by the need to preserve the integrity and efficacy of the relevant investigation, that is, the investigation referred to in s 13(1): see, for example, Gangemi v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2003] FCA 494; (2003) 129 FCR 284 (at [37]). And generally speaking, the person giving evidence will be in no position to know what is required for the protection of the integrity and efficacy of the investigation.

62The present proceedings concern the first aspect of s 13(9). It was accepted before the primary judge that, although the applicant had not been charged with any offence, he was, in terms of the section, ""a person who . . . may be charged with an offence"". The Commission was therefore obliged to make a non-publication direction in respect of ""any evidence given before it"" by the applicant if failure to make the direction might prejudice the fair trial of the applicant. 

63Before the applicant was examined on 6 August 2012, the Commission took certain action purportedly by reference to s 13(9): see [10] of Basten JA's reasons. The applicant was then asked certain questions and gave certain answers. Further action apparently based on s 13(9) was taken upon a resumption of the hearing on 15 August 2012: see [11] of Basten JA's reasons. There is no need to consider precisely what legal effect, if any, the directions of 6 and 15 August 2012 produced. It was (and is) common ground that the directions did not have the effect of prohibiting publication of the applicant's evidence to the police or the Director of Public Prosecutions.

64When, on 15 August 2012, the applicant was asked the two further questions referred to by Basten JA at [4], he declined to answer. His contention was (and is) that, because no s 13(9) direction had been made in terms that prohibited publication of his evidence to the police and the Director of Public Prosecutions, he had, in terms of s 18(2), ""reasonable excuse"" for refusing or failing to answer those two further questions. 

65I am of the opinion that, on any meaning of ""reasonable excuse"", the absence of a non-publication direction in the terms the applicant wished to see in force did not constitute ""reasonable excuse"" for his refusal or failure to answer the two particular questions.

66The task of the Commission under the relevant part of s 13(9) is, in the first instance, to consider whether failure to make a non-publication direction in respect of ""any evidence given before it"" might prejudice the fair trial of a person who may be charged with an offence. Only if the Commission decides that failure to direct non-publication might have that effect is it compelled to direct non-publication. 

67The Commission cannot address the question of the possible or likely impact of publication on a fair trial except by reference to the particular ""evidence given before it"". Evidence will commonly consist, as here, of questions and answers to them. Only if the answer to a question, as well as the question itself, is before the Commission can it consider the possible or likely consequences of publication of the evidence. It follows that a direction cannot be made in respect of an answer not yet given - also that a person giving evidence cannot, as it were, bargain in advance so as to be able to give answers only after a direction has been made in respect of evidence consisting of future answers and the questions to which they will respond.

68To take an example apposite to the circumstances of this case, if a person giving evidence at a hearing is asked whether he or she was at a particular place on a particular occasion, a positive answer might differ radically from a negative answer when it comes to an assessment of the capacity of the evidence constituted by the question and answer to prejudice a fair trial of the person. That assessment could only be made by reference to both the question asked and the answer given. 

69A person giving evidence at a hearing has no choice but to accept the statutory scheme, of which Kirby J said in Dalton v New South Wales Crime Commission [2006] HCA 17; (2006) 80 ALJR 860 (at [64]): 

""The 'right to silence' and to put the prosecution to proof of serious criminal accusations that may be made against a person summoned (or the family or associates of that person) are severely modified by the State Act.""

70In relation to an answer yet to be given by a person giving evidence at a hearing, the person has several important assurances: first, the assurance provided by s 13(3) that the hearing will be held in private; second, the assurance provided by s 18B as to very restricted admissibility of that evidence in legal and disciplinary proceedings (reinforced by what is effectively a right of appeal under s 19); and, third, the assurance that comes from the secrecy and proper purpose obligations imposed by s 29 on members of the Commission and its staff and certain other persons - plus, of course, the knowledge that the question of a s 13(9) non-publication direction may be raised with the Commission after the answer has been given. 

71This last matter is significant. It does not rest on mere hope of indulgence. Section 13(9) compels the making of a non-publication direction where failure to act might prejudice a fair trial of the person who has been or may be charged with an offence; and a person giving evidence should assume that the Commission will do its duty. Kirby and Callinan JJ observed, in this connection, in Z v New South Wales Crime Commission [2007] HCA 7; (2007) 231 CLR 75 (at [15]): 

""It must also be postulated that the commission would take proper precautions for the subsequent security of such information and for the observance of restrictions on those having access to such materials."" 

72For present purposes, the determinative point is that, when the applicant failed or refused to answer the two particular questions on 15 August 2012, no occasion had arisen for the Commission to make the s 13(9) direction the applicant sought concerning the evidence consisting of the two questions and the answers to them. This was because that evidence did not then exist so as to be capable of being assessed by the Commission in the necessary way. Absence of a direction precluding publication to the police and the Director of Public Prosecutions of evidence consisting of the questions and the answers yet to be given did not constitute, in terms of s 18(2), ""reasonable excuse"" for the applicant's refusal or failure to answer the questions. 

73It is unnecessary to consider other questions canvassed in the course of the hearing, including whether the Commission itself, being a corporation (s 5(1)), is bound by a s 13(9) direction so as to be criminally liable under s 13(12) in case of contravention of the direction; and whether a s 13(9) direction can, in effect, alter what would otherwise be the statutory functions and duties of the Commission by precluding certain forms of communication (or publication) that the Commission would otherwise be free or bound to make (compare, in relation to similar provisions of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth), Australian Crime Commission v OK [2010] FCAFC 61; (2010) 185 FCR 258, R v CB; MP v R [2011] NSWCCA 264 and R v Seller; R v McCarthy [2013] NSWCCA 42).

2707040,R v Tuki (No. 2) [2013] NSWSC 196,"Judgment

1JOHNSON J: On 23 November 2012, I found the Accused, Ray Tuki, unfit to be tried on a number of serious charges before this Court, including murder: R v Tuki [2012] NSWSC 1436. That judgment set out the background to the finding made, including an earlier finding by the District Court that Mr Tuki was unfit to be tried on District Court matters, and subsequent hearings and decisions of the Mental Health Review Tribunal (""MHRT"").

2Under s.14 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, a consequence of a finding of unfitness is that proceedings brought against Mr Tuki must not be continued, with Mr Tuki being referred to the MHRT in accordance with s.16 of that Act. 

3Last week, the Court was provided with the findings and reasons of the MHRT dated 28 February 2013, with respect to Mr Tuki. Put shortly, the MHRT has found that Mr Tuki is fit to be tried for the District Court and Supreme Court charges. 

4When the MHRT informs the Court that an accused person (who has previously been found unfit to be tried) is now fit to be tried, several provisions of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 come into play. 

5Section 17 permits the Court to consider the making of an order granting bail, or ordering the detention of an accused person in a mental health facility. 

6Section 29(1) requires the Court to obtain the advice of the Director of Public Prosecutions (""DPP"") as to whether further proceedings will be taken against the accused person. I note that the Crown, on 7 March 2013, indicated an intention to proceed further against Mr Tuki. 

7If the DPP is to proceed, s.29(1) requires the Court to hold a further inquiry as to the person's fitness as soon as practicable. 

8Section 30 provides that if, after the further inquiry, the accused person is found fit to be tried, the proceedings brought against the person are to recommence or continue in accordance with the appropriate criminal procedures. 

9Section 30 makes further provision in the event that the accused person is found unfit to be tried. 

10The District Court charges are next before that Court on 15 April 2013. Mr Tuki is to be further examined by Dr Adam Martin, forensic psychiatrist, on 13 March 2013, for the purpose of the forthcoming s.29 fitness inquiry in the District Court. 

11The trial of several co-accused of Mr Tuki, namely, John Khoury, Mohammed Karimi and Mahdi Mir, was listed to commence today, with a seven-to-eight week estimate. 

12When it became known to the Court that the MHRT considered Mr Tuki fit to be tried, I raised with affected parties (including Mr Winch, counsel who had appeared for Mr Tuki at the fitness inquiry in November 2012) what steps were open to the Court in the circumstances. 

13If the Court was informed of a finding of the MHRT concerning fitness some distance out from the listed trial, then the Court could have determined the fitness issue as soon as practicable (as required by s.29(1)(b)) with the view to joining Mr Tuki to the trial, if a finding of fitness was made.

14Mr Tuki is charged with some eight offences which relate to the same subject matter as the charges against Mr Khoury, Mr Karimi and Mr Mir. But for the fitness issue, the four men would be standing trial together. 

15To allow the Court to consider the appropriate course, the trial of Mr Khoury, Mr Karimi and Mr Mir has been put back to this Wednesday, 13 March 2013. 

16There would be considerable benefit if the trial of the four men proceeded together, with witnesses being called at that trial and with no separate trial of Mr Tuki being required.

17However, there are a number of factors which operate against that approach. 

18It will be necessary for the Court to first determine the fitness of Mr Tuki to be tried. The MHRT material is available to the Court. However, Dr Martin (who examined Mr Tuki for the purpose of the earlier fitness inquiry) is to see him this Wednesday. The legal representatives for Mr Tuki should have a reasonable opportunity to prepare for the further inquiry, including obtaining evidence from Dr Martin. 

19This means that the inquiry could take place on or after Thursday of this week. If the Court finds Mr Tuki fit to be tried, then, and only then, would the power exist for the Court to order the joinder of Mr Tuki's trial to that of Mr Khoury, Mr Karimi and Mr Mir. 

20However, counsel for Mr Tuki has foreshadowed that time would be required to prepare for trial, including obtaining psychiatric opinion evidence concerning possible issues of mental illness and/or substantial impairment. 

21If Mr Tuki gave notice of an intention to rely upon such evidence, the Crown would need an opportunity to have him psychiatrically examined for the Crown prior to trial. 

22I note that counsel for Mr Khoury, Mr Karimi and Mr Mir have indicated that there is no issue of mental illness or substantial impairment to be raised at their trial. 

23If the trial of the three men was deferred, pending the resolution of Mr Tuki's situation, then the trial would be placed on hold for a period of at least some weeks. 

24The Crown is ready to proceed with the trial of Mr Khoury, Mr Karimi and Mr Mir, as are counsel for each of those three accused. The Crown seeks to proceed with that trial and does not submit that the trial ought be deferred pending the (possible) future joinder of the charges against Mr Tuki.

25There are potentially different issues which would be raised if Mr Tuki was joined to this trial, involving mental illness and/or substantial impairment issues, which are not otherwise issues in the trial. 

26The temporal coincidence between recent developments concerning Mr Tuki and the MHRT, and the listed joint trial of the three accused, has required the Court to consider what approach ought to be taken.

27In the result, I have determined that the joint trial of the three accused ought proceed this Wednesday, and that the Court should move to determine Mr Tuki's fitness as soon as practicable, but separately from the trial. 

28I direct that the fitness inquiry with respect to Mr Tuki be listed at 2.00 pm this Friday, 15 March 2013. 

29I note that counsel for Mr Tuki will seek to obtain from Dr Martin information concerning his assessment with respect to the fitness of Mr Tuki. It is highly desirable that any report of Dr Martin be available at the earliest available time. 

30It may be that the simplest course, if it is the opinion of Dr Martin that Mr Tuki is fit to be tried, is that Dr Martin could attend at 2.00 pm on Friday to give some short evidence. I leave that as an option which would be satisfactory to the Court, if Dr Martin was of the opinion that the Accused is fit to be tried. However, a report is the preferred option, and any such report should be served on the Crown and provided to my Associate. 

31If the fitness inquiry does not proceed to a conclusion this Friday, I will determine it as soon as practicable thereafter, consistent with the obligation of the Court under the legislation. 

32Bail is refused with respect to Mr Tuki.

2707044,R v Jamal [2013] NSWDC 20,"Judgment

R v SALEH JAMAL

Introduction

1The accused pleaded ""not guilty"" on 21 February 2013 to a charge preferred on indictment alleging that he: ""On the 1st November 1998, at Lakemba in the State of New South Wales did fire a firearm in or near a public place, being Gillies Street, Lakemba."" 

2The trial was one by ""Judge alone"" pursuant to ss 132-133 Criminal Procedure Act 1986.

3The charge is concerned with a shooting at and around the Lakemba Police Station in Gillies Street Lakemba in the early hours of 1 November 1998. It is agreed between the parties that this event involved the participation of a number of people. The crime was a very violent crime that struck at civil order, challenged law enforcement agencies, and potentially put lives at risk. The details of the shooting incident from eye witnesses are in the 'Admitted Facts' tendered by the prosecution set out below.

4The Crown case against this accused is that he was not one of those who discharged firearms, but was part of a 'joint criminal enterprise' to commit the crime in that he was involved in preparations for it, he assisted the execution of the crime, perhaps by monitoring a police scanner, waiting nearby to the shooting ready to assist, knowing that the crime had been committed and by assisting the principal ""shooters"" to escape. The principals were part of a criminal group called ""DK's Boys"". The Crown produced evidence of two motives, possibly three. The evidence of motive(s) expressed before the shooting suggested anger at treatment of (young) Lebanese people in the Lakemba area by the police and the need to make ""a statement"" and/or was related to police activities directed at Tony Haddad (involved in car repair and rebirthing), an associate of the alleged gunmen, who lived in Wiley Park. A second (or third) motive arises from an alleged admission by the accused months after the event that he wanted to get the police off ""his (or our) back(s)"", his smash repair business having been raided on 14 October 1998. 

5The Crown relies upon oral evidence and photographic evidence, to show that Mr Jamal was an associate of the criminal group at the time of the Lakemba shooting. The photograph(s) do not establish this, as such, as nobody knows precisely when they were taken. But one photo of the accused shows him in company of members or associates of the group. The principal witnesses Alan Rossini, Peter Laycock and Dennis Green were members of the group, although Green played no role in the events of 31 October/November 1998 at Lakemba. The evidence of admission was given by Mr Kennedy (a criminal associate of the accused). All civilian witnesses had pseudonyms when giving evidence. 

6As to the accused's role in the joint criminal enterprise, stated simply, proof of guilt relied principally upon the accounts of Rossini and Laycock with purported support from Mr Green (of the accused's presence at a relevant planning meeting) and Mr Kennedy (of the admission(s) made by the accused). If one was satisfied of Mr Jamal's presence in the company of the' shooters' before the shooting, as they armed themselves, as they discussed their plans to shoot the police station, driving them nearby to the scene to pick up a stolen car and waiting for them to drive them away after the shooting, the relevant knowledge and relevant intention to participate in the joint criminal enterprise would follow as a matter of common sense. Of that there was no dispute at trial. 

7The prosecution case had no evidence independent of the civilian witnesses to place the accused in the company of the shooters in circumstances which would establish relevant knowledge, intention and participation. It produced independent evidence to establish Laycock's, and thus Rossini's, involvement from the CCTV photos taken of Laycock buying a petrol can at a service station on Canterbury Road before the shooting. A stolen car used by the shooters was burnt afterwards by use of petrol, the can used was found at the scene. 

8The Crown case relies upon accepting the truthfulness of Mr Rossini, and in so doing relying upon the truthfulness of the evidence of Laycock and Green to support him materially, although their evidence in different ways is relied upon as direct evidence of participation by the accused in the criminal enterprise.

9The evidence of the ex post facto statement made to Kennedy, if accepted, is capable of supporting the essence of Rossini's account in a general sense. On the other hand, even accepting that the words were said, one would have to accept that the admission was true and not boasting or ""grandstanding"" on the part of the accused.

10The context or background to the charge brought against the accused is the activities of a criminal gang or group that was controlled by a man called Danny Karam until he was murdered by members of the group in December 1998 at Surry Hills. This criminal group existed at least during 1998 through to June 1999. On the basis of the evidence of Alan Rossini and his connection with it, it existed also in 1997. It was involved in a number of criminal activities in the period 1998 to 1999, but a central criminal activity was the supply of cocaine in the Kings Cross area. The evidence shows that members of the group and their associates were involved in murders, woundings of individuals by firearms, discharging of firearms in public places to intimidate others (or as revenge), dealing in stolen motor vehicles, supply of marijuana, physical assaults upon drug supply rivals and others, extortion, 'protection', significant firearms possession and the use, driving and destruction of stolen cars, amongst other criminal activities. The group had ""safe houses"", or establishments that they controlled, or occupied in the inner city and elsewhere. These places were, at various times, at Paddington, Surry Hills, Mays Hill, Haymarket, Campsie and elsewhere. At these places from time to time were kept prohibited drugs and firearms. The principal 'safe house' in this matter was 343-349 Riley Street, Surry Hills (the Surry Hills apartment). In October/November 1998 that apartment (in the Mayfair/Addison Apartments) was where cocaine was packaged and where a number of firearms were kept. These included handguns, an 'AK47' and shotguns. 

11Danny Karam, was the head of the organisation until his death in mid December 1998. His main lieutenants were Michael Kanaan, Alan Rossini, Wassim El-Assad and Rabeeh Mawas. Other people with prominent roles in the group were Charlie Gea Gea and Ghassan Said, generally referred to as 'Easy'. Shardi Derbas, 'Hass' or 'Has' and Tony Haddad (who lived in Wiley Park) were nominated as associates by Rossini or Laycock, amongst others. Saleh Jamal was clearly an associate, but his role within the group was a matter of some dispute. There was some conflict in the evidence about the roles of people other than Kanaan, El-Assad, Mawas and Rossini. Rossini described himself and others as 'lieutenants' to Danny Karam, including the accused, Gea Gea and Easy as lieutenants as well. Other assessments placed Kanaan above Rossini who was above El-Assad and Mawas. There was no formal 'organisation chart', but of the leading roles of Rossini and Kanaan I have no doubt. Although Mr Rossini could be said to have made many frank admissions about his role within the group, there was a strong impression that whilst he was willing to take general responsibility, in specific instances he attributed blame or responsibility to others in circumstances at odds with his capabilities and interests in the group's activities. The critical matter, however, was understanding the relationship of the accused with the group at what could be called the relevant time, late October, early November 1998.

12Mr Rossini placed the accused as an active participant in the central criminal activity of the gang, supplying cocaine, making him out to be one of the 'Boys'. Apart from some suggestion in the evidence of a minor role in that regard by him, in that he sourced cocaine on one occasion, there was no support in the evidence of Mr Laycock or Mr Green that the accused was substantially involved in this core activity. Special rings were made with an inscription 'DK' and other writing, to signify membership of the group. Mr Jamal was not the recipient of such a ring from Danny Karam .Special tattoos were acquired by at least some of the 'Boys'. Not Jamal apparently. In fact, up until Karam's murder in December 1998, no witness refers to Jamal being in Karam's company. The accused was know as ""Ray"" or ""Saleh"" or ""Sully"" by members of the group. I am prepared to accept that Mr Jamal was an associate of the group and given his contact with it, would have been aware of some of its criminal activities. There was evidence that he was directly involved in dealing with stolen cars, ""rebirthing"" as it was referred to, and at least from January 1999 was involved in the supply of marijuana. He was involved in the shooting of Elias Elias in 1998. Many of these activities, however, were not integral to the criminal activities of DK's Boys. Involvement in car rebirthing could assist the criminal group in its various activities, particularly given its need from time to time for stolen cars to commit to various crimes. Rossini did not give a specific instance of this activity by the accused. In fact, he said that Tony Haddad, who was involved in car theft and rebirthing, was the source of the stolen car used in the crime with which this trial is concerned, as he had been on other occasions.

13Around the events giving rise to the count in the indictment, the group was involved in particular criminal enterprises, many of which I note in passing did not allegedly involve the accused, but which were are relevant in assessing the truthfulness, reliability, accuracy and general credibility of the witnesses Rossini, Laycock and Green. Both Laycock and Green were acolytes of the group who were connected from different perspectives. Laycock was Rossini's cousin and was employed by him no later than August 1998 as a driver and messenger. His role in the group increased after Karam died, to the point where he played an active role as an enforcer, particularly in the discipline of runners. He sought to portray himself as feckless, disinterested and merely a 'catch and fetch dogsbody'. Whilst he may have been that in 1998, in 1999 he was more important and had more independence, although he was still at the direction principally of Rossini and Kanaan. Mr Green in 1998 was a runner distributing cocaine at street level. When he became a manager for the group after Karam died he had more authority and over a six-month period, at least, regularly carried a firearm to enforce that authority. 

14Amongst the principal criminal offences that were referred to in the evidence as committed or by involving this criminal group (or Rossini particularly) were:



the murder of Adam Wright and Michael Hurl and the attempted murder of another man outside a hotel in Five Dock (the Five Dock matter) in July 1998 
the shooting at and around the EP1 nightclub in King's Cross in September 1998 
the shooting of Elias Elias at Greenacre on 13 October 1998 
false alibi for the person responsible for the murder of Edward Lee (a schoolboy) on 17 October 1998, 
the shooting at Lakemba police station on one November 1998, 
the discharge of firearms in Everleigh Street Redfern on 11 November 1998 
the murder of Danny Karam on 13 December 1998 
the attempted murder of two police officers in a Rushcutters Bay (the White City matter) on 23 December 1998. 

15There were other crimes are admitted by Rossini and Laycock around this period, but many of the above mentioned crimes were matters about which they gave induced statements and are protected from prosecution.

16In addition to the activities of the group, or of individuals identified in the trial, with varying degrees of detail, there were some other relevant events. These included, the arrest of Michael Kanaan on 23 December 1998 (over the White City shooting, he being severely wounded) and his release to bail on 5 March 1999, the arrest of Rossini, Laycock and Green on a charge of conspiracy to supply a commercial quantity of cocaine on 1 June 1999, the 'rollover' of Laycock in early June 1999 followed by the 'rollover' of Rossini, Rossini giving evidence at the New South Wales Crime Commission in early July 1999, the arrest of the accused on 16 July 1999 in relation to other offences and his arrest in relation to the current matter on 17 September 1999. 

17Mr Rossini gave evidence at committal proceedings regarding the Lakemba matter on 13 November 2000, Laycock on 14 November 2000. Alan Rossini gave evidence at the Karam's murder trial, involving Kanaan, El-Assad and Mawas in late April 2002, Laycock gave evidence at the same trial in May 2002. Then there was a 2004 trial in relation to the Lakemba shooting involving Kanaan, El-Assad and the accused. Only Rossini gave evidence before the jury was discharged. Then there was a trial in May 2005 of Kanaan and El-Assad of this matter at which Rossini and Laycock gave evidence, as did Dennis Green. There finally was a trial of the accused in November 2009 in relation to the Lakemba matter, at which Rossini gave evidence on 9 November 2009 and Laycock gave evidence on 10 November 2009. The accused was convicted. The specific charges brought against particular people for the 'Lakemba matter' have apparently varied, but are not important at this point. I had not read the judgement of the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in respect of Mr Jamal's successful appeal against his conviction before this trial commenced and have not read it subsequently. I had tried Mr Kanaan and the accused for the shooting of Elias Elias. Both men were found guilty by a jury and I sentenced them both. Naturally, I have a general recollection of that trial, and some recollection of the detail of the trial, but I have not refreshed my memory from my sentencing remarks, or the summing up. No application was made by either party for me to disqualify myself because I had presided over that trial. The detail of that event has only been a peripheral to the issues in this trial, primarily in relation to the credibility of Mr Rossini. But as no evidence from that trial was the subject of significant cross-examination of Mr Rossini or Mr Laycock, those proceedings ultimately were of no significance whatsoever in this trial.

18Apart from the civilian witnesses to give evidence, the current officer in charge, Detective Senior Sergeant Mackenzie, gave evidence of matters that emerged from the police investigation in 1998/1999, as well as some additional evidence such as a motor vehicles registered in the name of the accused in 1998. The motor vehicles that the accused acquired, from 1996 up until his arrest in July 1999, were, a Mitsubishi Lancer sedan, a Holden Barina sedan and a Mitsubishi Magna sedan. No four-wheel-drive vehicles of the types described by Mr Rossini and Mr Laycock were registered to the accused. However, although it was not the subject of particular address, I understand that the evidence suggested, even established, that the accused had access to other motor vehicles, including stolen and rebirthed motor vehicles. He also was connected to, or had an ""interest"" in, President Smash Repairs, a business at 69 Rosedale Avenue Greenacre which was searched by police on 14 October 1998 in relation to an operation relating to stolen cars, from which two motor vehicles were seized. No person was arrested or charged in relation to this action. Although the relationship of the prisoner with the business is not precisely defined, even in Mr Kennedy's evidence which is concerned with late January 1999 onwards, the accused had a connection with that business at that time and was observed coming and going from the business in mid July 1999, the day before his arrest.

19The evidence of ""bad character"" of the accused led by the Crown was relevant to establishing a connection with DK's Boys at the relevant period of late October or early November 1998, to establish a motive on the part of the accused to be part of a criminal enterprise to shoot at the Lakemba Police Station and to show the capacity of the prisoner to have access to motor vehicles that may be used in the criminal enterprise and items such as a police scanner, as alleged by Mr Rossini. Certainly, it was not the Crown's contention that ""tendency"" or ""coincidence ""evidence was relevant or admissible in relation to these matters. 


LEGAL PRINCIPLES TO BE APPLIED

20The matters outlined below are primarily related to matters addressed upon. Not a great deal of attention was taken by the parties to legal issues as most legal issues appeared to be agreed amongst the parties at the end of the evidence, particularly on fundamental issues, although, of course, a number of legal issues arose during the trial. There was no issue as to the elements of the offence charged. Their meaning was self evidently reflected in the events set out in the agreed facts. 

Onus and standard of proof of guilt

21The prosecution bears the burden of proving the guilt of the accused. That burden or onus rests with the prosecution throughout the trial in respect of matters regarding proof by the prosecution. The accused bears no onus of proof. The accused is presumed to be innocent until such time as the prosecution can prove his guilt.

22The prosecution must prove each and all essential ingredients of a relevant charge for consideration 'beyond reasonable doubt'. Those words are to be given their ordinary, everyday meaning. The accused bears no onus in relation to any matters requiring proof by the prosecution. If any reasonable doubt exists in relation to matters which the prosecution must prove to establish guilt, then I must acquit the accused. Here there was not doubt that 'a firearm' was 'fired' in or near 'a public place' in Gillies Street Lakemba, and that was unlawful. The issue for determination was whether the prosecution had proven that the accused was part of a joint criminal enterprise for this crime to be committed. 

Trial by judge alone

23The trial is a trial by judge alone in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act (see s 132, 133 Criminal Procedure Act 1986). A trial by judge alone requires the trial judge not just to state bare principles of law that are applied and findings of fact that are made, but also to expose the ""reasoning process"" justifying the findings of fact and ultimately the verdict. 

24All principles of law which are relevant and required to be applied and considered should be identified in the judgment, including any necessary warnings that the trial judge is required to apply in the assessment of the evidence. Where particular warnings are applied a judge must state why, if appropriate and applicable, and notwithstanding the appropriate warnings or the consequences of it, a particular verdict has been reached (Fleming v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 250 (at 261-264)). 

Prior inconsistent statements

25Prior inconsistent statements or statements made on previous occasions may be referred to to establish inconsistencies between those accounts and the evidence of a witness in this Court. What is said by a witness on a previous occasion is not itself evidence of the fact unless, of course, the previous statement is adopted in this Court. If there is an inconsistency between a previous statement or evidence and evidence in this Court it may be taken into account in either assessing the credibility of the particular witness in relation to that particular matter or in assessing the credibility of the witness generally. In considering such inconsistencies one may, if satisfied that there are inconsistencies, regard those matters as reflecting adversely upon the truthfulness of the witness. The significance of these matters in relation to a particular witness will depend upon the significance of the inconsistency, the number of inconsistencies and of course the significance of the witness in the case. 

The silent accused

26The accused did not give evidence. The accused bears no onus of proof. The accused is presumed to be innocent until satisfied by the Crown that he is guilty. Consistent with this, the accused is entitled to elect to say nothing and to make the Crown prove his guilt. The accused in this trial has chosen, as is his right to do so, not to say anything in Court. An accused person cannot be compelled in Court to say anything. Neither can the accused be compelled out of Court to say anything. 

27I cannot draw any adverse inference against the accused because he has exercised his right to silence in Court. I must not speculate as to why the accused has not given evidence. Furthermore, I must not treat the accused's election not to give evidence as being capable of filling any gaps in the Crown case that you may perceive to exist. 

Joint criminal enterprise

28Where two or more persons carry out a joint criminal enterprise, that is an agreement to carry out a particular criminal activity, each is held to be criminally responsible for the acts of another participant in carrying out that enterprise or activity. This is so regardless of the particular role played in that enterprise by any particular participant. The Crown must establish both the existence of a joint criminal enterprise and the participation in it by the accused. 

29A joint criminal enterprise exists where two or more persons reach an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement between them that they will commit a crime. The agreement need not be expressed in words, and its existence may be inferred from all the facts and circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence that are found proved on the evidence. 

30The agreement need not have been reached at any particular point in time before the crime is committed, provided that at the time of the commission of the crime the participants have agreed that the crime should be committed by any one or all of them. 

31The circumstances in which two or more persons are participating together in the commission of a particular crime may themselves establish that at some point in time an agreement has been reached between them that the crime should be committed. 

32It does not matter whether the agreed crime is committed by only one or some of the participants in the joint criminal enterprise, or whether they all played an active part in committing that crime. All of the participants in the enterprise are equally guilty of committing the crime regardless of the actual part played by each in its commission. 

33The Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the crime which was the subject of the joint agreement was in fact committed. It therefore must prove beyond reasonable doubt that each of the essential facts or ingredients, which make up that crime, was committed, regardless of who actually committed them. Further in respect of a particular accused, the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that he, or she, was a participant in the commission of that crime as part of a joint criminal enterprise with one or more persons.

Warning re: reliability of the civilian witnesses

34In respect of the evidence of Peter Laycock and Alan Rossini they are both witnesses are witnesses who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding. They are also informers, in a general sense, as are Mr Green and Mr Kennedy. The four main witnesses in the prosecution case have each been the beneficiary of various advantages and benefits as a result of their willingness to give evidence in this and other matters. 

35In summary, Mr Rossini was given an indemnity under the relevant provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act applicable in October 1999, in respect of the offence of conspiracy to supply not less than the commercial quantity of cocaine and ""any associated offences in respect of matters relevant to the said proceedings and covered by your evidence in the said proceedings"", on the condition that until the conclusion of all criminal proceedings against various people, he participated in interviews and submit to relevant surveillance and direction. He was also given undertakings by the then Attorney General, pursuant to the then relevant provision in the Criminal Procedure Act, that his evidence and other matters would not be used in proceedings against him, except in respect of the falsity of his evidence, if he gave evidence in criminal proceedings brought against this accused, Michael Kanaan (and others) for various offences arising from the ""drive-by shooting of the Lakemba police station on one November 1998"" and that he actively cooperate, provided, of course, that his evidence was ""the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth"". 

36He was given undertakings similarly in relation to a number of other offences including charges of attempted murder of police officers on 23 December 1998 (the White City matter) the drive-by shooting in Everleigh Street on 11 November 1998, the murder of Danny Karam on 13 December 1998, the shooting of the EP1 Nightclub in Kings Cross and 11 September 1998, the murders of Adam Wright and Michael Poole and the attempted murder of Ronald Singleton (the 'Five Dock' matters), amongst other matters. He signed an undertaking on 25 November 1999 to give evidence in any proceedings against the accused and others for offences arising out of the drive-by shooting of the Lakemba police station, in accordance with the statement given by him on a July 1999. He was also given the benefit in this trial of a s 128 certificate (Evidence Act 1995), because it was felt that evidence he was giving in respect of his various criminal activities might fall outside the protection of relevant indemnities and undertakings. The certificate is of little or no significance in these proceedings. 

37Mr Laycock received an indemnity against prosecution in identical terms, to all intents and purposes, with that received by Mr Rossini in 1999. An identical undertaking was given in relation to the ""Lakemba Police Station"" matter as was given to Mr Rossini. Other undertakings not to prosecute him were given in relation to the EP1 nightclub matter, the Everleigh Street Redfern matter, the murder of Danny Karam, and the various offences related to conspiracy to supply not less than the commercial quantity of cocaine between 1 January 1999 and 30 June 1999, amongst other matters. He received a s 128 certificate in this trial which is ultimately of no moment. Rossini and Laycock were not charged with any other offences other than those concerned with the supply of cocaine. Although they were charged in relation to offences relating to a ""commercial quantity"" of cocaine, there was evidence available of their involvement in the supply of a ""large commercial quantity"" of cocaine at the time they were given the indemnity against prosecution. Their evidence and that of Mr Green shows that they were concerned with significant cocaine supply in differing ways, for many months beyond the first five months of 1999. Any charges laid against Mr Rossini and Mr Laycock were withdrawn. They gave induced statements in relation to the various matters with which they were charged or given undertakings. They did spend several months in custody during which their protections from prosecution and relevant undertakings were sorted out.

38Mr Green received a discount for his cooperation and undertakings to give evidence having pleaded guilty to an offence of conspiracy to supply not less than the commercial quantity of cocaine. That discount was 50% in total, for his cooperation and the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty. Whilst the charge against him was conspiracy to supply not less than the commercial quantity of cocaine, the facts concerned events between mid April 1999 and the date of his arrest on 1 June 1999. He had been involved in this activity in 1998. The charge to which he pleaded guilty 'pleaded' a conspiracy between 1 January and 1 June 1999. He was not charged with other criminal offences. He likewise received the benefit of a s 128 certificate. 

39Mr Kennedy was not charged with any offence in relation to the circumstances of his connection with Mr Jamal. He was approached by police and ultimately gave an induced statement in relation to his involvement in cannabis supply with the accused, his knowledge of the accused's connection with President Smash Repairs and the Lakemba Police Station shooting and, perhaps, other matters. He was under police surveillance, prior to early June 1999. He knew he was at risk of arrest in relation to his marijuana supply activities. It was indicated to him, ""in not so many words"", that if he assisted the police, the police could assist him. This they did. He has never been charged with any crime in relation to his activities in 1999.

40The degree and character of benefit obviously varied from witness the witness. The greatest benefit was provided to Mr Rossini who was more criminally concerned in more crimes then the other three. Mr Laycock, although less criminally concerned, and involved in less crimes, on any measure received a very considerable benefit. The benefit to Mr Green was very significant, with a discount at the upper level of discounts available at that time he was sentenced in 2000 and was prosecuted on a limited basis. He obviously committed other crimes, but whether there was admissible evidence for them I do not know. Mr Kennedy also received a substantial benefit. He was not charged with any offence, and importantly, like the other witnesses, he received the benefit of an inducement that anything he said in his statement(s) could not be used in proceedings against him. Ultimately, he had the benefit of a section 128 certificate, like other witnesses, although I accept that he was willing to give evidence, whether he received a certificate or not.

41Their evidence for various reasons must be scrutinised with great care. Because of the circumstances in which these witnesses come forward their evidence may be unreliable. The witnesses in different ways and for different purposes may well be trying to exculpate themselves from the relevant events, or minimise their part, by fabricating the role or exaggerating the role of others. It is to be borne in mind, of course, that if they were in fact where as they claim they were they are in a position to relate details about what happened from their direct knowledge to give their version some credibility. Further, they may fabricate or exaggerate allegations out of spite, revenge or antipathy towards the accused, for reasons which are not known. There may be other reasons for them to falsely implicate the accused that are not readily apparent or, more importantly, incapable of exposure. The person who wishes to shift blame or falsely implicate another for his own benefit may be persuasive and be capable of pretending that they are truthful in their recounting of events. I need to scrutinise with great care to see if there is any evidence independent of both men that supports their version of events. They all have good reason to live up to the respective bargains they struck in 1999 and since. 

42In relation to the respective accounts of Mr Rossini, Mr Laycock and Mr Green, although there is no rule of law that a witness involved in criminality cannot support the evidence of another involved in the same criminality, one must be very careful before relying upon one such witness to support the others account and vice versa. The reason one must be careful before one can use the evidence of one to cross support the evidence of another includes:


i)they have contradicted one another as to some of the events occurring at the time of the shooting and afterwards,


ii)Rossini and Laycock are related to one another and know one another well.

43One should bear in mind that they have not only an interest in minimising their own roles but also in protecting each other from prosecution and imprisonment. 

44I appreciate there is no direct evidence of collusion. They deny it where it has been raised, or an awareness of what the other has said on a number of prior occasions. However, they were arrested around the same time, Rossini became aware that his cousin had rolled over before he offered assistance having learnt this from mutual family member(s), they have been in contact with one another since that time (on the account of Mr Laycock the last time approximately a month ago). Ultimately I am reliant upon their truthfulness as to whether, in fact, there has been collusion or contamination that has infected or affected their accounts. There is no evidence that collusion at particular times was impossible. Their truthfulness is very much an issue in the trial.

45The warning that is given in relation to such witnesses is born out of experiences of courts over many years in relation to the potential unreliability of those who wish to give evidence to fulfil some purpose or self benefit, rather than giving evidence for altruistic purposes. One must bear in mind that the evidence of Laycock and Rossini is not ""independent"" one to the other. The reasons which might exist to concoct evidence are much the same for both men. 

Forensic disadvantage

46Elsewhere in the judgement I deal with the effect of the effluxion of time upon memory and the effect of giving evidence on a number of occasions, in respect of this matter and on other topics. Of course, the effluxion of time has also meant that other evidence cannot be produced from investigating police and the like, who are no longer available. This may be a detriment to the accused in the conduct of his defence and in relation to appropriate and effective challenge of witnesses. However, it should be fairly observed, that the accused has had material upon which the evidence of the civilian witnesses could be challenged, contradicted or otherwise assessed. In fact the multitude of proceedings in relation to the Lakemba Police Station affair has provided material upon which the witnesses can be cross-examined about prior inconsistent statements, or reminded of evidence previously given which assisted the conduct of the defence case.

Admitted facts

47""Pursuant to section 184 of the Evidence Act 1995, and following advice from counsel, the accused admitted the following matters of fact:

(1)Mr Jamal was also known to friends and associates by the name of Ray. 

(2)At approximately 1:15am on Sunday, 1 November 1998, shots were fired at the Lakemba Police Station (""the station""), located on the corner of Gillies and Quigg Streets in Lakemba. 

Observations of Police 
(3)Upon hearing gun shots, Officer Rivers looked out the left hand window of the station front and saw red flames coming from a car as it was driving west on Gillies Street. He believed the car to be a sedan and observed it to be about seven metres away from the entrance of the station. The shots started coming rapidly. 

(4)Officer Blakely yelled ""Hit the deck"" and the five officers lay down on the floor of the station. 

(5)The shots were fired over a period of about 10 seconds. 

Photographs and Maps of Area
(6)(Tendered)

Eye Witness Evidence of the car leaving the scene 
(7)Immediately after the shooting, a number of witnesses in Haldon Street observed a black sedan travelling at speed down Gillies Street, turn right into Haldon Street and then turn left into Oneata Street. This was followed shortly after by a maroon late-model Holden sedan which travelled the same route at speed. No witness saw a white or black 4WD.

(8)Mr Mika Pritchard was working as a bouncer at the Lakemba Hotel on Haldon Street on the night of the shooting. From the front door of the Hotel, which faced straight down Gillies Street, he observed the maroon Holden sedan to have registration similar to ""PPJ"". He made a police statement to this effect on 3 November 1998.

(9)Mr Rimo Moeroa, from a position on the western kerb of Haldon Street, saw a black Commodore sedan screeching sideways around the corner, turning left from Haldon into a little side street, it looked out of control, as thought it were going to crash. The noise from the screeching wheels was very loud. The car had bad dents of the passenger side doors and dark tinted windows that he could see through. He saw the maroon sedan and saw a person in the front passenger seat of the maroon Holden sedan as it turned from Gillies Street into Haldon Street. On that day, he made a police statement and gave police the following description of the person in the front passenger seat of the maroon car: a man who looked in his early twenties, Lebanese, with black hair which was short on the sides and longer on the top, which was worn slicked back with gel. He was clean shaven and looked skinny. He was wearing a white collared shirt, and sunglasses. He couldn't see the person in the driver's seat or anyone else in the car. 

(10)Mr Memory Pedro Junior, spoke to police on 4 November 1998 and made a statement. From a position on the western kerb of Haldon Street, he saw a black small car turning left into Oneata Street. As it turned it screeched. This was 30 seconds after bangs he heard. Aftet another 30 seconds he saw the maroon car trun right from Gillies Street into Haldon Street. He saw person in the back left seat of the maroon Holden sedan as the car turned into Haldon Street. He could see the person's arms and saw white skin. He thinks the person was wearing a white t-shirt. He also saw a man in the front passenger seat who was holding on to the glove box. He could see that man's arms and he had white skin also.

(11)Ms Lucy Teariki, from a position on the western kerb of Haldon Street, saw three male persons in the rear of the maroon Holden sedan, and two male persons in the front. The person sitting in the front passenger seat she described as male, of Australian appearance, about 17 to 18 years old, slim to medium build, clean shaven, and waring a Nike brand woollen beanie with a white tick on the front. She can't describe anyone else in the car other than that they were male. Ms Teariki made a police statement on 4 November 1998.

(12)Ms Zara John, from a position on the western kerb of Haldon Street, noticed a man sitting in the back behind the front passenger seat of the maroon Holden sedan. He was male, about 19 years old, didn't have dark skin, and was wearing puffy white jacket similar to a bomber jacket. He also had a light coloured cap on which he was wearing back to front. She says she didn't really pay attention to the other people in the car, but can remember that there were four males in the car. She spoke to police on 1 November 1998 and made a statement on that day.

(13)Ms Heather Te Rangi was at a party at 60 Gillies Street. She heard a noise like firecrackers and about 20 seconds later she looked across a worksite next door. About 20 to 25 metres away from her she saw a man pointing something across the road and it looked like a rifle. He was pointing it towards the back of the shops towards the station. He ran towards Haldon Street and continued to point the gun across the road. She described the man as about 6 feet in height, well built, no hat and hair not worn long. She spoke to police and made a statement on 1 November 1998.

Ballistics Evidence

(14)Expert ballistic examination of the scene established that a minimum of sixteen shots were fired at the station. 

(15)The weapons used were firearms.

(16)There were thirteen bullet holes in the doors of the station. 

(17)Parked on the northern kerb at the front of the police station at the time of the shooting was a fully marked police vehicle, a Holden Commodore station wagon bearing NSW registration UUX-989. Bullet holes were located in the front driver's side door and off-side front bumper bar of the car. 

(18)A bullet hole was also located in the New South Wales Police Force plaque on the front brick wall of the station next to the front entrance doors. 

(19)Forensic examination of the projectiles seized by police from the scene of the shooting established that the shots were discharged from at least four, but possibly five, different weapons. Three of those weapons were 9mm handguns. One of those weapons was a 45mm handgun. 

(20)At least two projectiles were fired from one of the 9mm handguns, and at least four projectiles were fired from the two other 9mm handguns. At least two projectiles were fired from the 45mm handgun. 

(21)The 45mm handgun used in the shooting was seized by police at Weigall Sports Ground on 23 December 1998 in relation to another shooting incident at which Michael Kanaan and Wassim El-Assad were arrested at the scene. Alan Rossini was also present, had the handgun, threw it away and fled the scene.

(22)There is heat involved in the firing of a firearm due to the explosion and ignition of the gunpowder in the cartridge. The temperature of the fired cartridge reached is in the order of 500-800 degrees celcius.

Dog Tracking 

(23)At 1:50am on 1 November 1998, Senior Constable Phillip Maria attended Samuels Street, Wiley Park. He removed police dog Axle from his car and walked to a pedestrian walkway located at the western end of Samuel Street.

(24)The police dog was then placed into a tracking harness but was unable to locate any human scent in this area.

(25)They moved forwards on to King Georges Road. Again, the police dog was unable to locate human scent in this area.

(26)They moved in a straight line into the Wiley Park Public School. The police dog located human scent on the bitumen on the southern side of the public school. The dog followed this scent in a westerly direction, continuing along the bitumen and then on to a grassed area. The scent was followed over a small fence and into Denman Avenue, Wiley Park. At this stage the track was lost.

Burnt out Cars in Samuel Street

(27)Mr William Sikahele was the owner of the maroon Holden Commodore bearing NSW registration PPY-099. At about 7pm on Saturday, 31 October 1998, Mr Sikahele parked his car in a garage situated in his unit complex at 10 Renown Avenue, Wiley Park. The car was locked and a club lock was placed on the car's steering wheel. Mr Sikahele did not return to the garage until after 8pm on 1 November 1998, when he noticed the car was missing and there was broken glass on the floor of the garage.

(28)At 1:25am on Sunday, 1 November 1998 a call was made to triple 0, alerting them to a car on fire in Samuel Street, Wiley Park.

(29)Members of the NSW Fire Brigade arrived in Samuel Street at 1:34am and saw two cars parked alongside each other alight: a 1982 white Ford Falcon, bearing NSW registration number MXE-486, and a maroon V6 1989 model Holden Commodore sedan, with no registration plates. The fire was extinguished.

(30)Located a short distance from the Holden Commodore was a NSW registration plate number PPY-099 which had been scorched by fire.

(31)The white Ford Falcon was owned by Nick Xenos. He had parked his car at the end of Samuel Street at 8:45pm on 31 October 1998. There was severe fire damage to the offside of that car and the interior was completely gutted by fire. The fire damage occasioned to the offside of the car was as a result of radiant heat from the Holden Commodore.

(32)The maroon Holden Commodore was completely destroyed by fire. Forensic experts were unable to establish the fire points of origin in the car due to the complete destruction of the interior. However, an empty 5-litre petrol can was located on the driver's seat of the car. 

(33)The ash and debris, metal and glass fragments from the floor and seat areas within the car was sifted and no evidence was located which would assist the investigation. 

(34)A photograph of Mr Sikahele's car is attached.

7-Eleven Purchases 

(35)Shortly after midnight on Saturday 31 October 1998, a dark skinned male entered the 7-Eleven convenience store and petrol station located at the intersection of Canterbury Road and Chapel Street in Lakemba.

(36)The male asked the cashier whether he sold empty petrol cans. The cashier informed him that he did and pointed to the first aisle in the store. The male picked up a 5-litre silver petrol can and returned to the counter where he purchased the can for $6.95 and another item for $2.50 with a $20 note. This purchase was made at 12:17am.

(37)The male left the store and walked over to a petrol bowser where he proceeded to fill up the can with petrol. 

(38)The male returned to the store and paid $3.27 for 4.89 litres of petrol. This purchase was also made with cash and was made at 12:20am.

(39)There were no other purchases of petrol cans from the store on this night.

(40)CCTV stills from the 7-Eleven store depicting these two transactions are attached.

(41)The cans sold at the 7-Eleven store are of the same colour and manufacture as the petrol can located on the driver's seat of the Holden Commodore which was destroyed by fire in Samuel Street.

Croydon Park Ex-Servicemen's Club 

(42)On 31 October 1998, there was an engagement party for relatives of the witnesses known as ROSSINI and LAYCOCK held at the Croydon Park Ex-Servicemen's Club.

(43)The function started at 6:00pm.

Adeel's Palace Photo 

(44)In the evening of 28 November 1998, a photograph was taken of a group of men seated at a table at the Adeel's Palace restaurant, located at the corner of Highclere Avenue and Breust Place in Punchbowl.

(45)The persons depicted in that photo, from left to right, are: Rabeeh MAWAS, Danny KARAM, Charlie GEAGEA, Michael KANAAN, Alan ROSSINI, Alex TAOUIL, and Wassim EL-ASSAD. The people depicted in this photo were members of ""DKs Boys"". 

President Smash Repairs

(46)On 14 and 15 October 1998, a police operation named ""Mao"" was conducted. During that operation a large number of panel beating businesses within the Bankstown Local Area Command were visited and inspected by police and authorised inspectors from the Motor Vehicle Repair Industry Council. 

(47)On 14 October 1998, police inspected President Smash Repairs at 69 Rosedale Avenue, Greenacre and seized two cars. No person was charged as a result of this action.

(48)On 14 July 1999, police observed the accused driving a 1977 Subaru Impreza, NSW registration VSD-577, to President Smash Repairs.

(49)On 15 July 1999, police observed the accused driving the same car from Rosedale Avenue, Greenacre to 21 Boronia Street, Belfield.

Arrest of Accused 

(50)Early in the afternoon of 15 July 1999, the accused was stopped in the city, arrested and conveyed to the Sydney Police Centre. In his possession was a set of house keys which police later used to gain entry to premises situated at 21 Boronia Street, Belfield.

Search of 21 Boronia Street, Belfield 

(51)At about 5:00pm on 15 July 1999, police conducted a search, pursuant to a search warrant, of the house at 21 Boronia Street, Belfield.

(57)The accused stayed at the premises at 21 Boronia Street, Belfield and the above seized items were in his possession."" 

A summary of the accounts given by civilian witnesses

48I do not propose to summarize all the evidence of the witnesses. Many of the matters raised in the evidence are picked up in the later consideration of it, or in summarizing the submissions or encapsulated in the earlier part of the judgment. But to understand some of the key aspects of the matter the evidence from the civilian witnesses implicating the accused needs to be set out in summary.

Rossini

49Mr Rossini's version of events is that a week or to before the shooting there was a discussion at the apartment at Surry Hills to discuss shooting the Lakemba Police Station. People present were Michael Kanaan, Wassim El-Assad, Charlie Mawas, Easy, himself and the accused. The plan to shoot at the police station was Michael Kanaan's idea, but the accused was present and enthusiastic. Kanaan was offended that young Lebanese males were being targeted by the police and 'nobody' was doing anything about it. Charlie Derbas (the boss of the 'Telopea Street Boys'), an associate of DK's Boys, did not have the ""balls"" to do anything about it according to Kanaan and he wanted to make a 'statement' about the matter by an attack upon the local police station. 

50On 31 October 1998 Rossini was at a family wedding reception or engagement party with Mr Laycock when he received a phone call from Kanaan asking him to meet at Croydon Park at a 7-Eleven store. He said that he was rung about 10 or 11pm. He went with Laycock to Croydon Park and met up with Kanaan, the accused and others. When he arrived there he saw that the accused was at the driver's wheel of a white four-wheel-drive vehicle. 

51Rossini and Laycock parked beside Jamal's car and Rossini got out to speak to Kanaan and others through the driver's side window. There was a discussion in which the accused was present and Kanaan said that they needed to get some ""artillery"" for a drive-by shooting and had to go back to Surry Hills to get it. He said the accused and Kanaan were in the front seat, 'Easy', GeaGea and El-Assad in the back seat.

52Mr Rossini said that he had had a bit to drink and was slightly tipsy. At the committal in 2000 he said he had been heavily intoxicated having had '5-6 jugs of beer' at the family function. As this was to be a shooting it would be 'normal' to get stockings and gloves. This was the usual procedure. They discussed that they may have had gloves so all they had to do was get stockings. Laycock bought the stockings at the 7-Eleven store at Croydon Park on Rossini's instructions. 

53He and Laycock drove back to Surry Hills. When he got back to Surry Hills all the 'boys' were there. At the Surry Hill apartment there was a stockpile of approximately 5 to 10 weapons, including an assault rifle, shot gun and handguns. At the flat he saw Charlie GeaGea, Kanaan and 'Easy' with weapons. GeaGea already had a .45 pistol, that had been given to Rossini by Danny Karam and was Rossini's weapon of choice. Kanaan and Easy already had 9 mm pistols. He saw the accused sitting next to Easy. He drew a plan of the apartment and marked with people were sitting (Exhibit C). He arrived at the apartment late at night before midnight. The accused had a police scanner with an earpiece. He thought some plans had been made before Rossini arrived. 

54Michael Kanaan made arrangements to get a stolen car with Tony Haddad. Rossini had been involved in many shootings before and a new the"" drill"" as to what he was to do which was effectively to run interference for any police intervention, to be a ""bumper"" as he described it. Rossini left first with Laycock. Laycock picked up petrol from a petrol station on Canterbury Road. They went to a street near Tony Haddad's place at Wiley Park and there he saw ""Johnny"", Haddad's car thief, with a red stolen car. He said there was no discussion about what was to be done at that point as ""we"" had fulfilled our role to provide petrol and stockings. Rossini however wanted to help. He and Laycock went to behind the Wiley Park Public School in Denman Avenue, near the school gate. Ultimately he saw Michael, Wassim, Easy and Charlie GeaGea in the stolen car and the accused behind the driver's seat of the white four-wheel drive. 

55The accused told the others to drive the stolen car to behind the 'Buddhist Temple' (on King Georges Road, near Wiley Park Station) after the shooting and burn it there and then run to where his car was parked. 

56Rossini and Laycock drove to near Haldon Street and parked in Oneata Street, Lakemba. He said their car could be used as a 'bumper' vehicle to put off pursuing police. There he waited. He heard gunshots and then with Laycock drove back to Denman Street, Wiley Park, by driving along Croydon Street, left at The Boulevarde, across King Georges Road at Wiley Park, then around eventually to Denman Avenue behind the Public School. 

57When there he saw the accused's car. He saw the men running through the school, saw Michael Kanaan jump in the front seat and the others follow, then the two cars (Laycock's car and the accused's) drove off down to Canterbury Road, left into Canterbury Road and the lead car was ""followed"" to about Hurlstone Park, when he lost sight of that vehicle. Laycock's car provided by the gang some weeks before was a two seater 'MX6'.

58Back at the flat at Surry Hills he saw Michael Kanaan doing a re-enactment. He said: ""The cops will think twice about targeting Lebs"" and that ""Bankstown would be next"". Wassim El-Assad referred to the fact that he could see a ""cop"" ""shitting himself"" as he dropped to the ground. There was a conversation about shells being left. Michael and Wassim did most of the talking. The accused was present but did not say much. 

Mr Laycock

59In summary he confirms the family function at a club, then going to Croydon park 7-Eleven store driving Rossini. He was always driving as Rossini could not drive. He implicates the accused as being present at the 7-Eleven store at Croydon Park. He states that ""Hass"" (or ""Easy"") was in the accused's car with Kanaan and the accused and that it was a dark (or black) Land Cruiser. This was a car he had not seen before.

60He said that there was conversation about there being ""heat"" in the area between Michael and Rossini and ""they wanted to do something about it"". He can't remember everything that was said because he wasn't paying close attention. He was instructed to buy pantyhose. He bought pantyhose at the 7-Eleven store. He gave the pantyhose to Alan Rossini who was talking to the ""boys"" in the car. 

61He and Rossini then went to Surry Hills to pick up firearms. The others did not come to the apartment. He said that his cousin picked up three hand guns (a .45 and a 9mm pistol at least) that he (Alan) got from a wardrobe and that he put them down his pants. Then they went to a house in the Punchbowl area. This was Hass' or Easy's place. There he saw Michael Kanaan, Wassim and Hass, the accused, himself and Alan Rossini. He indicated that Hass may have been Easy. Hass let them into the lounge room and there was talk amongst the ""boys"". Kanaan, El-Assad and Hass had handguns. He says that a stolen car was organised from the house with Tony Haddad, which was the person who organised stolen cars for the group. There they discussed getting fuel to torch the car. He said there was a discussion about ""heat"" on the boys who did business in the area, he recalled some reference about the accused and Hass' business in this discussion and that they were going to get back at the police for harassment. He left with Alan Rossini and said he saw the Land Cruiser out the front. They went to a 7-Eleven in Canterbury Road bought a silver tin and filled it up petrol. This is confirmed by a series of photographs from CCTV footage.

62He said that he and Rossini went eventually to the back of Wiley Park School, and saw the Land Cruiser with the accused in it. The red Commodore that was stolen pulled up with El-Assad in the driver's seat, Kanaan in the passenger's seat and Hass in the back. He understood that the police station at Lakemba was to be fired upon by the boys in the red car. 

63He drove to Croydon Street Lakemba with Rossini. But as far as he was concerned there was no purpose in parking there other than the make sure they did what they said that they were going to do. He heard numerous shots and then he drove directly to Canterbury Road along Croydon Street. There he could see the police going to Lakemba in their motor vehicles. He and Rossini went back to Surry Hills. The others arrived there first. When he saw the others they are in the lounge room ""jumping for joy"" but he can't recall exactly what they said. He saw weapons on the coffee table. He said they never spoke about the matter again. 

Dennis Green

64Mr Green is relied upon by the Crown to support the account of Mr Rossini of the first meeting discussing the proposed shooting of which Rossini spoke. He was a ""runner"" then, and later a manager, for the group's cocaine distribution business. He was intimately involved in the drug supply enterprise. He said that one evening he travelled to the apartment in Surry Hills after El-Assad asked him to buy stockings. He bought four pairs of stockings. He was told by what El-Assad to get for dark pairs. 

65He was rung about 7-8 pm and arrived at the Surry Hills apartment shortly after from another safehouse in Oxford Street. He said he saw Michael Kanaan and others sitting around a table. He sat down next to Michael and ""Ray"" was opposite him. He said Ray had a ""silver gun"". They were cleaning guns at the time. He said Michael leaned over and whispered words to the effect: ""Lakemba Police Station"", and gestured to shoot. Green claims that he said to Michael ""You are a sick cunt"". He stayed no more than five minutes. He marked a plan, Exhibit H, showing the positions of people present.

66He was shown a colour photograph of the 'DKs Boys'. He could not identify Danny Karam from the photograph Exhibit B11. He could not identify Charlie Gea Gea. He was shown another photograph which included the accused as he was said to appear in about 1998/1999. He could not identify the accused from the photograph of the accused and other Karam associates in Exhibit B12. 

Roy Kennedy

67Mr Kennedy gave evidence of a conversation he claimed he heard involved in with the accused some time in 1999 in which the accused allegedly made admissions concerning his involvement in the Lakemba Police Station shooting. Mr Kennedy said that he was a drug supplier working for the accused from late January 1999 until early July 1999. He gave an induced statement to police on 5 July 1999 because he wanted to be free of the accused and his own involvement in the supply of marijuana. He had other reasons, which included the fact that he was aware, or believed, he was under surveillance and that he was in jeopardy of arrest and prosecution. He gave a statement to police detailing his involvement in drug supply and including in that statement details of conversations he had with the accused. 

68After he started working with the accused he was present when Mr Jamal was talking to other people at a car repair business in which Mr Jamal allegedly had a ""share"". These other people were Lebanese people that he, Mr Kennedy, did not know by name. He said that they were talking about the ""shooting up"" of the Lakemba Police Station, Jamal allegedly said, ""We done it to get them off our backs"". The timing of this conversation, he said, was ""about a month"" after Mr Kennedy had heard about the shooting. Mr Kennedy cannot precisely time the occurrence of the conversation by reference to ""summer or winter"". He saw the accused drive a number of cars including ""some type"" of Land Cruiser. He said that on later occasions the accused raised with Kennedy the ""Lakemba shooting"", which he took to be raised as a threat to him. 

Prosecution submissions

69The learned Crown Prosecutor accepted the need for appropriate warnings in relation to each of the civilian witnesses, each for different reasons. The Crown correctly and properly concedes that Mr Rossini in the period of and either side of the events giving rise to the current charge had been involved in a large number ""heinous crimes"", extremely violent offences and serious drug supply which reflect that the deal that he struck with the prosecuting authorities was ""extraordinarily"" good, or beneficial. It was submitted that he, however, was not trying to ""save his own skin"" in this matter and was not necessarily telling untruths given the circumstances in which he came forward to give evidence. 

70The Crown outlined the evidence about the character of the organisation, the participants in the activities of DK's Boys, the activities in which they were involved and indicated that the Court would accept that the accused had an association with members of the group, and was in fact a participant in the criminal activities of the group. Mr Rossini referred to the accused being at the apartment at Surry Hills a ""lot"", at least ""every two or three days"". There was no doubt, it was submitted, that the accused was involved in the group's affairs to a substantial extent.

71The Crown in its submissions summarised what it says was the relevant evidence in relation to matters about which Mr Rossini gave evidence that implicated the accused, such as the meeting approximately a week before the shooting, at which the accused was present, when Mr Kanaan explained why there was a need to make a ""statement"" at Lakemba, the evidence of Mr Rossini's contact with the group on the evening of 31 October, when he met with the accused, Mr Kanaan and others at the 7-Eleven at Croydon Park, conversations directed at planning the shooting in the presence of the accused, his evidence of the attendance at Surry Hills after Mr Laycock at his request purchased stockings at Croydon Park, the activities in the apartment when Michael Kanaan, Charlie GeaGea and Easy armed themselves with three handguns, experiments with socks to catch expelled cartridges, conversations about what was to happen and the accused's possession of a scanner. She pointed out that Rossini was circumspect about this criminal enterprise believing that Karam would not approve and that it would bring unwanted attention from the authorities. This reflection by him on the futility of the exercise enhanced his credibility. She referred to the agreement that Rossini would obtain petrol for the burning of the stolen car, the travel then to obtain the petrol, and meeting in Denman Street with those that Mr Rossini said when often the stolen car apparently to do the shooting. She summarised the witness' evidence about what he did and why he did it in parking nearby to Gillies Street Lakemba, the travel back to the flat. She noted the conversation occurring back at the flat confirmed Rossini's reliability, including words to the effect that one of the shooters saw police ""diving to the ground"", consistent with the police account of relevant events. The detail of his evidence showed his intimate involvement in the criminal enterprise and thus, his capacity to give a full account of the accused's involvement. 

72She submitted that Mr Rossini was a truthful witness. He did not embellish Mr Jamal's role and did not endeavoured to a tribute to Mr Jamal matters that he was not sure of, or exaggerate things that he said, giving examples of how he did not attempt to overstate the accused's role or 'gild the lily', so to speak. 

73She went through the detail of Rossini's other criminal activity, his reasons for giving statements to the police in 1999, as demonstrating his openness and full disclosure. She asked the Court to bear in mind that he was involved in a lengthy period of great lawlessness, various events might have run together in his mind and the length of time since relevant events could affect his memory, but there is no great change in his essential account. He had not refreshed his memory from transcripts of previous proceedings and inconsistencies with previous testimony were to be expected in the circumstances, but did not detract from his truthfulness and credibility. He was entirely frank about his criminality, it was submitted. 

74In relation to Mr Laycock she submitted that he had a different level of intellect than Mr Rossini and had a different focus at relevant times. He did not speak to Mr Rossini before he made his statement which firstly placated the prisoner and others. Evidence he gave in response to questions asked by the Court demonstrated that he was not focusing on any detail at particular times. He was more interested in following the instructions given to him by Mr Rossini. Essentially it was submitted that he supported Mr Rossini's account in critical respects, because he described the accused as being present at the discussions at the 7-Eleven store at Croydon Park, that he was driving a four-wheel-drive vehicle, and was present with people Mr Rossini implicated immediately before the shooting occurred. He was supported in his claim of involvement by the photographic evidence from the CCTV footage which showed him purchasing the metal can and petrol which was later used to destroy the stolen car. She noted that he did not place Mr Jamal as being so intimately bound up in the affairs of DK's Boys, as had Mr Rossini, but that simply reflected his different perspective of the workings of the group. She noted the frankness of his evidence about the drug supply network up until the time of Danny Karam's death, at which time he was not involved in directing people to do anything. His evidence was that the group was collecting as much as $26,000 a week from its drug distribution network. He confirmed evidence given by Mr Rossini regarding some of the modus operandi of the group such as use of stolen cars, only speaking about jobs done once and not again, burning cars after their use. There was no doubt that the group was for many months raking in thousands of dollars per week just from the sale of cocaine. Karam was ""skimming"" $4,000 a week, just for the 'franchise rights', or 'rent money' to run the operation. 

75The Crown summarised the circumstances of attending the 7-Eleven store, where he saw a different coloured four-wheel-drive vehicle than seen by Mr Rossini. He supported Mr Rossini in relation to the manner in which the cars were parked, the presence of the accused and Michael Kanaan in the front of the car as well, as the instruction to get pantyhose. 

76Laycock nominated Hass as being present, not Easy, but suggested this was because Hass and Easy were in fact the same person in his mind. She acknowledged that he gave a different account of the subsequent events, but these differences were not great. Importantly, she submitted he placed Mr Jamal with those that Mr Rossini had nominated as the principal people involved in the shooting. He gave a different account of what happened after the shooting and a different account of who he saw drive off in the stolen car do conduct the shooting, but consistent with Rossini he placed the accused in the "" get away car"" behind the school before the shooting occurred. 

77She pointed out that from the agreed facts can be seen that whilst the eye witnesses to the shooting give slightly different accounts, they are generally consistent with the accounts given by Rossini and Laycock of the number of participants. The ballistic evidence supports a number of different firearms being used, and the activities of the police dog, vis-a-vis the location of the burned-out stolen car and its relationship to Wiley Park Public School, were consistent with the ""shooters"" running from behind the ""Buddhist Temple"", across King Georges Road, through the school to where the pick up car was parked, as alleged by Rossini. 

78The Crown conceded that Mr Green was not a credible witness and had been untruthful in a material respect in relation to his possession of firearms. The Crown conceded that the event that he had admitted to in his statement, in which he had possessed a firearm and placed that in the mouth of another man to threaten him, would be something he would not forget, assuming that he was not a regular user of firearms for this purpose. The Crown submitted that Mr Green's account of his attendance upon the flat at Surrey Hills supported Mr Rossini. Particularly it was submitted, in relation to the first meeting, of which Mr Rossini gave evidence, concerning discussion to shoot at the Lakemba Police Station. She noted the similarity between plan marked by Mr Rossini as to people and their locations within the room (Exhibit C) and the plan Green marked as exhibit H. 

79With regard to Mr Kennedy the Crown submitted that his account of the conversation of which he gave evidence at the smash repair business in Greenacre was capable of being treated as an admission, if it was accepted that the words uttered by the accused were said, as were the subsequent references to the Lakemba Police Station. 

80The Crown conceded forensic disadvantage to the accused but correctly pointed out this works both ways in this case. On Rossini's account, with the meeting at the 7-Eleven store, the Riley Street apartment, the car behind the school and a subsequent events, there can be no doubt that the accused was part of a joint criminal enterprise to commit the primary crime. Mr Laycock supported Mr Rossini in material respects, in circumstances where by doing so he had ""put his cousin in"". Yet, he did not know Mr Jamal as well and had implicated himself. His reference to Hass rather than Easy could simply be a mistake. Mr Laycock and Mr Rossini were very consistent about the meeting at the 7-Eleven store in putting Mr Jamal in the front seat of the Land Cruiser during discussions with Mr Rossini and the purchase of petrol.

81It was submitted that the evidence of Mr Rossini about the planning had the ""ring of truth"". The evidence established an association of the relevant time between the accused and other people including Rossini who were involved. The accused had a motive to commit the crime. There was no evidence of any animosity between the accused and Mr Rossini and Mr Laycock. Differences in their accounts were explicable and had to be seen in the context of overarching consistency. It was open to the Court to conclude that they independently implicated the accused because he was involved, not because they were endeavouring to ""save their own skin"". 

Defence submissions

82It is unnecessary to survey the defence submissions in detail as I was not ultimately persuaded by the Crown submissions that the accused had been proven guilty by the prosecution and because the submissions of the defence were considerably truncated by questions asked by the Court to clarify aspects of the evidence adverted to by the prosecution. Learned counsel for the accused said that the prosecution case was such that it it was trying to put together a jigsaw puzzle where the pieces did not fit. It was submitted in general and specific terms that the warning to be given in relation to the civilian witnesses, particularly Mr Rossini and Mr Laycock, pursuant to s 165 Evidence Act 1995, meant that considerable caution and close scrutiny was required of their evidence before the Court to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused. The Court needed to be careful in its evaluation of the witnesses given the period of time since relevant events. None of the civilian witnesses gave evidence about cooperation for altruistic reasons, their motives for their cooperation were suspect.

83Specific submissions were put arising from the evidence of those four witnesses, particularly in relation to matters where it was clear the witnesses were demonstrably unreliable or untruthful. For example, the evidence of Mr Green, to which reference was made by the learned Crown Prosecutor in her closing submissions. He specifically attacked Mr Rossini's attempts to downplay his own criminality and his attempts to portray the accused has more involved in the affairs of DK's Boys than was the reality. The Court asked Mr Driels to clarify some of the evidence of Mr Kennedy and Mr Green and also requested counsel to particularise the specific evidence given by Mr Rossini and Mr Laycock about who was present at particular meetings on the evening of 31 October and early on the morning of 1 November 1998. Counsel was also asked to clarify from the evidence any confusion in the minds of Mr Laycock particularly, and Mr Rossini, as to who was present at particular times during the evening. He reminded the Court of the different descriptions of the vehicle Mr Jamal was driving and the differing accounts the witnesses gave of the course of events after the meeting at the 7-Eleven store at Croydon Park. He pointed to the conflict in the evidence about the purported motives of the shooting, from different sources, and the conflict in the evidence between the reasons given by Mr Laycock and Mr Rossini for parking in different streets nearby to the Lakemba Police Station. He also took the Court, in summary form, to inconsistencies in the evidence of Mr Laycock and Mr Rossini in this court concerning the events surrounding the shooting with evidence or statements previously given. He reminded the Court of the need to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt and submitted that this the Crown did not do in this case.

Consideration of evidence at the trial and submissions

84The prosecution case to implicate the accused is very much dependent upon Rossini and to a lesser extent Laycock. I say to a lesser extent in his case, because it was apparent from the detail of the evidence of the witness that, as he readily conceded, given that 14 years had passed since the relevant events thus affecting his memory, at the relevant time of these events he was paying little attention to the detail of what was going on around him, what others were doing and saying, or even the significance of a particular events, a matter emphasised by the prosecution. But not paying attention to the detail of what people were saying does not explain other differences about this movements and things done to prepare for the shooting and escape from the account of Rossini and the differences in describing who were the 'shooters'. 

85After their arrest they both struck an ""extraordinary bargain"". The bargain they struck meant that neither of them would spend any time in custody for the various crimes they committed. Of course, Rossini was more implicated than Laycock, as he was truly a ""partner"" in crime with Kanaan and the others, including the deceased Karam as I have earlier outlined.

86Although there was evidence given to flush out the extent of the criminality of both men, in respect of some matters there was considerable detail but other aspects of criminal activity were presented in an impressionistic away. Although both witnesses gave evidence about their past criminal behaviour in a 'matter of fact' fashion, this could not disguise the reality that both men to varying degrees were intimately connected with very serious criminal activity in which they participated willingly and cold heartedly. Mr Rossini was a man capable of considerable evil and went about it in a cerebral, considered fashion, or so he claimed. He was, and no doubt still is, cunning, resourceful, clever and calculating. He presented in that fashion. No doubt the fashioning of the arrangement with the authorities which permitted him to avoid the real possibility of a lifetime in prison reflects this, as does the account he gave of his criminal activities and the matter of fact way in which he involved himself in them to ingratiate himself with others. His attempts to portray himself as not really a violent man, who did bad things, in part because he had 'hung around with bad people', and largely acted violently to 'defend himself', was not only unconvincing but an example of his self justification for some of his actions. 

87Laycock was, of course, younger and was generally acting at the direction of the Rossini. But he, by the time he was arrested, had the authority and the initiative to have an important role in the drug distribution activities of the group and be directly dealing with the underlings in the drug distribution network. He too necessarily had the cunning and guile to fulfil the needs of Rossini and other members of the group and was prepared to involve himself in activities to assist the group, notwithstanding his knowledge of the terrible things for which the group, including his cousin, were responsible. The evidence he gave of the circumstances immediately after the shooting of Karam to cover-up what had occurred, so far as it implicated members of the group, is an illustration of that. 

88While I accept the witnesses have had to give evidence on a number of occasions about various events including the shooting incident with which I am concerned, and this may lead to a some confusion, loss of memory and the like, I also bear in mind that they are both practised witnesses who well know that they are literally 'singing' for their freedom and 'locked in' (in general terms) to whatever version they gave in the first instance, in so far as their accounts implicate particular people, though fine detail varies quite a bit. 

89As with most people knowingly concerned with the commission of crimes, they had intimate knowledge of the relevant details either from first-hand observation or from information provided to them from those that were intimately connected with the relevant crime. They could easily add to or subtract from their accounts in order to make themselves out as plausible, or attractive, or less culpable than they were in reality. This they both did in specific instances. Mr Rossini in his depiction of Jamal as one of DK's Boys, Mr Laycock in his failure to disclose, without prompting, his role as an enforcer for the gang. Both, advertently (in the case of Laycock) or inadvertently (in the case of Rossini), when they involved Mawas in the Lakemba shooting but he was overseas.

90Whilst Rossini readily admitted to involvement in serious crime, in critical respects he sought to distance himself from what can be called the extreme behaviour of people such as Kanaan, as earlier outlined. He came into this group as an outsider. He was not Lebanese, but was a friend of Kanaan who had to ""jump through the hoops"" to obtain the trust of Karam. Yet, on occasions that he attended upon scenes or places where he knew extreme violence was to be meted out and he was there to assist, to prove himself as part of this crime gang, he said he in effect, allowed others to take the lead. But he was a leader in a real sense. He could not have attained his position in the group without taking a leading in it s various activities. On his own account, he willingly stood by willing and was able to assist, if needs be, but did not do the most violent acts. He was known to the group as 'Charez'. Kanaan was known as 'Doc', as in Dr John 'Doc' Holliday (the associate of Wyatt Earp, involved in the, so-called, 'Gunfight at the OK Corral').  The nicknames apparently reflected their predilections or fantasies.  The name 'Chavez' was not fully explained.  His air of self justification in his account of some of his criminal activity arose again and again. In relation to the double murder at Five Dock he said occurred in circumstances where he claimed one of the deceased struck him whilst he was sitting in the car so he got out of the car to fight one of the men to defend himself. He did this in circumstances where he knew that some of his colleagues were armed. He was apparently immediately present when Kanaan shot dead at least one, if not two, of those involved in the fight. One wonders what he was defending himself from in the circumstances, or why he needed to' defend' himself? Perhaps he gives the term a liberal interpretation. Of course, the parties have not drawn my attention to the fact-finding in the sentencing exercise of those convicted of the murder of those men to enable me, at least by reference to that material, to make an assessment of the objective credibility Mr Rossini's account of his involvement. I am not suggesting, of course, that it can be concluded that Mr Rossini was involved in shooting anybody that night, or that there was some plan in which he participated to kill those that were murdered. However, his account was that on that night he and the others were on their way to find somebody in order to inflict serious punishment on that person, if that person could be found. There is no doubt that he was 'up' for violent conduct in company with armed people, assuming that he was not armed himself.

91The Crown submissions endeavoured to depict him as a frank witness. However, there were aspects of his evidence that reflected more his capacity for self justification and minimisation of his conduct. An example of this was his assertion that he did not regard himself as a ""violent"" person, but rather a person who did ""violent"" things. This was one aspect of his evidence that is reflected, even 15 years after the event, he has, and/or had, a very narrow moral compass and has a considerable air of self justification and discernment that permeated his evidence of his own criminal responsibility in relation to a range of his criminal activities. The expression ""confess and avoid"" comes to mind in respect of some of his evidence of past misdeeds.

92In summary Rossini and Laycock particularly have had a lot to lose by not living up to the various bargains that they entered into with the authorities. In relation to this particular offence there is nobody to contradict what they say other than those who were involved. In giving evidence they have had no regard for anything other than their own survival and their own self-interest. Of course, I do not know the machinations that led to their deliverance from years, perhaps decades, of penal servitude. They may have persuaded the investigators that they were ashamed of what they did, eager to reform, willing never to commit to crimes again, make a break from the past, be truthful and reliable in their evidence etc. However, it is quite clear at the time that they committed their criminal acts, they had no regrets, no remorse, no empathy and no regard for others. Not even for those to whom they were beholden to be involved in the criminal enterprises in in which they participated and in respect of which they both considerably profited. Rossini far more than Laycock. He permitted his mentor, Danny Karam, to walk off to his death by armed ambush with no regrets or qualms. Laycock was a willing lapdog to Rossini whose loyalty to him was paramount. 

93Mr Rossini's admissions, so far as they went, of his involvement in the murder of a Danny Karam were very chilling indeed. That Karam was a man who was a danger to the community and was an entirely unpleasant person, of that there can be no doubt. As I disclosed to the parties, he threatened to kill me in the presence of his solicitor when he got out of gaol in about 1991/1992 because he did not like the advice I had given him on a construction of the transitional provisions of the new repealed Sentencing Act 1989. But neither Mr Rossini or his criminal colleagues had the right to make the moral judgement that he deserved to die so that they could continue with their criminal enterprise, wreaking misery and violence upon those that crossed them or even supported them. They 'put him down', so to speak, because he was expendable, not because they were doing a 'community' service. They were the people 'out of control' at the time, not Karam. According to Rossini, Karam would not have approved of the shooting. His reaction was not the subject of evidence. Mr Rossini was a person disposed to violence, who had been taken under Karam's wing to receive an entree to wealth and a lifestyle that he could never achieve from legitimate exertions. He sought to portray Michael Kanaan as some sort of out of control psychopath, that he, Rossini, was trying to control by astute advice and suggestion. But he could not disguise the fact in a range of ways, and in many instances as an active participant, that he was prepared to go along with Kanaan's excesses. I have no doubt that Mr Rossini has at every available opportunity sought to downplay his own involvement in criminal activity, particularly serious violence, for his own advantage. 

94He was an equal in 'DK's Boys' with Michael Kanaan for an extended period of time leading up to Danny Karam's death. Yet, although he admits to 'bashing' people and being present when people were bashed in very violent ways he sought to lay the blame, or the major role, to others. He did not throw a runner off a balcony, that was Kanaan and his idea. Mr Green saw that differently. Although we admits to having a favourite firearm and being willing to arm himself, at every available opportunity, looking on two occasions to kill 'Tongan Sam' (an associate, it is said, of 'the Ibrahims') if he could be found, having jumped through all the hoops put up by Danny Karam, having established himself as a confidante of the 'out of control' Michael Kanaan, said he did not shoot or stab anybody. One wonders why he had a favourite firearm in these circumstances. He admitted being involved in the EP1 shooting and the Everleigh Street shooting, but not involved in any shooting where people were injured. Given his position in the organisation, his fondness for firearms, his violent disposition, the calculated way in which he went about enriching himself and others; this is very difficult to believe at face value. Those that could contradict him are dead, in gaol or aligned to him. Of course, this Court does not know the basis upon which the extraordinary decision was made to protect him for all time from the consequences of his very serious criminal conduct. It may have been the reality, or course, that if he had admitted to actually shooting somebody, or killing somebody, the authorities would have had to draw the line at offering him the indemnities and undertakings that he was ultimately given. It is for others to decide if the line was drawn too favourably for him and Laycock. Mr Green might have good reason to think so. Any expressed regret and remorse to police and other authorities could only be reasonably viewed as an ex post facto reconstruction on his part. He offered no evidence in this case that there was any regret or remorse when it would have been timely to express it, although this aspect was not the subject of particular enquiry. The evidence of Mr Laycock, not given by Mr Rossini, of Rossini reaching over the dead, but probably still warm, body of Mr Karam to take the money that Karam had on him at the time that he was executed, is testimony of a lack of timely regret or contrition and possibly more. 

95So far as Mr Rossini's claims of the accused's involvement in the cocaine supply business, noting that the accused has never been charged in relation to that activity and some conflicts in the evidence, they were, exaggerations on his part to falsely implicate the prisoner in the group's activities. Mr Green, who I will deal with the in greater detail later, made no mention of any connection of ""Ray"" with the cocaine supply business in which he was intimately involved as a runner and then a manager after Karam's death. Most importantly, Rossini gave a statement to police about his involvement in the cocaine supply business in 1999, under inducement, and apparently made no mention of the accused's involvement in that statement. Perhaps he had a poor memory at that time. 

Inconsistencies in the evidence and other matters regarding Rossini and Laycock

96The prosecution submits that despite the fact that there are differences in their accounts of the events before and after the police station shooting that these two witnesses with their significant inherent unreliability essentially support each other in implicating the accused. However insignificant respects they do not materially support one another in circumstances that reflect an underlying truth and accuracy in their accounts, either as to the motive for the shooting, the role of the accused, or contemporaneous statements which reflect relevant intention and knowledge on the part of the accused. 

97Apart from the fact that the three critical witnesses relied upon by the prosecution to place the accused at the scene give differing perspectives of relevant events, there were a number of inconsistencies between the account they gave in their evidence in chief and accounts they had given on other occasions. There are inconsistencies between each other and there are inconsistencies between different versions they have given on different occasions. This may be suggestive that the witnesses had not at any point ""put their heads together"", so to speak, at least on matters of fine detail. 

98However, there were conflicts in their evidence in relation to matters of detail that are of considerable importance. Those conflicts were not reconcilable in some respects. 

99Rossini and Laycock gave starkly different descriptions of the vehicle that the accused was alleged to have driven both before and after the shooting. Mr Rossini said it was ""white"", Mr Laycock said it was ""dark/black"", both as early as June/July 1999. 

100At the meeting at the 7-Eleven store Mr Rossini placed the accused, Kanaan, El-Assad, Charlie GeaGea (mistakenly Mawas) and Easy in the accused's white four-wheel-drive. Mr Laycock placed the accused, Kanaan (both admittedly in the same position as Rossini had them), Hass and El-Assad in the car. He interposed Easy for Hass at one point in the evidence. I note that he identified the person that Rossini had identified as Easy, as ""Hass"", when he looked at B 12, in the exhibits. It is to be fairly said that Mr Rossini's identification of people in photographs B11 and B12, may be more dependable given his intimate involvement in the group, and his presence in the photograph B11. But all those shown in the various photographs would have been well-known Laycock given his long-term association with the group. In any event, Charlie GeaGea, an intimate of the group on Mr Rossini's account, is not nominated by Mr Laycock as involved in the shooting at Lakemba and was not recognised from the photograph by him. Mr Laycock did distinguish between ""Hass"" and ""Easy"" as people. They were ,in fact, two separate associates of the group.. On one day in his evidence Mr Laycock put Hass there, the next day he put Easy. He agreed there was a difference between the two accounts.

101The next phase of the criminal enterprise, the return to the Surry Hills flat to get ""artillery"", is totally different in the testimony of Rossini and Laycock. Rossini saw the accused, Michael Kanaan, Easy, El-Assad, Charlie GeaGea and Laycock at the Surry Hills apartment. He gave a detailed account of firearms obtained, who obtained which firearm, the accused having a scanner and some conversations. Laycock did not see anyone back at the flat and said Rossini picked up the firearms and then carried them out of the property himself.

102Rossini said that they ultimately met up again at Wiley Park near Tony Haddad's place. Laycock said that they went either to Easy's parents place, or Hass' parents place, in Punchbowl. There, he saw Rabeeh Mawas, Michael Kanaan, the accused, Rossini and himself. Mawas was overseas. 

103Mr Rossini said that the occupants of the stolen red car, later burnt, to be driven to the shooting were Kanaan, El-Assad, Charlie GeaGea and Easy. Mr Laycock saw Michael Kanan, El-Assad and Hass in the car driving off. 

104Mr Rossini said that after the shooting he and Mr Laycock drove back to the pick up point where he had earlier handed over the petrol and he saw the ""shooters"" jumping to the accused car. Laycock said they drove down Croydon Street to Canterbury Road and went straight back to Surry Hills. They both so they met up with those that they respectively nominate were involved in the shooting (of which there are differences noted as above), including the accused. 

105Mr Laycock made no mention of ""Johnny"" being involved in his 1999 statement, but added him to his recollection in subsequent testimony. In his 2009 evidence he nominated the accused is being in the stolen motor vehicle occupied by the nominated shooters, though this may have been a slip the tongue.

106Mr Rossini, in evidence in this trial, said that when he went to the Croydon Park 7-Eleven store he was slightly affected by alcohol. At a previous proceeding, much closer in time to relevant events, he had said that he drunk a number of jugs of alcohol and was heavily intoxicated. Further, when he gave evidence in 2009, at the previous trial of the accused, he gave a different route for returning to the rear of Wiley Park School after the shooting than that given in this Court. In fact, the route described in the earlier trial was the direct opposite of the route he described in this trial, the ""square"" referred to in the submissions of counsel accused. He smoked some cannabis back at the flat before the shooting occurred. 

107He gave differing reasons for parking in the different positions that they marked on the map to await the shooting from that of Laycock. Having undertaken a view of the area, I have a much better appreciation of the relationship of different streets to one another, the distances apart of various events, particularly in relation to the location of the shooting, the street in which Mr Rossini parked, the street which Mr Laycock said he parked the motor vehicle, the location of the 'torching' of the stolen car and the alleged departure and/or pick up point the shooters, variously described in the evidence of Rossini and Laycock; than I could get from the map tendered. Mr Laycock understood, as the driver, that they parked nearby, to make sure that the shooting taken place. Mr Rossini's belief was that the car they where they were in could be used as a ""bumper"" vehicle to distract intercept pursuing police vehicles Mr Laycock, the driver, who was to do the ""bumping"" did not have this understanding. On neither version did they attempt to use the vehicle as a ""bumper"" vehicle. Having seen the relationship of Oneata Street to the Police Station, with no evidence of agreement as to the escape route to be taken by the shooters and noting that they had at least three ways of finding their way back to where the car was burnt, there was little or no point parking when Mr Rossini said they were. There was even less point in parking in Croydon Street, which was further away from the Police Station. Rossini said that the accused had suggested a place where the stolen car could be burnt, and it was, which may support his account. Nothing either person said they did after the shooting would have assisted the 'shooters' either to escape or dispose of the motor vehicle. Details of where the car was burnt could have been provided to him by the perpetrators. 

108Such is the conflict in their respective accounts of what occurred after the shooting, this Court could reasonably have doubt that they were even in the Lakemba area at the time of the shooting. Their differing accounts reflect more recollections of people more peripherally involved than they claim, or else they are cobbling together a version or versions from what they may have been told by others, or have just made up critical aspects of their respective accounts. That part of their recollection may be based upon representations made by people were directly involved does not necessarily make their versions true. Of course, their admissions of participation, limited to not being the 'shooters', have always been protected at every step along the way, by induced statements and undertakings that evidence they give, on certain conditions, will not be used against them. That they agree to be truthful and are required be truthful is little guarantee of truthfulness, when there is no independent evidence to verify almost all aspects of their account. Photographs Mr Laycock buying a petrol can, and presumably petrol, some time before the shooting in the area of the shooting, does not verify their presence at earlier meetings, subsequent meetings or being in the Lakemba area at the time of the shooting. It is not unreasonable to conclude, not that this matters at all in the outcome, that they fully understood at all relevant times the more they placed themselves at relevant events more valuable they would be to the investigating authorities, particularly when much of the detail could not be independently verified from sources other than themselves. It is not without significance that, so far as the extent to which their accounts support each other, there are similarities, but there are significant differences. Some matters of difference may be explained by the absence from particular aspects of the execution of the crime. For example, if it is true they went back to Surry Hills before the shooting and were by the themselves there, then Mr Rossini could not have seen the accused with a scanner and earpiece on that occasion. 

109Although evidence has been led by the prosecution that Rossini and Laycock had not discussed the matter before they gave their initial statements, I would not accept them in this regard on face value. Nor could any number of claims of isolation from one another overcome the possibility that in agreeing to rollover for massive personal benefit, Rossini having followed Laycock, that the two men had reached some general agreement to ensure that they implicated as many people as possible in the matters for which they had direct knowledge. But doubts, if any and if reasonable, about their lack of collusion, are not central to not accepting them as witnesses of truth, or not accepting them as accurate or reliable. 

110In order to claim direct knowledge of the various matters about which they gave evidence, both relevant to the charge that I am concerned with and also relevant to their surrounding criminal activity, they could have been present at relevant times or they could have relied upon what they were told by others. Certainly, so far as Rossini was intimately involved in the activities of the criminal group and was clearly a leader of the criminal group, it is highly likely that he was relevantly present at material times or was fully informed by others. However, one need only go back to the earlier warnings which must be taken into account about the advantage of such a person has to fabricate key pieces of information and give them a veneer of respectability, to understand the basis for approaching the witnesses' evidence with considerable caution, particularly when one also takes into account the enormous, indeed extraordinary advantage, or advantages, that the particular witness received for his cooperation. 

111The evidence from Laycock relied upon to support Rossini, supports him in that it places the accused at places and performing tasks consistent with participation in what was on any view a joint criminal enterprise involving a number of people. But of that evidence required to give Rossini's evidence strength and reliability, and coherency, it is absent, because it places different people at different places than asserted by Rossini and does not support (nor contradict) Rossini's account of the ""first meeting"". 

The assessment of Dennis Green's evidence

112Dennis Green received a discount on the otherwise appropriate sentence for his involvement in a conspiracy to supply not less than a commercial quantity of cocaine of 50% for his cooperation and early plea of guilty. He was sentenced ultimately to 4 ½ years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 ½ years. He was released on parole on the expiry of his non-parole period. His undertaking to give evidence related to a number of matters including the various murders for which Mr Kanaan was convicted, a number of public shootings, including the discharge of firearms in the vicinity of the Lakemba Police Station, and a conspiracy to supply a large commercial quantity of cocaine. He was charged in relation to a conspiracy that existed between 1 January 1999 and 1 June 1999. The quantity of cocaine supply was between 420 and 630g over a period between 16 April 1999 and 1 June 1999. It was clear that these facts related to what could be established from telephone intercept material, rather than admissions made by the witness. On his own version of his involvement in the drug activities of DK Boys, he was involved in a conspiracy to supply cocaine over a much longer period in much greater quantities than those upon which he was sentenced. Of course, one has to have regard to the reality that many of his admissions were in an induced statement which could not be used against him. 

113As was conceded by the learned Crown Prosecutor in submissions, he was demonstrated in the course of his evidence here as having not given accurate or truthful evidence to this Court and was otherwise unimpressive. He denied, for example, ever having it in his possession a firearm for his work with DK's Boys. He claimed no memory of using violence to enforce the will of those who ran the criminal group. In the statement he gave in 1999 he gave an account of being present when Mr Laycock punched a man called 'Little Pauly' three or four times to the head causing him to bleed from the mouth before he took out a firearm (a pistol) pulled back the ""top"" and put the gun in the mouth of the runner while he was bleeding from the mouth. He initially read the statement at the relevant part and said he could ""vaguely"" remember the incident. When pressed he then remembered clearly that the firearm was a .45 ""Chinese"" brand automatic pistol and that he had a firearm in his possession over a period of six months when required. As the learned Crown Prosecutor said, it is difficult to understand how he could not remember this incident initially when pressed about it, when he had the opportunity of reading the statement that disclosed this before giving evidence and refreshing his memory of relevant events. One wonders how one could forget putting a .45 calibre pistol, with an engaged chamber, in the bleeding mouth of a person who he had seen beaten up. He had forgotten that he had said to the victim ""You fuck around next time you get it"" and had forgotten Laycock saying ""See boys, if you are good, nothing will happen to you"". Although, in fairness, he had disclosed these events in his induced statement.

114The firearm had been given to him as a ""present"" by Alan Rossini. Alan Rossini also gave him a bullet-proof vest. As I have earlier stated, I must make some allowance for the fact that witnesses are endeavouring to remember events that occurred over 14 years ago in some instances. Further, witnesses have given evidence about this matter on a number of occasions. But making due allowance for some vagueness in the evidence or the inconsistencies between evidence in this trial and other trials or previous statements, I cannot ignore the relevance of lack of memory, and/or inconsistencies, to assessing the truthfulness, accuracy and/or general credibility of the witness in question. 

115Mr Green similarly had difficulty remembering particular acts of violence committed in his presence. One such act was the bashing of a man in a unit or apartment and the throwing of him over the balcony of the apartment to the ground below. Perhaps this was a common occurrence in Mr Green's experience whilst he was involved with the 'DK's Boys'. When he was reminded of this matter he indicated that a number of people including Michael Kanaan and Alan Rossini participated in both the bashing and the throwing of the victim over the balcony. Mr Rossini gave evidence of this event and was very particular about the fact, as he claimed, that the throwing of the victim was Michael Kanaan's idea, not his and he did not physically participate in this event. Of course, Mr Green's vagueness of memory, or lack of credibility, might not be a proper foundation for doubting the forthrightness of Mr Rossini. But the conflict in relation to this incident remains. If Mr Green was truthful about the matter it shows Mr Rossini's lack of truthfulness and/or his attempts to down play his own involvement in heinous acts. 

116Mr Green presented himself as a servant of Rossini and others, primarily concerned with the drug distribution business in which they are all involved. But it was revealing, so far as his moral standards were concerned as that they may reflect upon his credibility in a general sense, that when he worked for the group he saw his loyalties as being to Rossini and Michael Kanaan, and not to the runners with whom he worked regularly. He admitted that he was aware that the 'bosses' of 'DK's Boys' were men capable of great violence. He knew that if he revealed the failings of his runners they could, or would, suffer serious injury. Yet he still 'dobbed' them in. Some did suffer injury based upon information he provided to his superiors. At the time, he had no regret about that. 

117Mr Green's account of purportedly relevant events as I have earlier indicated quite at odds in material respects with the accounts of either Mr Rossini or Mr Laycock. The meeting, if it occurred on 31 October 1998, occurred much earlier in the day than it could have occurred on the versions of Laycock and Rossini. They were at a family gathering at Croydon Park at the time. He claimed possession by Mr Jamal of a firearm that neither Rossini or Laycock saw at any relevant time. If Mr Green's version is true, then in critical respects the versions of Rossini and/or Laycock cannot be true, or accurate. Of course, Mr Green, at least in his first statement, placed this meeting in the Surry Hills flat the day before he saw a media report on television about the Lakemba Police Station shooting. His evidence of the ""timing"" of the meeting was not as accurate. It may be that he is giving evidence of another event, at an earlier time, where there was a group of people together preparing for the shooting at the Lakemba police station. The Crown submitted that his account supported Mr Rossini's account of the first meeting where the shooting of the police station was first discussed. Mr Rossini does not speak of Mr Green being present or of the accused handling a gun on that occasion. 

118There are other reasons to not only be cautious about Mr Green's evidence, but to regard him as a witness of little or no credibility. One such example is to be found in a comparison of the plan he marked in this trial, asserting his memory of where people were sitting when he came into the room of the apartment at Surrey Hills on the occasion Michael Kanaan whispered to him something about shooting at the Lakemba Police Station and the plan he marked at an earlier trial. Notwithstanding the passage of 14 years and the absence of any memory of acts of violence and related matters in which he was on his own admission personally involved, he placed the accused opposite him as he sat at the table at the time that Michael Kanaan spoke to him. However, in a plan drawn by him at the trial of others in relation to the Lakemba Police Station affair on 12 May 2005 he put the accused in a different position. He marked ""Easy"" in a different position on that occasion rather than in this trial. The Crown said that the plan marked in this trial was similar to Rossini's. One of the problems with accepting Mr Green's account as supporting Mr Rossini, even allowing for the similarity of the markings of the positions of people on the respective plans, is that Mr Rossini made no mention of Mr Green being present. He made no mention during that meeting of the accused having a firearm, or even a concrete plan to shoot up the Lakemba Police Station with particular firearms produced for the purpose. Mr Green's version of events suggested that Michael Kanaan's whispered comments indicated that the plan was in place and that is what they were preparing for at that time. As for whether the meeting occurred the 'night' before the media reports of it, as he asserted in his first statement to police in 1999, this does not accord with Mr Rossini's or Mr Laycock's versions in a number of material respects. Mr Laycock bought the stockings, not Mr Green. There was no such meeting on Laycock's account. Mr Green arrived at the flat sometime shortly after ""7 - 8p.m"", not closer to midnight, which is Mr Rossini's account of the meeting at Surry Hills before the shooting. Mr Rossini did not mention Mr Green being present at the meeting the night before, or of, the relevant shooting. At neither meeting did Mr Rossini assert in his presence he saw the accused armed that the firearm or handling a firearm. Given the importance of Mr Rossini's account in proving the guilt of the accused, Mr Green's version either contradicts it, or does not support it in material ways. 

119Mr Green's version of events has all the hallmarks of telescoping, or mixing, events into the narrative he wishes to give about his knowledge of the shooting of Lakemba Police Station, which he knew, or believed, had been conducted by his associates, or bosses. If he bought stockings, it must have been for a criminal enterprise that Mr Rossini did not tell the Court about. Or else he is simply transposing, or making up, events unrelated to the Lakemba Police Station shooting, but adding in detail, such as inventing the claimed remark made to him by Michael Kanaan. 

The assessment of Mr Kennedy's evidence

120The Crown opened and closed its case with a submission that that the accused's connection with the President Smash Repairs was a motive for being involved in the Lakemba Police Station shooting because the police had been investigating the business in October, before the shooting had occurred expressed in Mr Kennedy's evidence of the accused's admissions. This claimed motive has no tangible connection with the claim of Rossini as to the reasons for the planned shooting as was offered by Kanaan on the first occasion it was mentioned a week or so before the evening of 31 October. There is no evidence, for example, that the accused's business was connected to Tony Haddad's business. The claim by Mr Kennedy that the accused said later ""We did that to get the coppers off our backs"", is not in accordance with the sense of grievance at what was claimed to be all treatment by Lebanese people by police in the Lakemba area. Greenacre is some distance from Lakemba Police Station. Why ""shoot up"" the Lakemba Police Station over an operation conducted in respect of a smash repair business in Greenacre? One might have thought Bankstown Police Station was closer and had more connection with the raids on the smash repair business. If at all. Who would know which, if any, particular police station was involved in that operation? 

121There are other aspects of Mr Kennedy's evidence that invite circumspection when approaching it. He clearly did not give a statement to police for altruistic reasons. He suggested, although not in these words, that he was told by police that if he gave information to them he would be assisted in some way. He cannot be expected to remember precisely what was said to him although he was not pressed on this matter. It was clear that whatever information he was giving to police was intended by him to implicate the accused in his self admitted criminal conduct. He was keen to volunteer information in response to questions that were put to him by police, in relation to the accused. I am not suggesting that words were put in his mouth, or that he was improperly led, or anything of the sort. I have no evidence of that. But he was clearly anxious in July 1999 to volunteer information and he was particularly anxious to untie himself from the accused. For that purpose was prepared to put the accused in as bad a position or light as he was capable. 

122The claimed timing of the first admission by the accused, does not accord very well with the commencement of his association with the accused and the date of the shooting of the Lakemba Police Station. He said he started working for the accused in late January 1999. This was almost 3 months after the shooting incident, not a ""month or so"". He cannot precisely time the alleged admission though. One would need to be satisfied that what the accused said was exactly, or very close to, the detail provided in the evidence of the witness. I appreciate that his evidence in this regard was consistent in chief and in cross examination. But he had refreshed his memory from a statement made in early July 1999. If he refreshed his memory from the statement, assuming that 14 years after the event he could not be able to remember the words said with any precision, his recollection in that statement, given up to five or six months after the event, would still have difficulty recounting what was said with precision. It is to be remembered also that Mr Kennedy was himself a reasonably regular cannabis user at the time. 

123Even if I could be satisfied that he is completely accurate in his recollection of what he claims the accused said, I could not be satisfied that it was a relevant admission. The statement made had the hallmarks of a boastful remark, offering up a motive or explanation, which was not one given by those who heard relevant discussions contemporaneous with the events asserts was expressed. As the witness conceded, later references to the Lakemba Police Station shooting were made allegedly by the accused in the context of him saying to the witness words to the effect, ""that shows what I am capable of"", he took as a threat. The other factor arising from Mr Kennedy's evidence that makes it unpersuasive is that what he remembers of the alleged admission was a very general claim of responsibility. There is nothing in the admission that reflects information that could only have been known to someone who participated in the crime and could not be possibly known by the listener. In any event, although it is a minor matter given the general 'chain' of responsibility, the accused was not one of the ""shooters"". So, in one sense, but not a legal sense, the claim attributed to the accused was in some respects objectively boastful. 

124The claimed admission of the accused was not recorded. He first recounted it at least some months after the event. It is not independently verified or supported. In its terms it was later used and interpreted as a threat for the witness to behave himself. I cannot be satisfied, even on balance, that the accused made the statements attributed to him by the witness. It does not give credible support to accounts from other witnesses which themselves have significant credibility/accuracy problems of their own. 

Other inconsistencies

125In respect of the witnesses Rossini and Laycock, and to a lesser extent Green, there was a considerable amount of cross examination upon claimed inconsistencies with previous evidence in relation to the subject matter of this trial and also evidence given by the witnesses in other trials. Similarly, there were claimed inconsistencies with statements made to investigating police in relation to this matter and other matters for which the witnesses had received protection by induced statements and/or indemnity and undertakings not to be prosecuted. I do not propose to dwell upon these matters. Insofar as there were established inconsistencies with evidence or statements provided on prior occasions with evidence given in this trial on the same subject matter, in fairness to the witnesses, many of those matters were collateral to, or certainly not central to, the purpose of this trial and particularly the events directly concerned with the Lakemba shooting incident. In relation to other criminal activity and events connected to the activities of DK's Boys, while there were particular inconsistencies established, many of them were more connected to, or caused by, the passage of time since the relevant events and previous statements and testimony without the witnesses having an opportunity to refresh their memory from statements given in relation to matters other than directly concerned with the Lakemba affair. I accept that the witnesses have not had an opportunity to read evidence given previously in any of the Lakemba trials, or and other trials for which they have been called to give evidence concerning crimes committed by claimed members and associates of DK's Boys or themselves. They did not refresh their memories from 1999/2000 statements relating to other criminal activity, as far as I am aware. Analysis of many of these other inconsistencies is unnecessary given that, in the context of the warnings required to be taken into account in assessing the witnesses and the circumstances in which the witnesses come forward to give evidence, the Crown case fails to establish guilt on an analysis of the inconsistencies established between the different witnesses concerning the central factual issues. Then there is the inherent unreliability of the witnesses, the matters that demonstrate that the witnesses have been untruthful or loose with the truth and/or inaccurate in their account of other events, including their own criminal activities on other occasions, or for other reasons arising from the evidence set out in the judgement. 

Conclusion

126I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prosecution has proven that the accused was present at discussions to plan the shooting at, or near, Lakemba Police Station, or that he was present before and/or after the shooting to assist or support the shooters to commit the principal crime. I am not satisfied relevantly that he made admissions that were truthful that he had participated in, or was otherwise responsible for, the events of 1 November 1998 at Lakemba which are the subject of the charge for which he has been tried. Thus, I returned a verdict of ""not guilty"" to the count upon which he was arraigned.

2707054,"SKAF, Mohammed - Application under Part 7 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2013] NSWSC 181","Judgment
Introduction
1Pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (the ""Review Act""), Mr Mohammed Skaf seeks an inquiry into his convictions for offences he was found to have committed on 30 August 2000. He submits that the matter should be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal, pursuant to s 79(1)(b) of the Review Act, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
2Mohammed Skaf was tried for those offences along with his brother Bilal Skaf and two others. Bilal Skaf was also convicted. He has also made an application under s 78 of the Review Act which was also referred to me. At the time of the publication of this decision I am also publishing my decision refusing Bilal Skaf's application (Application of Bilal Skaf [2013] NSWSC 45 (the ""Bilal Skaf Application""). This decision should be read together with that decision. I use the same terminology in this decision as in that decision.
3Three matters are put forward by Mohammed Skaf in support of his application. First he contends that the reliability of the evidence of the complainant in his trial  (Miss C) was compromised given her disclosure that her recollection was based on ""dreams"" and ""flashbacks"" that she stated that she had some weeks after she was sexually assaulted. Second, he contends that the reliability of Miss C's identification of him from a photoboard on 26 September 2000 was compromised for the same reason. I reject both of these contentions for the same reasons I rejected  Bilal Skaf's application, namely that the relevant part of the Miss C's evidence was strongly corroborated by other independent evidence and they otherwise involve an unsafe assumption that her recollection was exclusively derived from her ""dreams"" and ""nightmares"".
4Third, Mohammed Skaf contends that there was a  failure by the Crown to disclose to the defence prior to the 2002 trial that fingerprint evidence had been taken from the Marion Street carpark toilets. I have considered this complaint on the basis that the Crown obtained this evidence and should have but did not disclose it to the defence prior to its existence being revealed during the course of the 2002 trial. This does not, however, cause me to have a sense of unease or disquiet concerning Mohammed Skaf's guilt. Whatever the outcome of the analysis it could not have affected the jury's deliberations.
5Accordingly the application is refused. 
Convictions and Sentences
6An overview of the course of the trial and the appeals is set out in the Bilal Skaf Application at [9] to [16]. Mohammed Skaf was arrested and charged on 7 October 2000. He faced 4 counts on a 17 count indictment presented at the 2002 trial, namely:Count 1 of detain Miss C for sexual advantage (R v Chami, M. Skaf, Ghanem and B. Skaf [2004] NSWCCA 36, the ""2004 Conviction Appeal"" at [12]);Count 2 of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent (2004 Conviction Appeal at [14]);Count 14 of detain Miss C for sexual advantage (2004 Conviction Appeal at [41]);  andCount 15 of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent (2004 Conviction Appeal at [42]).
7Mohammed Skaf was found guilty on all four counts. He was subsequently sentenced by the trial judge, Finnane DCJ, to lengthy terms of imprisonment for these offences and an offence he was said to have committed on 12 August 2000 (the ""12 August 2000 offence""). In April 2004 his appeal against his convictions on the offences committed on 30 August 2000 was dismissed (""2004 Conviction Appeal"") but his appeal against his conviction for the 12 August 2000 offence was upheld and a new trial was ordered (R v Bilal Skaf; R v Mohammed Skaf [2004] NSWCCA 37; 60 NSWLR 86). This resulted in a readjustment of the commencing dates for his sentences for the offences he was found to have committed on 30 August 2000. 
8In 2005 the Court of Criminal Appeal upheld an appeal against the sentences imposed for the offences committed on 30 August 2000 and re-sentenced him (R v Mohammed Skaf [2005] NSWCCA 298).  The effect of the sentences imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal for the offences committed on 30 August 2000 was an overall sentence of nearly nineteen years commencing on 3 January 2001 and expiring on 31 December 2019 with a minimum term of eleven years commencing on 3 January 2001 and expiring on 2 January 2012.
9In April 2006 Mohammed Skaf was retried on the 12 August 2000 offence and found guilty (R v Bilal Skaf; R v Mohammed Skaf [2006] NSWSC 394 at [1]). He was sentenced by Mathews AJ to a further term of imprisonment cumulative upon the sentences for the offences committed on 30 August 2000 (R v Bilal Skaf; R v Mohammed Skaf [2006] NSWSC 394 at [49]). His appeal against the sentence imposed by Matthews AJ in respect of the 12 August 2000 offence was successful  and he was re-sentenced for that offence (Bilal Skaf v R; Mohammed Skaf v R [2008] NSWSC 303). 
10The combined result of Mohammed Skaf's sentences is that the last one will expire on 1 January 2024 and he will be first eligible for release on parole on 1 January 2018 (Bilal Skaf v R; Mohammed Skaf v R [2008] NSWSC 303 at [113]).
The Crown Case against Mohammed Skaf
11In Bilal Skaf's application at [25] I extracted the description of the Crown case set out in the 2004 Conviction Appeal in so far as it was based on the evidence given by Miss C at the 2002 trial. It was the Crown case that Mohammed Skaf was the ""male in the yellow jumper"".  Counts 1 and 2 against Mohammed Skaf concern events in the toilet block at the Marion Street carpark (2004 Conviction Appeal at [12] and [14]) and counts 14 and 15 concern events at the ""industrial estate"" (2004 Conviction Appeal at [41] to [42]). This was subsequently identified by Miss C as an industrial estate in Chullora (Bilal Skaf Application at [38]). 
12Mohammed Skaf did not give evidence at the 2002 trial. The Court of Criminal Appeal described his defence as involving an assertion that he had consensual intercourse with Miss C in the Marion Street carpark toilets and a denial that he was the ""male in the yellow jumper"" who sexually assaulted her at the industrial estate (2004 Conviction Appeal at [55]).
13I have described the evidence surrounding the provision of Miss C's first and second statements on 1 September 2000 and 21 September 2000 respectively and the differences between them in the Bilal Skaf application at [36] to [45]. In light of that it is necessary to outline the course of the investigation and the material relied on by the Crown in its case against Mohammed Skaf in addition to the evidence of Miss C.
14On 26 September 2000 Miss C identified Mohammed Skaf from a photoboard as the ""man in the yellow jumper"" (2004 Conviction Appeal at [62]). This was after she had provided the second statement. (In support of this application Mohammed Skaf refers to an occasion on 2 September 2000 when Miss C failed to identify him from a photoboard. I address this below.)
15On 8 October 2000 the police searched the home of Bilal and Mohammed Skaf. They located a yellow long sleeved jumper with a ""Champion"" logo at the bottom of the wardrobe in their bedroom (2004 Conviction Appeal at [64]).
16Mohammed Skaf was interviewed on four occasions, twice in the early hours of 2 September 2000, once on 7 October 2000 and again on 13 November 2000. In the first and third interviews he denied, inter alia, being the male in the yellow jumper and having any knowledge of Miss C (2004 Conviction Appeal at [68] to [70]). He maintained that on 30 August 2000 he had attended a go-cart racetrack in Canberra (which was later shown not to have been open to the public on that day), and claimed to have stayed at a particular motel in Canberra (that police inquiries revealed did not exist). In the second interview he stated that he did not wish to participate in a line up.
17In his fourth interview Mohammed Skaf admitted that he had lied about travelling to Canberra on 30 August 2000. He admitted that he was the male person in a yellow jumper depicted in video footage from Bankstown railway station. He claimed that he had consensual sex with Miss C in the toilet block near the Marion Street carpark. He claimed that after he had finished and left the block, another male travelling with him went inside and that after that he and that male left and caught a bus. He denied having anything further to do with Miss C. He denied that he used or took her phone. He stated that she gave him her number which he saved (2004 Conviction Appeal at [71]). 
18The Court of Criminal Appeal identified a number of pieces of evidence confirmatory of Miss C's evidence in so far as they implicated Mohammed Skaf (2004 Conviction Appeal at [102] to [117]). They are to be considered bearing in mind his admission in his fourth interview that he lied in the first and third interviews and his concession that he was present at the toilet block near the Marion Street carpark wearing a yellow jumper and had sex with Miss C.
19First, there was the evidence of Miss C's friend (""Leah"") referred to in the 2004 Conviction Appeal at [8] to [9]. Miss C stated that at Bankstown police station she texted Leah and asked her to phone back and that she (Miss C) told Leah about her concerns. Miss C said that the ""male in the yellow jumper"" took the phone from her. Leah confirmed the evidence about the disguised phone call and the complainant's nervous or panicky state. She stated that she was told by the male speaker who grabbed the telephone ""[l]isten bitch, your sister will be home in ten to twenty minutes"". Leah said that she rang back and the telephone was switched off  (2004 Conviction Appeal at [8] to [9]). This evidence was said by the Crown to strongly support its case that sexual intercourse at the toilet block was not consensual.
20Second, the Crown relied on a consciousness of guilt on Mohammed Skaf's part by reason of the lies he told in his first and third interview and his putting forward a false alibi (2004 Conviction Appeal at [102]). 
21Third, there was a significant body of evidence corroborative of Miss C's testimony concerning the use of Mohammed Skaf's mobile phone and Miss C's mobile phone with Mohammed Skaf's SIM card. 
22Miss C claimed that the male in the yellow jumper took her telephone from her shortly after their arrival at Bankstown train station (2004 Conviction Appeal at [8]). She said that soon after she entered the black car after being assaulted at the toilet block she saw ""H"" leave that car and retrieve her SIM card from Mohammed Skaf (2004 Conviction Appeal at [20] and [111].  Later while she was being transported (and assaulted) in the red car she said that she saw a black car arrive with three occupants along with the male in the yellow jumper and she heard her phone ring as it had a distinctive ring tone (2004 Conviction Appeal at [39]). She said that after she was sexually assaulted at the industrial estate she was told to get in the black car (2004 Conviction Appeal at [45]). The male in the yellow jumper came up to the driver's side of the window and passed her telephone to one of the males in the car who had assaulted her. That male handed Miss C her telephone, told her to place the SIM card inside and demanded her telephone number. He rang her phone (2004 Conviction Appeal at [45]).
23Mohammed Skaf's telephone was found to contain Miss C's number under the name ""Amanda"" which was the name she gave on the train (2004 Conviction Appeal at [45]). The evidence from various witnesses employed by Vodafone concerning Mohammed Skaf's calls was particularly telling. It was described in the Crown case statement and extracted in the 2004 Conviction Appeal at [117] as follows:
""In  respect of 0415 681 064 (the mobile of Mohammed Skaf)
·  Calls were made from within the 21163 sector at 7:23pm (to Vodafone), 7:24pm and 7:44pm (to Bilal Skaf on 0414 076 468) and at 8:28pm (to Ali Skaf on 0415 889 122).
·  Calls were made from within the 21168 sector at 8:34pm (to Bilal Skaf on 0414 076 468), at 8:39pm and 8:40pm (to Vodafone) and at 9:03pm (to ""H"" on 0404 227 642).
· Calls were made from within the 21163 sector at 10:04pm (to Ali Skaf on 0415 889 122), 11:06pm (to 0404 155 188) and at 11:11pm (to Tayyab Sheikh on 0415 681 052).
The evidence of Justin Stark was that there had been a change in the IMEI identification number for Mohammed Skaf's SIM card from 7:23pm to 9:03pm on 30 August 2000 (exhibit C31). The IMEI number during this time (and only in this period) matched the number of the complainant's mobile phone handset. This indicated that the SIM card from Mohammed Skaf's mobile phone was placed into the complainant's mobile phone handset for that period of time. Afterwards the IMEI number reverted to Mohammed Skaf's mobile phone handset.
The Crown relied on this evidence to show that Mohammed Skaf had not left after the incident in the toilet block in the Marion Street carpark, as he had claimed to police in his final interview on 13 November 2000."" Sector 21168 served calls made to or from the Chullora industrial complex.  Sector 21163 served calls made to or from an area that included Valentia Street, which was the location of the home of Bilal and Mohammed Skaf (2004 Conviction Appeal at [115] to [116]).
24This material strongly confirms the account of Miss C as to what occurred in relation to the removal of her mobile phone and the SIM card and their staggered return to her during the night. It is also completely consistent with her evidence as to the ongoing role of the male in the yellow jumper after he sexually assaulted her in the toilet at the Marion Street carpark. It is inconsistent with Mohammed Skaf's assertion in his fourth interview that he had nothing further to do with Miss C after he left that location. It also points strongly to the presence of Mohammed Skaf at the Chullora industrial complex that night. 
25In the Bilal Skaf Application at [36] to [41] I described some of the changes in the sequence of events as well as to the identity and number of offenders between the first and second statements. In both statements Miss C described an offender who was wearing a yellow jumper.  However in the first statement this offender's involvement ceased after she was sexually assaulted in the toilet at the Marion Street carpark.  In the second statement (and her evidence) Miss C stated that this offender sexually assaulted her at the industrial estate.
26In the first statement Miss C stated that the male in the yellow jumper took her phone from her while she was on the train. She did not state when she retrieved it although it appears to be sometime just prior to being dropped at Lidcombe train station when the ordeal was almost over.  Miss C's first statement does not refer to the return to her of her SIM card without the phone, the use of her phone with another SIM card or her providing her telephone number. However, in her second statement Miss C described receiving her SIM card without the phone and providing her telephone number. These matters were repeated by her in her evidence at the 2002 trial. In addition in her evidence she recounted hearing her phone being used after her SIM card had been returned to her. As I have stated that evidence was supported by the evidence from the Vodafone employees. 
27Thus, in a number of important respects, the independent evidence adduced at the 2002 trial strongly confirmed a number of events that were recounted in Miss C's second statement that were not contained in her first statement. The evidence of Mohammed Skaf's mobile phone usage powerfully supports her evidence as to the retrieval of the SIM card and his use of her phone with his SIM card. More broadly it strongly demonstrates his ongoing involvement in the assaults committed upon her. The mobile phone records also point to Mohammed Skaf's presence at the Chullora industrial estate. It was only in the second statement that Miss C stated that she was sexually assaulted at an industrial estate. 
First basis for the application: Miss C's dreams
28I set out the relevant provisions of the Review Act and some of the principles governing their application in the Bilal Skaf Application at [17] to [24].
29The first basis for Mohammed Skaf's application is that the reliability of Miss C's evidence  was ""severely compromised by a series of 'dreams' and 'flashbacks' that [she] had immediately following the events on 30 August 2000"" prior to the preparation of the second statement and that this information was known to investigators prior to the 2002 trial, but was not disclosed to the defence.
30The same submission was made in support of the application of Bilal Skaf. I addressed and rejected that contention (Bilal Skaf Application at [36] to [87]). The reasons I gave are equally applicable to Mohammed Skaf's application. In summary the expert psychiatric evidence from the re-trial of Mohamed Ghanem upon which Mohammed Skaf relies and which is said to demonstrate the unreliability of Miss C's evidence is subject to the important caveat that there was no independent corroboration of that part of Miss C's evidence which it is claimed she recalled from her dreams (ie those parts of her evidence which first appeared in her second statement). There is, however, a large body of evidentiary material supporting that part of her evidence, namely the evidentiary material pointing to the sexual assault of her by Bilal Skaf at the Chullora industrial estate (see Bilal Skaf Application at [31] to [35]) and the material concerning Mohammed Skaf which I have referred to above at [26] to [27]).
31Further the expert evidence upon which this submission is based assumes that that part of Miss C's evidence which first emerged in her second statement was exclusively derived from Miss C's dreams or nightmares. For the reasons stated in the Bilal Skaf Application at [67] to [68] I do not consider that assumption is soundly based. It rests upon an overly literal reading of Miss C's evidence.
32Otherwise, for the reasons set out in Bilal Skaf's Application at [78] to [87], I do not accept that the failure of the investigating police to disclose what was stated to them about the process by which Miss C recalled the events described in her second statement involved a breach of the prosecutorial duty of disclosure or casts any doubt upon Mohammed Skaf's guilt.
Second basis for the application:  Miss C's identification of Mohammed Skaf
33The second basis for the application is that Miss C's identification of Mohammed Skaf on a police photoboard on 26 September 2000 was severely compromised by the ""dreams"" and ""flashbacks"" that Miss C experienced and that this was known to the investigators but not disclosed prior to the 2002 trial. This complaint fails for the reasons I have already given, but it is necessary to note the following concerning Miss C's photoboard identification of Mohammed Skaf.
34As I have stated, in her first statement Miss C described one of the offenders as the male in the yellow jumper.  She also stated that he had ""short, curly dark brown hair that was gelled or waxed"" as well as thick eyebrows, acne and spoke with a slight accent.  This description was said not to match Mohammed Skaf.  The submissions of Mohammed Skaf refer to an occasion on 2 September 2000 when Miss C was shown a photo-board that included Mohammed Skaf, but she failed to identify him. The Crown case statement described what occurred in the following terms:
""On 26 September 2000 the complainant identified Mohammed Skaf from a series of fifteen photos on a photo board. He was the male in the yellow jumper. In cross-examination she said that she [had] been first shown the photo board on 2 September 2000 and had told police that  the male in photo 9 looked more like the male than the male in photo 14 because the nose of the male in the latter photo was too big. The complainant explained that she had been confused. She agreed that in a subsequent viewing of the photo board on 21 September 2000 she identified the male as the male depicted in photo 14, this time because of his big nose."" (references omitted) 
The reference to 21 September 2000 in this extract appears to be mistaken.  It is common ground between the parties that Miss C's second viewing of the photoboard took place on 26 September 2000.
35The matters pointed to by Mohammed Skaf concerning his identification on 26 September 2000 by Miss C only reinforce the reasons I gave for rejecting the first basis for his application. As I have said it was not in dispute at the 2002 trial that Mohammed Skaf was the male in the yellow jumper who was present on the train and took Miss C to the toilet block at the Marion street carpark where they had sex (either forced or consensual). Miss C's failure to identify him on the photoboard on 2 September 2000 confirms the fragility of her recollection at that point in time. In contrast she correctly identified him on 26 September 2000 as one of the persons present on 30 August 2000. This was after she had the ""dreams"" and ""flashbacks"" and only serves to confirm that by that time her recollection was more accurate and reliable than it had been on 2 September 2000. Even if her recollection as at 26 September 2000 was exclusively based on her dreams and flashbacks then they were accurate because they apparently enabled her to identify a person, namely Mohammed Skaf, who admitted meeting her on the train and taking her to the toilet block at the Marion Street carpark. 
36As part of his appeal against his conviction Mohammed Skaf complained about the directions given by the trial judge concerning his identification by Miss C. The Court of Criminal Appeal rejected this ground stating (2004 Conviction Appeal at [302]:
""But as regards Mohammed Skaf there is a further air of unreality about this present complaint [about the directions concerning identification]. The real issue touching his guilt in relation to the sexual assault at the industrial complex turned upon the cogency of the evidence that the man who undisputedly was on the train and the first to go into the toilet cubicle at Marion Street was the same as the man in the yellow jumper who turned up at the industrial complex. The complainant gave firm and compelling evidence that he was, and this evidence drew considerable support from the independent material about the mobile phone and the SIM card in it."" 
37This passage confirms that the only real issue of identification concerning Mohammed Skaf was whether the male in the yellow jumper that she met on the train was also present at the industrial estate. The evidence concerning his mobile phone usage and Miss C's SIM card strongly supports her evidence that he was. 
Third basis for the application:  Non disclosure of the finger- printing of the toilets. 
38The third basis of Mohammed Skaf's application is that there was a failure on the part of the Crown to disclose to the defence that fingerprint evidence was taken from the toilets at the Marion street carpark.
39The Crown case statement records that the following evidence was led at the trial concerning the state of the toilet block:""There were three toilets in the Marion Street car park: a male toilet on the left, a female toilet in the middle and a disabled toilet on the right. The middle toilet was clean and tidy, but the door was broken off the top hinge. The complainant told Constable Norris that she had been sexually assaulted in there. The toilet was cleaned early in the morning on 31 August 2000 by Wayne Jaubert, from Bankstown Council, and his co-worker. Jaubert gave evidence of having seen damage in the men's toilet, including a broken lock on the door, a broken paper holder and a broken seat. The door to the ladies toilet was broken, and the latch for the bolt on the locking mechanism was missing, suggesting that the door had been forced off. The toilet seat was also broken off."" (Reference omitted) 
40The Crown case statement also states that the first time Miss C approached the police was at 1.30pm on 31 August 2000. Thus the earliest time the police could have inspected the toilets was after they had been cleaned.
41At some point during the 2002 trial and after the Crown had closed its case Sergeant Michael Porta gave evidence on a voir dire. On this application, it was not made clear what the voir dire related to but the transcript suggests that it concerned the contents of a statement of a co offender, ""H"", that was served on the defence. In any event on the voir dire Detective Porta gave the following evidence about his attempts to identify the woman who spoke to Miss C when she emerged from the toilets:""In relation to - I'm not sure if it was Mrs Langley or Ms Francis [Counsel for the defence] asked (sic) about the black junkie - those enquiries, the only person that came to light there was a woman called Genevieve Strickland, whose palm print was found in the toilets and she was in custody as at 30 August, so that enquiry led to nothing and she was a person who did in fact have some darkened skin.""  (emphasis added).
42The submissions of Mohammed Skaf point to this as evidence that the toilet block was fingerprinted. They also rely on an entry in Senior Constable Brazel's duty book dated 19 September 2000 which is said to read: ""then to fingerprints major crime Ferguson Centre Parramatta re [Miss C's surname] elimination prints"".
43The submissions on behalf of Mohammed Skaf contend that the finding of a print in the toilets suggests that the toilets had not been washed or cleaned prior to the police fingerprinting them and that that fact should have been disclosed to the defence. The relevance of this is said to relate to the accuracy of Miss C's description of how she was sexually assaulted in the toilet block in the Marion Street carpark. In her evidence she described being sexually assaulted from behind while pinned against a wall by the male in the yellow jumper. In her first statement she described having her hands placed on the wall during the assault that occurred immediately after the assault by the male in the yellow jumper. It was submitted that Mohammed Skaf was ""severely prejudiced"" by the failure to disclose this material (and denied the benefit of) any ""implications consistent with innocence that might have been disclosed by the finger print evidence"".
44The Attorney General's submissions note that the entry in Senior Constable Brazel's duty book does not indicate what locations, vehicles or objects the elimination prints were obtained from. Otherwise they point to the cleaner's evidence and note that at the trial Mohammed Skaf's counsel did not ask any question about the fingerprinting of the toilets. The Crown submits that, as it was common ground that Mohammed Skaf was in the toilet block, it is ""not surprising"" that his Counsel did not take the matter further at the 2002 trial. I understand this to mean that his Counsel accepted that the result of any such fingerprinting could not have assisted his client's case.
45It is regrettable that the Crown has not supplied a full explanation of what fingerprinting or palm printing was undertaken, when it was undertaken and why it was that this material was not disclosed prior to the 2002 trial. In the absence of such an explanation I must approach the matter on the basis that fingerprinting of the toilets was undertaken and was not but should have been disclosed prior to the 2002 trial (see the discussion in the Bilal Skaf Application at [85] to [86]). Mohammed Skaf's submissions in reply go further and assert that what occurred was a ""deliberate withholding"" of the fingerprints. This suggestion is difficult to reconcile with the fact that Sergeant Porta freely disclosed the obtaining of a palm print in the course of giving a long explanation in his evidence in chief.  If there was a deliberate decision to suppress the fingerprinting or palm printing of the toilets then he would not have disclosed the information in that manner.
46In any event the failure to disclose the fingerprinting does not cause me to have any sense of unease or disquiet concerning Mohammed Skaf's convictions on the counts relating to the sexual assault of Miss C in the toilet block. It follows from the Crown case statement, which was in turn taken from the evidence led at the trial, that the fingerprinting could have only been undertaken after the toilets were cleaned.  It is quite conceivable that the cleaning process could have removed some, but not all, of the prints. Hence a palm print of ""Genevieve Strickland"" was obtained. If Miss C's prints were not found in the location that she indicated by her evidence that would be consistent with them being washed away. If her prints were found in other parts of the toilet then that would not be inconsistent with her version either. It was common ground at the 2002 trial that Mohammed Skaf was in the toilet block so the presence or absence of his prints would be neutral. Thus the presence or absence of Miss C's fingerprints or Mohammed Skaf's fingerprints was irrelevant to the issues at the 2002 trial.
47The conclusion that the outcome of any fingerprint analysis of the toilet block would not have been of any assistance to Mohammed Skaf's defence is reinforced by the complete absence of any protest or even query at the 2002 trial when Sergeant Porta volunteered that a palm print had been obtained from the toilet block. 
48I have referred above to the evidence of Miss C's friend Leah confirming that Miss C texted her and that she attempted to contact Miss C only to be told ""[l]isten bitch, your sister will be home in ten to twenty minutes"" with the phone later being switched off (see above at [19]). This evidence is completely inconsistent with any suggestion that at that point Miss C was willingly accompanying Mohammed Skaf for consensual sex in the toilet block near the Marion Street carpark. Mohammed Skaf's assertion that he had consensual sex with Miss C in the toilet block after having met her on the train was specious. 
49It follows that this matter does not cause me to have a sense of unease or disquiet concerning Mohammed Skaf's guilt. It does not raise a doubt or question as to his guilt or as to any part of the evidence in the case against him.
Further Matter:  Medical Evidence
50In Mohammed Skaf's submissions in reply it was contended that the evidence given by Dr Marie Anne Nittis was ""inconsistent"" with Miss C's account. Accompanying the submission was an unsigned expert certificate said to be from Dr Nittis and bearing the date 15 April 2007. In that certificate, Dr Nittis does not specify the question she was asked to address beyond stating that she was asked to comment on the findings of Dr Edwards concerning the injuries suffered by Miss C. Contrary to what was submitted, Dr Nittis' report is not ""inconsistent"" with Miss C's account. Dr Nittis stated that it is ""not unusual to conduct a genital examination, after an assault, and find absolutely no genital injuries at all"".  The most favourable part of her report for Mohammed Skaf is her statement that she was ""surprised"" that Miss C could have been sexually assaulted as she stated and emerge ""essentially unscathed"". However, nothing in her report suggests that that was either impossible or even unlikely. 
51This aspect of Mohammed Skaf's application does not raise a doubt or question as to his guilt. 
Conclusion
52None of the matters relied on raise a doubt or a question as to Mohammed Skaf's guilt nor do they give rise to a doubt or question about the evidence demonstrating his guilt.
53I refuse the application.

2707056,"SKAF, Bilal - Application under Part 7 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2013] NSWSC 45","Introduction

1Pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (the ""Review Act""), Mr Bilal Skaf seeks an inquiry into his convictions for offences he was found to have committed on 30 August 2000. He submits that the matter should be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal, pursuant to s 79(1)(b) of the Review Act, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 

2Bilal Skaf was tried for those offences along with his brother Mohammed Skaf and two others. Mohammed Skaf was also convicted. He has also made an application under s 78 of the Review Act which was also referred to me. At the time of the publication of this decision I am also publishing my decision refusing Mohammed Skaf's application (Application of Mohammed Skaf [2013] NSWSC 181 (the ""Mohammed Skaf Application""). This decision should be read together with that decision. I use the same terminology in this decision as in that decision.

3In support of his application Bilal Skaf makes three related complaints. First, he contends that there is the requisite doubt about his convictions because he has become aware of expert evidence that he contends demonstrates the unreliability of the complainant's evidence. In particular he contends that, in her evidence at his trial, the complainant described a process of recalling those parts of her evidence that incriminated him while she was asleep yet the expert evidence he points to demonstrates that evidence recalled in that manner is not reliable. 

4As further explained below, I reject that contention for two related reasons (see [61] to [71]). The expert evidence relied on was adduced in the course of Mohamed Ghanem's retrial, and is subject to the caveat that there was no independent corroboration of that part of the complainant's evidence that incriminated Mr Ghanem which it is said she recalled through sleeping. However in Bilal Skaf's case that part of her evidence pointing to his involvement was strongly corroborated by telephone records which place him at the scene of some of the sexual assaults and his own admissions. Thus, even if it is correct to say that the complainant only recalled his presence through a process of dreaming, then the accuracy of that recollection so far as it concerned Bilal Skaf was to a very significant degree confirmed. 

5Further, I do not accept an assumption upon which the expert opinion relied on by Bilal Skaf is based, namely that the complainant's evidence was exclusively derived from dreams or nightmares (and that, in effect, she is merely reciting what she dreamt). I consider that this assumption relies on an overly literal reading of the complainant's description of her process of recalling the events that she gave evidence about.

6Second, Bilal Skaf contends that there is doubt about his conviction because the trial judge failed to give a direction concerning the unreliability of the complainant's evidence as it was derived from her dreams. No such direction was sought and no such direction was required (see [72] to [77]). 

7Third, Bilal Skaf contends that the prosecution failed to disclose in advance of his trial the complainant's statement that she had dreamt the sequence of events incriminating him. I do not accept that the failure of the prosecution to disclose this information was a breach of its duty to disclose or that it casts doubt upon Bilal Skaf's guilt. 

8Accordingly the application is refused. 

Convictions and Sentences

9On 6 December 2000 Bilal Skaf was charged with a number of offences that arose out of a series of sexual assaults committed against a victim, Miss ""C"", on 30 August 2000 (referred to as Miss ""T"" on appeal: R v Chami, M. Skaf, Ghanem and B. Skaf [2004] NSWCCA 36).

10His trial on those offences commenced before Finnane DCJ and a District Court jury on 29 April 2002 (the ""2002 trial""). As I have said, he stood trial with his brother, Mohammed Skaf. He was also tried with Mahmoud Chami and Mohamed Ghanem. There were 17 counts on the indictment of which 8 counts concerned Bilal Skaf, namely:

Count 3: Detain for sexual advantage;

Count 4: Aggravated indecent assault in company;

Count 5: Aggravated act of indecency in company; 

Count 6: Aggravated sexual intercourse without consent (in company);

Count 10: Aggravated sexual intercourse without consent (in company);

Count 12: Aggravated sexual intercourse without consent;

Count 16: Attempt to pervert the course of justice; and 

Count 17: Incite an attempt to pervert the course of justice.

11Bilal Skaf pleaded guilty to counts 16 and 17 and not guilty to the remainder that charged him. On 7 June 2002 the jury returned verdicts of guilty on those remaining counts except count 12 upon which they could not agree. His co-accused were also found guilty on various counts.

12Bilal Skaf was subsequently sentenced by Finnane DCJ to a lengthy period of imprisonment for those 7 counts and other similar offences in respect of which he had been found guilty (noted in Bilal Skaf v R; Mohammed Skaf v R [2008] NSWCCA 303 at [9] and [84]). For reasons unconnected to this application those sentences were varied at different times on appeal (see R v Bilal Skaf; R v Mohammed Skaf [2004] NSWCCA 37; 60 NSWLR 86, R v Bilal Skaf [2005] NSWCCA 297, and Bilal Skaf v R; Mohammed Skaf v R [2008] NSWCCA 303). The end result is that for the offences committed on 30 August 2000 he is serving sentences aggregating 20 years with an effective non-parole period of 14 years dating from 12 February 2009 (R v Bilal Skaf [2005] NSWCCA 297 at [138]). The total effective sentence for all the offences he has been convicted of expires on 11 February 2037 with him being eligible for release on 11 February 2031(Bilal Skaf v R; Mohammed Skaf v R [2008] NSWCCA 303 at [105]).

13Bilal Skaf appealed against his convictions for the offences concerning Miss C other than counts 16 and 17 to which he pleaded guilty. His co-offenders also appealed (R v Chami, M. Skaf, Ghanem, B. Skaf [2004] NSWCCA 36 (the ""2004 Conviction Appeal"")). The Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed the appeals of all the appellants, with the exception of Mohamed Ghanem. His conviction was quashed and a new trial was ordered (2004 Conviction Appeal at [343]).

14On 9 September 2005 Bilal Skaf, Belal Hajeid and Mohamed Ghanem applied to the High Court for special leave to appeal against their convictions relating to similar offences committed against other individuals, and Bilal Skaf also sought special leave to appeal against his conviction for the offences against Miss C committed on 30 August 2000. The High Court refused the applications (Skaf v R; Hajeid v R; Ghanem v R [2005] HCATrans 744).

15As noted, an order was made that Mohamed Ghanem be retried for his role in the assaults committed against Miss C on 30 August 2000. In 2004 evidence was given on a voir dire on an application by Mr Ghanem to exclude, inter alia, the evidence of Miss C (the ""2004 Voir dire""). The trial judge rejected that application but upheld an application to exclude other evidence sought to be adduced by the Crown. A Crown appeal from that decision was upheld in 2005 (R v G [2005] NSWCCA 291). 

16Mr Ghanem was ultimately retried in April 2007 (the ""2007 retrial""). The complainant did not give evidence. Instead the evidence she gave at the 2002 trial was read to the jury. Mr Ghanem was acquitted.

Statutory Context

17Sections 78 and 79 of the Review Act provide:

""78 Applications to Supreme Court

(1) An application for an inquiry into a conviction or sentence may be made to the Supreme Court by the convicted person or by another person on behalf of the convicted person.

(2) The registrar of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court must cause a copy of any application made under this section to be given to the Minister.

79 Consideration of applications

(1) After considering an application under section 78 or on its own motion:
(a) the Supreme Court may direct that an inquiry be conducted by a judicial officer into the conviction or sentence, or
(b) the Supreme Court may refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
(2) Action under subsection (1) may only be taken if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person's guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case.
(3) The Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application. Without limiting the foregoing, the Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application if:
(a) it appears that the matter:
(i) has been fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction or sentence (or in any proceedings on appeal from the conviction or sentence), or
(ii) has previously been dealt with under this Part or under the previous review provisions, or
(iii) has been the subject of a right of appeal (or a right to apply for leave to appeal) by the convicted person but no such appeal or application has been made, or
(iv) has been the subject of appeal proceedings commenced by or on behalf of the convicted person (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) where the appeal or application has been withdrawn or the proceedings have been allowed to lapse, and
(b) the Supreme Court is not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action.
(3A) The Supreme Court may defer consideration of an application under section 78 if:
(a) the time within which an appeal may be made against the conviction or sentence (including an application for leave to appeal) is yet to expire, or
(b) the conviction or sentence is the subject of appeal proceedings (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) that are yet to be finally determined, or
(c) the application fails to disclose sufficient information to enable the conviction or sentence to be properly considered.
(4) Proceedings under this section are not judicial proceedings. However, the Supreme Court may consider any written submissions made by the Crown with respect to an application.
(5) The registrar of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court must report to the Minister as to any action taken by the Supreme Court under this section (including a refusal to consider or otherwise deal with an application).""

18The applicant seeks a reference, pursuant to s 79(1)(b) of the Review Act, to the Court of Criminal Appeal to deal with this matter as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. I note that my discretion pursuant to s 78 is broader than simply the power to refer and that pursuant to these provisions I have the power to refer the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal (s 79(1)(b)); to direct that the matter be the subject of an inquiry (s 79(1)(a)); to defer the matter (s 79(3A)); or to refuse the application (s 79(3)) on the basis of grounds including, but not limited to those specified in s 79(3). 

19The processes undertaken to reach one of the above outcomes differs substantially from those applicable in judicial proceedings (see Application of Peter James Holland Under s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2008] NSWSC 251 (""Holland"") at [2] to [12] per Johnson J). I note three matters discussed by Johnson J in Holland. 

20First, my consideration of this application is an exercise of administrative, not judicial power (Varley v Attorney General (NSW) (1987) 8 NSWLR 30 at 48 to 50; Eastman v Director of Public Prosecutions (ACT) [2003] HCA 28; 214 CLR 318 at [124]). This process may be activated when the criminal justice system has ""run its course following trial and appeal and, in almost every case, where additional evidence has come to light which is said to raise a doubt or question as to guilt or sentence"" (Holland at [10]). Johnson J noted that s 78 is not intended to provide a convicted person with yet another avenue of appeal after the appeal process has been exhausted, nor an opportunity to run the trial again on paper (Holland at [9]).

21Secondly, the test to be applied in proceedings of this nature is whether it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the applicant's guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case, or as to any part of the evidence in the case (s 79(2)). Under the now-repealed, but similarly phrased s 475 of the Crimes Act 1900, it was said that the requisite view may be formed where the material submitted causes the person considering the matter ""unease or a sense of disquiet"" in allowing the conviction or sentence to stand (Holland at [6], citing Varley v Attorney General (NSW) at 48; Application of Rendell (1987) 32 A Crim R 243 at 245). This requires available material which ""as a matter of practical reality"" gives rise to the sense of unease or disquiet (Holland at [8]). That formula has been applied in applications made under s 79(2) (Holland at [6]). 

22Thirdly, there is a degree of flexibility regarding the ""materials"" which I may consider and upon what basis I may consider them. In relation to this, Johnson J stated (in Holland at [11]): 
""The nature of the jurisdiction under Pt 7 involves some flexibility in the material which may be placed before a judge in support of an application for an order directing an inquiry or referring the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal.""

23Consistent with this I have determined the matter on the papers. I have considered all the documents annexed to the application of Mr Skaf and to the submissions of the Attorney-General. 

24Further, I note that s 79(2) of the Review Act refers not only to a doubt or question about the convicted person's guilt but also ""as to any part of the evidence in the case"". It is possible for there to be a doubt or question about such evidence even if there is no doubt or question about the convicted person's guilt (Varley at 46 per Hope JA; Eastman [2003] HCA 28; 214 CLR 318 at [123] per Heydon J). The example given in Varley concerned the ordering of an inquiry to redress unjustified attacks on a particular Crown witness. However in this case I would not exercise the power conferred by s 79(1) to either order an inquiry or refer the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal unless any question or doubt that might be raised about the evidence or part of it against Bilal Skaf was such as to give rise to ""unease or [a] sense of disquiet"" about his convictions.

The Crown Case

25Before addressing the grounds put forward in Bilal Skaf's application it is necessary to describe the Crown case. The following summary is taken from the 2004 Conviction Appeal at [3] to [48] which was based upon the evidence given by Miss C at the 2002 trial. It conveniently identifies the particular conduct said to have constituted the charges on the indictment:

""3 The complainant boarded a train at Belmore, intending to go to Lidcombe. She was sitting reading when approached by a group of five young males. The Crown case was that these men were: 
Mohammed Skaf, the appellant
H, a pseudonym for a person whose name has been suppressed
Tayyab Sheikh
Mohammed Sanoussi
Mahmoud Sanoussi

4 Mohammed Skaf was described by the complainant as wearing a yellow jumper and having a really big nose and curly short hair with blond streaks. He sat in front of the complainant and engaged her in friendly conversation. Having ascertained that she had tried marijuana he asked her if she wanted to smoke some with them. She agreed to do so and to continue with the men to Bankstown Station. She told them that her name was ""Amanda"", which was untrue. 

5 During the train ride some of the males touched her suggestively. In Ms T's words, the man in the yellow jumper had ""tried to touch me a few times... but I didn't really think that much of it... I remember him in particular saying that I had nice legs"". 

6 Closed circuit television at Bankstown Station provided video evidence corroborating the arrival of the group and assisting identification to some degree. The complainant is seen on the platform with five males, the male in the yellow jumper holding his arm around her as they walk off the platform in a group. 

7 The complainant sent a mobile text message to her friend Leah Nightingale and told her to call her. When Leah rang back, the complainant made it sound as if she was talking to her sister, that their mother had been in an accident and that she had to go home. The complainant said that she was starting to feel nervous and that she wanted an excuse to go home without antagonising the men. The other males ""had sort of gotten a bit more gropey, they were trying to touch me a lot more and I was starting to get a bit nervous about them"" [reference omitted].

8 The male in the yellow jumper took Ms T's phone and started speaking to Leah. He told her ""I'll have her home in ten minutes"" and hung up on her. He then placed the phone down the front of his pants. The complainant asked for her phone back and was told ""No. I'll give it back to you after we've smoken"". 

9 The complainant's friend Leah corroborated this evidence about the disguised phone call and the complainant's nervous or panicky state [reference omitted]. She said that she was told by the male speaker ""Listen bitch, your sister will be home in ten to twenty minutes."" He refused to let Leah speak to the complainant and hung up. When Leah phoned back the phone was switched off. By this time three of the five males had moved away. The complainant remained with the male in the yellow jumper (Mohammed Skaf) and a male with badly streaked hair. They walked her to the nearby Marion Street car park. 

10 The male in the yellow jumper went into the toilet block for a couple of minutes. He came back out and said ""You're up"". The male with the streaked hair had been talking to the complainant in the meantime and he had asked her if she did threesomes: she told him ""No, I don't do things like that"". 

11 The complainant followed the male in the yellow jumper into the toilet block. He took her mobile phone out of his pants, held it up in the air and said ""You won't get your phone back until you fuck me"". She replied ""Fuck the phone, I'm going home"" and she tried to get out. She pushed the door to get out, but did not realize that it opened the other way. She heard voices from the outside and assumed that the other males had been holding the door closed. 

12 The male reached for her shoulders and she dodged him to get away and found herself further away from the door. She was now near the toilet. The male approached her and pushed her up against the tiled wall, turned her around and pulled down her skirt and underwear. This was the basis of Count 1 against Mohammed Skaf - detain for sexual advantage. 

13 The male told her ""I'm going to fuck you Leb style"". He put on a condom (which had been purchased when he had entered a pink building housing a sex shop on the way between the station and the car park).

14 Mohammed Skaf stood behind her, pinning her up against the wall and penetrated his penis in her vagina. At the time she heard the other males outside. When he finished it seemed to the complainant that he was not allowed to get out of the cubicle without communicating (in Lebanese) with the men on the outside. This assault, in the company of others, was the subject of Count 2 against Mohammed Skaf - aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. 

15 The complainant was thereafter subjected to a series of sexual assaults in the toilet from the males she had met on the train, with the exception of H. During this time she heard her mobile phone's ring tone. The male in the yellow jumper had earlier placed it back in his pocket [reference omitted].

16 The assaults in the toilet (after that involving Mohammed Skaf) first involved an incident in which two males entered the toilet block. The complainant was lifted down from the toilet seat by one of them, who pulled down her skirt and underwear, pushed her up against the wall and placed his finger into her vagina. He then wore a condom and placed his penis into her vagina. After this, the man alleged to be Mohammed Sanousi entered as the complainant was fixing herself up. She had fallen to her knees. He said ""you're in the position to suck my dick"" and he put his penis into her mouth. She tried to pull away. He grabbed her hair and moved her head around his penis all the way down her throat which made her gag. When this male left, the one with the ""badly streaked hair"" returned. He sat on the toilet, opened his legs and pulled down his pants. He grabbed the complainant and forced his penis into her mouth. She was still in a kneeling position. 

17 Evidence was led that H, Tayyab Sheikh, Mohammed Sanoussi and Mahmoud Sanoussi had also been charged and were being dealt with in other proceedings. 

18 The evidence of these other sexual assaults in the toilet was led without objection and was not the subject of any cross-examination. It was obviously relevant to the issue of consent as regards what followed, and debatably as regards what preceded it [reference omitted]. 

19 The complainant was left on her own inside the toilet. She cried. She then got dressed, washed herself and walked outside. A dark-skinned woman in her early thirties approached her and asked if she was OK. The woman asked if she had any money. Believing that the woman was offering help, the complainant gave her $20 expecting her to call a taxi. The woman told the complainant ""You know this is a bad area, you should have known better"". She put her arm around the complainant and led her to a nearby area where there were a group of males outside a black car. The complainant noticed the male with the large build (H) and a couple of males who had been with her earlier. Two of the males then left with the woman. Mohammed Skaf was also there. The complainant asked him where her phone was and he said that ""his mate George had it and that he would come back with it in a few minutes"". He left and did not return [reference omitted].

20 Thinking that she was safe, the complainant got into the black car containing two previously unencountered males and H. The complainant described it as a black two door hatchback that looked new. She thought she would be taken to the police. There was talk about retrieving her phone. H left the car and spoke to Mohammed Skaf, returning with the complainant's SIM card. He said that they could not get her phone back. As the black car drove off from the area, the complainant saw the male in the yellow jumper (Mohammed Skaf) and the male in the orange jumper (Mohammed Sanoussi) sitting in a hot food shop. The black car was driven from the Marion Street car park to Bankstown Trotting Club, stopping en route to buy food at McDonalds. It was near to dusk when they got to the Trotting Club. 

21 H committed a further sexual assault on the complainant near a shed in the deserted car park. After this, the black car reappeared and its driver told the complainant that he would take her home. She trusted him and got into the front passenger seat. He then forced his finger into her vagina. Later he required her to climb into the back seat where he undressed her and had forced penile vaginal sex. After this another man who had been a passenger in the black car got into the back seat and had forced oral sex. 

22 The complainant tried to get out of the car after she had fixed herself up. Someone held the door closed and told her ""wait in here"" [reference omitted].

23 The complainant then saw a red car drive into the car park of the Bankstown Trotting Club. There were four males in that car. The complainant had not seen them before. The driver and passenger from the black car went up to the males in the red car and they appeared to talk to each other. The driver of the black car returned and opened the passenger door to let the complainant out saying ""You're going with these guys. They're going to take you home"". 

24 The complainant got into the red car believing what she had been told. She got into the middle of the back seat. It was the Crown case that the men in the red car were: 

Mahmoud Chami (the driver and, for this the Crown relied mainly on Chami's admission in his ERISP of 13 October 2000). He was described by the complainant as having short, cropped hair, bushy eyebrows, bulging eyes and he was wearing a big black jacket.
Mohamed Ghanem (the front passenger, and for this the Crown relied on the complainant's subsequent identification of Ghanem from a photoboard). He was described by the complainant as having his hair in a pony tail which had curls and was blondish at the ends and he was wearing a Hawaiian shirt and bone coloured cargo pants.
Bilal Skaf (the back passenger, sitting to the left of the complainant, and for this the Crown relied on the complainant's subsequent identification of Bilal Skaf from a photoboard). He was described by the complainant as calling himself ""Sam"", with dark eyes, short dark hair, bushy eyebrows and he was wearing a grey Adidas jumper. The complainant said that she remembered ""something about gold, a gold necklace or gold"" [reference omitted]. He was often referred to as ""Adidas Sam"" in later evidence.
A fourth unidentified male (the back passenger, sitting to the right of the complainant). He was described by the complainant as having short curly hair with blonde or gold on the tips and wearing a grey Nike jumper. He also called himself Sam.

25 The red car was driven to a townhouse complex where it stopped for a few minutes while the driver got out and entered a house. The house was subsequently identified by the complainant as being opposite Chami's house. Count 3 charged Chami, Ghanem and Bilal Skaf with detaining for sexual advantage. This count spanned the luring and detaining of the complainant in the red car in the circumstances set out below. 

26 As the complainant was being driven in the red car the two males sitting on either side of her in the back seat started to touch her. They touched her upper thighs and legs and her left breast. Count 4 charged Bilal Skaf with aggravated indecent assault in relation to the touching of her breasts. They also grabbed her hands and put them around each of their exposed penises and moved her hands up and down. They prevented her from pulling her hands away. Count 5 charged Bilal Skaf with an aggravated act of indecency in relation to this incident. 

27 The two Sams then started pulling up her skirt and took turns in putting their fingers into her vagina. Afterwards they both did it together at the same time. Count 6 charged Bilal Skaf with aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. 

28 The complainant was crying during these assaults. She was scared that the men would rape her and thought that they would take her home if she did what they wanted. The complainant said that the front passenger was turning around and watching the activities of the two men beside her. 

29 The car was then driven to a service station not far from the townhouse complex. The front passenger (Ghanem, on the Crown case) got out. The complainant attempted to climb out of the car from the front seat. The driver (Chami) grabbed her left shoulder and pushed her down. He opened the glove box and ""took a weapon and held it to my head"". The complainant felt ""cold metal"" and thought it was a gun, though she did not see it. The driver told her ""don't move bitch or you're dead"". He then put the weapon back and the front passenger returned to the red car. 

30 The complainant was then driven to an industrial estate in Chullora. Everybody except the driver got out of the car. The two males who had been sitting in the back seat held the doors so the complainant could not get out and the driver got into the back seat. It was dark by this time. 

31 The driver of the red car unzipped his pants when he sat next to the complainant in the back seat. She said ""You're not going to do it too?"" and he said ""Fuck me"". He put a condom on his penis, pushed the complainant on to her back and pulled up her skirt. He pulled down her underwear, spread her legs open and had penile vaginal intercourse with her. She was crying at the time. Count 7 charged Chami with aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. During this incident the complainant recalled that a blanket was placed over the car.

32 The driver got out and the male with the pony tail who had been the front passenger came inside the red car. The male said ""he wanted a little bit of head before he fucked"" and he pulled down her shoulders so that she was almost on all fours. He grabbed her hair and forced her face towards his penis. She tried not to let it go in her mouth and he pulled her even harder and put his penis into her mouth. She bit down on it and he slapped her across the top of her head. He grabbed her hair and forced his penis further down her throat and she started to gag. Count 8 charged Ghanem with aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. 

33 This male then pushed the complainant's head back. She sat back up in a kneeling position. He made her sit on him and he had vaginal sex. She was crying at the time and she believed that a condom was used. Count 9 charged Ghanem with aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. The complainant recalled looking at this male's face, and she remembered that he ""was actually good looking"" [reference omitted].

34 When that male left the car the unidentified ""Sam"" wearing the grey Nike jumper came inside and forced his penis into her mouth. 

35 The male called ""Sam"" in the grey Adidas jumper (Bilal Skaf, on the Crown case) then came into the car. The complainant was crying and he pushed her legs open, straddled her and placed his penis into her vagina. Count 10 charged Bilal Skaf with aggravated sexual intercourse without consent.

36 The male with the pony tail came back via the left side of the car. The complainant was sitting in the middle, crying. He grabbed her shoulders and forced her onto all fours. He unzipped his pants and forced his penis into her mouth. Count 11 charged Ghanem with aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. 

37 Not long afterwards, this male yelled out ""How about a threesome"" and the male called ""Sam"" in the grey Adidas jumper reentered the car and put his penis into the complainant's anus while she was on all fours. At the same time the male with the pony tail had his penis in her mouth. Count 12 charged Bilal Skaf with aggravated sexual intercourse without consent in relation to this incident. [Upon this count the jury did not agree upon a verdict]

38 The Crown originally indicted Ghanem on a further count (Count 13) of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent in respect of the incident referred to in the previous paragraph. Since however the complainant explained in her evidence that when the male with the pony tail had yelled out ""how about a threesome"" his penis had remained in her mouth throughout that time, the judge later directed a verdict by direction on Count 13 because the offence in Count 11 had not ceased. 

39 The complainant said that throughout the sexual assaults in the red car she heard mobile phones ringing and people talking on the phone [reference omitted]. Around this time she saw a black car arrive. She said it was ""a black car, similar to the first"", but was not sure whether it was the same car as the one previously involved [reference omitted]. There were three males in it along with the male in the yellow jumper who had first met the complainant on the train and who had also sexually assaulted her in the toilet block (Mohammed Skaf, on the Crown case). She heard the ring tone of her phone, which was a particular song by Eminem [reference omitted]. This evidence was used to corroborate the Crown case that Mohammed Skaf arrived at the industrial complex in the black car. (He admitted his presence at the Marion Street toilet block, but disputed that he was at the industrial complex.)

40 The complainant got out of the red car, which was then 
driven away towards the driveway of the industrial estate where it was hosed down. The black car was parked where the red car had previously been. The complainant attempted to leave and started walking past the red car. She was hosed down by someone from the red car and ended up soaking wet [reference omitted]. She started crying and the males laughed. The complainant managed to reach the street but was caught by one of the ""new people"" and was led back to the industrial estate. By the time she had been walked back she noticed that the red car and its occupants were gone. 

41 The male in the yellow jumper came up to her, put his arm around her and led her away from the remaining group of males. He said ""I have to talk to you"" and she was taken to an area where there was a pile of sacks. Count 14 charged Mohammed Skaf with detain for advantage. 

42 This male told the complainant to ""Suck my dick again bitch"", and she did as she was told because she was scared of getting hurt. She was still crying. (Count 15 charged Mohammed Skaf with aggravated sexual intercourse without consent.) (The complainant volunteered that she had not had oral sex with the male in the yellow jumper at the toilet block [reference omitted] but she adhered to the evidence that the same man was involved in the two separate assaults. This was material relied upon by Mohammed Skaf to challenge the complainant's identification of him as the male in the yellow jumper at the industrial estate.) 

43 After this, the complainant grabbed his penis hard and told him to give her back her phone because she wanted to call someone to get her out of there [reference omitted].He called out, ""Get the gun, get the gun"". Another male (one of the new people not recognized by the complainant) said ""Get her phone back"". 

44 There were other sexual assaults by occupants of the black car. 

45 The complainant was told to get back into the black car, which had been driven over to the area with the sacks. She complied. Just before the car pulled out of the driveway, the person in the yellow jumper came up to the driver's side window and passed her mobile through to the person who had just assaulted her. He was seated next to her in the back of the car. He handed the phone to her and told her to put her SIM card in it, which she did. He asked for her phone number because he was going to ring her the next day. He told her to give him the right phone number because he was going to try it there and then to see if her phone rang. She did as she required and the number was successfully tested as she was driven to Lidcombe station [reference omitted]. Mohammed Skaf's mobile phone was found to contain the complainant's number listed in it, showing her name as ""Amanda"", the name she had given on the train.

46 The complainant was then driven to Lidcombe station and was told not to call the police. After being left she started to receive calls on her mobile. One was from her friend Leah, who came to pick her up with Leah's mother. It was now between 10 and 11pm. 

47 Before she was picked up she heard her mobile phone ring several times. She ""knew it was them"" [reference omitted] and didn't answer, except for one call, which came from H to whom she had given her number earlier in the evening [reference omitted]. After she was picked up, Leah answered the calls, some of whom were men asking to talk to her and Leah was heard telling them abusively not to contact her. 

48 The complainant did not go to the police until the next day because she was too distraught."" (emphasis in original)

26To this summary it should be noted that in November 2000 the police were investigating Mohammed Skaf in relation to these incidents. Around this time, Bilal Skaf provided the police with a statement that he, Bilal Skaf, had been home all day on 30 August 2000 and that his brother Mohammed had been home for most of the evening in question including between 4pm and 5pm and around 8.15pm (2004 Conviction Appeal at [72]). Count 16 charged Bilal Skaf with perverting the course of justice by making this (false) statement and count 17 charged him with the same offence for inciting their cousin, Susan Bakry, to make a false statement corroborating Bilal Skaf's alibi for his brother. As I have stated Bilal Skaf pleaded guilty to both counts.

27At the 2002 trial Mr Ghanem's case was that he had been wrongly identified and had an alibi. He gave evidence to that effect. Mahmoud Chami's case was that he only had oral and not vaginal sexual intercourse with Miss C and had a mistaken belief that she consented. He did not give evidence. Mohammed Skaf asserted that he had consensual sex with Miss C in the toilet block in the Marion Street carpark and denied that he was the man in the ""yellow jumper"" who assaulted her at the Chullora industrial estate (2004 Conviction Appeal at [52] and [55]). I describe the Crown case against him and the evidence supporting it in more detail in the Mohammed Skaf Application at [11] to [27]. 

28Bilal Skaf did not give evidence at the 2002 trial. He contended that he had been wrongly identified by Miss C (2004 Conviction Appeal at [54]). It is necessary to describe further aspects of the Crown case against him. The Court of Criminal Appeal stated that there were four ""major items of evidence"" in the Crown case against him (2004 Conviction Appeal at [95] to [99]).

29First, there was the evidence of Miss C which is in part summarised above and which included a ""photoboard"" identification of Bilal Skaf. The investigating police compiled a number of photoboards, each with fifteen photographs of young men of ""Lebanese"" appearance. On 15 November 2000 Miss C identified Bilal Skaf from one of these boards (2004 Conviction Appeal at [62]). Although this evidence was objected to at the trial none of his grounds of appeal attacked its admission. Instead he complained about the reliability of the identification of him by Miss C under the rubric of contending that his conviction was unreasonable. The Court of Criminal Appeal rejected this complaint stating (at [341] to [342]):
""341 ... The jury had the video-recording of the whole process. The complainant looked at the photoboard and said 'Number 15 sort of looks familiar' in relation to the person she called 'Sam 2'. Detective Porta asked her how sure she was and she said 'I'm not 100% sure ... but he looks a hell of a lot like the person I identified as Sam 2' [reference omitted]. His eyebrows stood out to her. In her evidence she explained that she was not 100% sure because it was not a very good photo [reference omitted]. 

342 There was also the additional evidence implicating Bilal Skaf to which we have already drawn attention.""

30Second, the Crown relied on the false statement of Bilal Skaf made to the police about his being home all day on 30 August 2000 and which was the subject of count 16 as evidence of a consciousness of guilt on his part. Over objection the trial judge instructed the jury to that effect. The Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed Bilal Skaf's challenge to the trial judge's ruling (2004 Conviction Appeal at [304] to [314]).

31Third, there was evidence that Bilal Skaf ""used his phone from the area of Chullora industrial estate at the critical time (shortly after 9pm)"" (2004 Conviction Appeal at [98]). This was described in the Crown case statement which was extracted by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the 2004 Conviction Appeal at [117] as follows:
""In respect of 0414 076 468 (the mobile phone of Bilal Skaf):
A call was made from within the 21168 sector at 6:44pm (to ""H"" on 0404 227 642).
A call was made to ""H"" from another sector (28633) at 6:59pm. This was from the Centenary Drive cell.
A call was made from within the 21163 sector at 8:33pm (to Vodafone), though in cross-examination Simmons said that the network may have taken this call on the 900 frequency even though the caller was within the 21168 sector because the duration of the call was short and the network may not have had time to react and place the call on the 1800 frequency.
At 9:02pm there was a text message sent to Ali Skaf on 0415 889 122.
Calls were made from within the 21168 sector at 9:02pm and 9:09pm (to Ali Skaf on 0415 889 122) and at 9:58pm and at 10:37pm (to Nina on 0404 076 763, who was listed in his phone as his girlfriend).
At 9:24pm there was a call to 9703 1468 (the house of Bilal and Mohammed Skaf) from the Chullora cell. This was in sector 22752, which was the same sector in which Ghanem and Chami resided. The Crown relied on this to show that he was involved in dropping his co-offenders home.
Calls were made from within the 21163 sector at 10:17pm and 10:44pm (to Mohammed Skaf on 0415 681 064) and at 10:45pm (to Nina on 0404 076 763).
...""

Sector 21168 served calls made to or from the Chullora industrial complex. Sector 21163 served calls made to or from an area that included Valentia street which was the location of the home of Bilal and Mohammed Skaf (2004 Conviction Appeal at [115] to [116]).

32Thus calls were made from Bilal Skaf's telephone from within the mobile phone cell that serviced the Chullora industrial complex at at least 9.02pm, 9.09pm, 9.58pm and 10.37pm. The above description suggests that a similar call was also made at 9.24pm, although it is not clear. 

33Fourth, there were intercepts of incriminating telephone calls made by Bilal Skaf in the period October to November 2000 (2004 Conviction Appeal at [99]). Two conversations involving Bilal Skaf are particularly telling. In one of them Bilal Skaf issues instructions to Tahir Sheikh (the brother of Tayyab Sheikh) as to what to tell the police as to his brother's movements on that day, but adds ""That's all you have to remember, don't tell 'em where I was, just watch what you say"" [emphasis added].

34In another conversation on the same day with Susan Bakry, Bilal Skaf tells her what to say to the police. She said to him ""they're gunna fuck you hard"" and he replied ""[They can't catch me] no way [they can catch me]"" (bracketed words in Arabic; emphasis added).

35As I will explain these third and fourth aspects of the case against Bilal Skaf are critical to the outcome of this application. The recorded conversations constitute powerful admissions that Bilal Skaf was, in some manner, involved in the sexual assault on Miss C. In combination with the third matter this material is very strong evidence that Bilal Skaf was at one of the scenes where sexual assaults were committed against Miss C, namely the Chullora industrial estate, at the time she said that they were committed. Thus, at the very least, it powerfully corroborated Miss C's evidence to the extent that she identified Bilal Skaf as one of the perpetrators and the location of the assaults upon her by him and others. 

The First and Second Statements

36Miss C made two significant statements to the police concerning her recollections of the events of 30 August 2000, the first dated 1 September 2000 (the ""first statement"") and the second dated 21 September 2000 (the ""second statement""). Her evidence at the trial which was summarised by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the 2004 Conviction Appeal reflected the contents of the second statement.

37There were a number of significant differences between the versions of events described in the first and second statements. One change was that in the second statement Miss C said that she accompanied some of the offenders to the Marion Street carpark toilet because she hoped to smoke marijuana with them, whereas in the first statement she said that she did so because they had taken her telephone. She stated that she did not tell the police about this initially because she thought that she might ""get in trouble"". Other changes were of much greater significance. I will note the two most important for the purpose of this application.

38First, the sequence of events and locations at which she was sexually assaulted changed between the first and second statement. Consistent with her evidence at the 2002 trial, in the second statement Miss C described being accosted on the train by a number of offenders, going to the toilet block at the Marion Street carpark where she was sexually assaulted by them, and then leaving that location in a ""black car"" and being taken to the Bankstown trotting club where she was again assaulted. She then describes being transferred to a ""red car"" with different offenders which left the trotting club, and being assaulted in the back of that car while it drove to a townhouse complex, a service station and then to an industrial estate. At the industrial estate she was again sexually assaulted before being driven in a black car to Lidcombe train station. She attached a hand-drawn detailed map of the industrial estate. In her evidence at the 2002 trial she describes locating the industrial complex with the assistance of the police.

39In the first statement Miss C also described being accosted on the train and then taken to the Marion Street carpark toilet where she was sexually assaulted by a number of offenders. However she stated that she was then taken to a service station and the Bankstown trotting club in a red car and sexually assaulted. She stated that she was then driven back to the Marion Street carpark toilet and left there before being driven in a black car to Lidcombe train station.

40Second, there were differences between the first and second statements as to the number and description of the offenders. Thus in her second statement she said that she was accosted by five males on the train but in her first statement she said that she was accosted by six males. Most significantly the second statement contained descriptions of the occupants of the red car that were completely different to the first statement. In her second statement she stated that there were four such occupants which included one person said to be Bilal Skaf. He was referred to by her as ""Sam wearing an Adidas jumper"". As I have noted she later identified Bilal Skaf from a series of photographs as ""Adidas Sam"".

41Thus the person said to be Bilal Skaf was not referred to in the first statement. The conduct said to constitute counts 4, 5 and 6 of the indictment, being the sexual assaults in the red car while it was being driven from the trotting club to the Chullora Industrial estate was not referred to in the first statement. To the extent that counts 3, 10 and 12 had any counterparts in the first statement they involved a different location and different perpetrator(s).

42In her second statement Miss C described the reasons for the difference between the two statements as follows:
""When I made [the first statement] I was suffering from stress and fatigue. I was still shaken from the attack. After having time to recover, I realise that I have been confused when describing some of the events. Since providing the statement, the incident has become a lot clearer in my mind, and I can now provide an accurate account of what occurred that evening."" 

43At the 2002 trial Miss C gave evidence over at least 7 days. She was asked about the reason for the differences between the two statements. Under cross-examination by Mohammed Skaf's counsel she stated: 

""On 1 September, the statement I made then, I made to the best of what I could remember at the time. I later had what I call flashbacks, at night, that had put the pieces together and made me realise that everything was out of sequence and that some things were missing from that statement. I called the police and I told them what I now - what I remembered properly, what had actually occurred that night."" (emphasis added)

44Later, under cross-examination by Bilal Skaf's counsel she gave the following evidence:

""A ... when I had flash-backs I did recall things I had entirely forgotten and other things out of sequence and a McDonalds as well.

Q When you talk about flash-backs when did they occur?
A They occur when I am asleep, sir. 

Q When you were asleep you had a flash-back?
A Yes, I wake up with a nightmare, sir. 

Q: You wake up in the night and you were dreaming about something, is that right?
A.Sir, it's a flash-back, a relieving [sic] of what occurred.

...

Q Did [you] stay awake for a lengthy period of time and focus on that flash-back?
A Yes, I did sir. 

...

Q How long after the statement of 1 September was it that you had your first flash-back?
A I can't exactly remember sir. I remember it was a weekend because I wasn't at home at the time, I was staying at a friend's place. 

...

Q How many other flash-backs have you had?
A I think I had since sir?

Q In this period before you made your second statement?
A I had one that night and my mother called the police that day and I can't remember exactly the date, sir, so bear with me. I did have a few more flash-backs before I actually made the second statement. It reaffirmed what I already knew. 

Q What was that first flash-back about?
A The first flash-back was the sequence of events from the time that I got off that train at Bankstown Station [to] the time that I was dropped off at Lidcombe Station. 

Q You say that this was something that was in the nature of nightmare, is that right?
A Well, it was a nightmare sir, because I was relieving [sic] what I had gone through. 

Q And the events, and the sequence of events that took place that night were, on your evidence, over a considerable number of hours?
A Yes, they were, sir. 

Q And is it your evidence that the flash-back itself contained all of the sequence of events that took place?
A Yes, it did, sir. 

Q So, it wasn't just a momentary waking up with some particular sequence of events, but the whole of [the] sequence of events, is that your evidence?
A Yes, that's correct, sir. 

...

Q Did you go to your statement to see whether or not at the time when you woke up whether your statement had recorded some of the features of that initial flash-back?
A Sir, I didn't look at my statement after I had a flash-back. In my opinion the first statement was worthless. 

...

Q You said that the first statement would be almost useless, is that right?
A Yes sir, because all the sequence of events are out of place and there are people described at places were [sic] they weren't, they were later on, and things like that, just out of sequence. 

...

Q What did concern, what was the features of that flash-back [sic]?
A They were all exactly the same. Just like a video tape from my point of view from start to finish. I relived every single assault.""

45The Court of Criminal Appeal noted that at the 2002 trial Miss C was cross-examined vigorously on the differences between the two statements and her explanation for them (2004 Conviction Appeal at [61]). However as I will next explain, at the 2007 retrial of Mr Ghanem psychiatric evidence was led concerning the description given by Miss C in her evidence extracted above as to how she came to remember the events described in the second statement.

The psychiatric evidence from the 2007 retrial of Mr Ghanem

46As I have already stated the principal ground of Bilal Skaf's application concerns the impact of psychiatric evidence concerning the process of recollection described by Miss C. This psychiatric evidence only became available after the 2004 Conviction Appeal.

47No application was made during the 2002 trial for an adjournment (or a mistrial) to enable psychiatric evidence to be obtained addressing the process of recollection that Miss C described that led to her second statement. However after the Court of Criminal Appeal ordered a retrial for Mr Ghanem he retained a psychiatrist, Dr Roberts, to comment on the reliability of Miss C's account. 

48I have been provided with reports from Dr Roberts, one dated 23 August 2004 and the other dated 30 August 2004. I have also been provided with the transcript of his evidence given on the 2004 voire dire and the 2007 retrial of Mr Ghanem. 

49In his report of 23 August 2004 Dr Roberts refers to both Miss C's statements and aspects of the evidence she gave during the 2002 trial, especially the extracts set out above at [43] to [44]. He noted that Miss C's description of flashbacks was incorrect in that a ""flashback"" is the production of ""intense psychological and physiological reactivity to cues that are reminders of [events]"" and occurs in ""full consciousness"", whereas nightmares are defined as ""anxiety provoking dreams that occur during REM sleep"". Dr Roberts did not accept the accuracy of her description of having repetitive dreams that were occurring in a ""video like fashion"". He stated that the nature of the content of dreams is ""largely symbolic"" and is not reliable ""in relation to matters of fact"", although it may be reliable as a ""symbolic [expression] of concerns and fears that exist at a particular point in time"".

50Dr Roberts concluded:

""... I do not consider that it can be stated that material recovered as a result of what had been dreamt about could be deemed to be factually accurate, unless independent corroboration of events dreamt about could be adduced.

...

I do not consider that it is possible to state that material recovered as a result of dreams could be deemed to be true and accurate and if such is the only basis on which recollection is said to have occurred, while the evidence given may be accurate, there is no measure of assuring that such is the case."" (emphasis added)

51In his report of 30 August 2004 Dr Roberts stated that Miss C would have had to sleep for a minimum of 20 hours up to a maximum of 30 hours continuously to enable her to dream the entire sequence of events. He concluded that her evidence was ""medically, physiologically impossible"" and that what she asserted was the process by which she came to recall the events in the second statement could not have occurred. 

52Dr Roberts' oral evidence on the 2004 voir dire and at the 2007 trial was consistent with his reports. It is encapsulated by the following answer:

""I would say that in the absence of corroborative evidence, that any material that is based solely on recollections that [are recovered] as a result of dreams and nightmares in my view cannot be relied upon."" (emphasis added)

53At this stage I note two points about Dr Roberts' conclusions. First, Dr Roberts does not exclude the accuracy of a recollection derived from dreams but instead cautions about reliance on it in the absence of corroboration of the events so recalled. Dr Roberts did not expand upon what he meant by ""corroboration"" in this context.

54Second, Dr Roberts' conclusion is only concerned with memory for which the ""only basis"" for the recollection is dreams as opposed to, for example, the dreams being a trigger upon which other memory processes may then act. He appears to treat the situation as one whereby Miss C dreamt a series of events and her evidence simply constitutes her recounting the contents of her dreams and no more. This appears to involve a very literal reading of Miss C's evidence and makes no allowance for any inaccuracy or even imprecision in her ability to describe the mental processes by which she says that she came to a more accurate recollection of what occurred. This is illustrated by Dr Roberts' opinion that it was ""medically, physiologically impossible"" for Miss C to have slept long enough to have dreamt the entire sequence. If that opinion is accepted then from Bilal Skaf's perspective it proves too much in that it casts doubt on the very assumption that Dr Roberts is proceeding upon, namely that her second statement was based exclusively on her dreams.

55For the purposes of the voir dire and in response to Dr Roberts' report, the Crown retained Associate Professor Quadrio, a consultant psychiatrist. I was provided with a report from her dated 30 August 2004 (and another report dated 9 April 2007). Associate Professor Quadrio interviewed Miss C on 25 August 2004. Miss C told Associate Professor Quadrio that she had vivid dreams recalling the events of the assaults but also described having daytime ""flashes"" which are more ""like a snapshot rather than a video"" of the events. Associate Professor Quadrio considered that ""[t]o a large extent the process of Miss C remembering all the details of the assault over the following two to three weeks represents a normal process of recall"". In response to Dr Roberts she cited research indicating that that survivors of trauma including sexual assault may dream the event ""almost literally a few times and then gradually other elements are included as the event becomes woven into the rest of the person's life"".

56Associate Professor Quadrio gave evidence on the 2004 voir dire. Associate Professor Quadrio explained that the people subject to trauma quite commonly have vivid dreams concerning their experiences which are quite different to the dreams they normally experience:

""But flashbacks and reliving dreams are very common in trauma ... I would say that it is most likely that she has had a typical dream in a traumatic state which has actually been a vivid visual imagery of the trauma. And ... that is why she doesn't call it a dream, she ... calls [it] a dream flashback because [she is] aware qualitatively this is not like a dream she has had before. ... And her awareness, there is something particularly realistic about this is what gives [her] a sense this is more than just a dream. And she continues in her waking state having this imagery which is her visual recollection, if you like, of the trauma.""

57Associate Professor Quadrio cautioned about taking Miss C's description of the dream being like watching a video literally as Dr Roberts appears to have done:
""I think that, as is well documented, that memories [don't] function like a videotape although people will often say, especially if they have a very vivid dream, it is a very common sense expression for people to say, 'It was just like watching a video'. Usually what they mean by that is the detail, the vivid authenticity of it strikes them like a video.""

58Associate Professor Qaudrio's assessment was that notwithstanding Miss C's description of having a video-like dream or nightmare in fact what had occurred was a ""gradual process of recall"" as her state of shock began to subside. Thus she did not accept that Miss C's recollection was based exclusively or even wholly on a dream or nightmare:

""... I don't know [that it is] fair to say [that] the genesis of [Miss C's] memories are in her nightmares. She obviously has a tremendous amount of memory, memory of the traumatic assaults themselves. But there are problems with time sequence which is very typical of trauma and not all of the details are in her mind immediately. I would think that if one accepts that this is visual imagery of the trauma that it is by her becoming aware of those visual images that she recalls the further details, rather than the memory of the trauma ...""

59Associate Professor Quadrio's report from 2007 is to similar effect. 

60Associate Professor Quadrio did not give evidence during the 2007 retrial. However, at the 2007 trial the Crown called a Professor of Psychiatry from the University of New South Wales, Professor Bryant. He had prepared a report in 2000 addressing the effect on memory of traumatic events generally. He stated that it was very common after severe trauma for people to confuse the sequence of events ""especially in [the] acute phase in the few weeks after the assault"" and then as ""time progresses"" the sequence becomes ""more coherent and the person starts to understand the sequence better"". He also agreed (with Dr Roberts) that dreams were not an accurate source of recall and that material recovered from dreams could not be considered factually accurate unless corroborated.

Consideration - doubt about guilt

61The principal contention made on behalf of Bilal Skaf is that the expert evidence of Dr Roberts, which was explored in Mr Ghanem's retrial but not in his, is such as to raise a question as to his guilt. The Crown's response which I accept is that there was more than sufficient ""corroboration"" of the events depicted in the second statement to remove any concern that might otherwise be raised by Dr Roberts' evidence.

62Although a number of items of evidence were relied on by the Crown, I consider that the significant aspects are those which I have referred to at [29] to [35] above. In my view they overwhelmingly demonstrate the presence of Bilal Skaf at the Chullora industrial estate at the relevant time and at least some form of involvement on his part in the sexual assaults committed against Miss C. Bilal and Mohammed Skaf's phones were in use in the area of the Chullora estate at that time. The intercepted telephone calls are clearly incriminating. 

63Evidence of the commission of sexual assaults at an industrial estate first appeared in the second statement along with the existence of the person known as ""Adidas Sam"". Taking Miss C's evidence at its most literal these facts are said by Bilal Skaf to be the sole product of a dream or nightmare. Miss C later identified Bilal Skaf as ""Adidas Sam"". If her recollection, said to be based solely on a dream or a nightmare, is as unreliable as suggested then it could only be a fantastic coincidence that she could identify a person whose phone was in use at a nearby industrial estate on that very night at the relevant time, and who by his own admission played some role in the assaults committed upon her (""no way they can catch me""). The better explanation is that it is not a coincidence but that, after a passage of time following a traumatic event, her recollection however derived became generally accurate. 

64In the Mohammed Skaf application I identify a number of other aspects of Miss C's evidence incriminating him that only emerged in the second statement but which were strongly corroborated by independent evidence (Mohammed Skaf Application at [21] to [27]). This analysis demonstrates that there is further corroborative evidence of so much of Miss C's evidence as is said to have been derived from her ""dreams"". 

65In his submissions in reply Bilal Skaf sought to respond to this point as follows:

""The submissions of [the Attorney-General] focus on what is described as strong circumstantial and corroborative evidence against the applicant. Care must be taken with such a submission. ...[T]he case against the applicant was dependent on the evidence of the complainant. No amount of circumstantial evidence of the type relied upon by the respondent is capable of establishing the actual commission of particular offences."" 

66I take the reference in this submission to the ""actual commission of particular offences"" as referring to the precise details of the particular counts in the indictment. However this ignores the context in which this inquiry into the existence of ""corroborative"" evidence has arisen, namely the concerns raised by Dr Roberts' evidence. Dr Roberts did not elaborate upon the extent of the corroboration that he considered was necessary before a dream could be considered ""reliable"". However there is nothing to suggest that he was referring to corroboration in any technical sense much less as the kind that required independent evidence confirming all the minutia of the sexual assaults committed upon Miss C. In the second statement Miss C identified a new location at which she was assaulted and a new offender in the form of ""Adidas Sam"" (and others). As I have explained there is very strong independent evidence confirming both matters.

67In any event I accept Associate Professor Quadrio's analysis of the process by which Miss C in fact came to recall the events depicted in the second statement. In his submissions in reply Bilal Skaf contends that there was no issue between the parties that Miss C's second statement was ""based on her dreams"". If this is meant to suggest that it is common ground that Miss C's evidence was solely or exclusively based on her dreams then it is incorrect. The footnote to this submission cross-references an extract from the Attorney-General's submissions referring to Associate Professor Quadrio's evidence. As I have explained Associate Professor Quadrio did not accept that Miss C's evidence was solely based on dreams and nightmares but instead referred to them as part of a more complex but not unusual process by which trauma sufferers recall events. 

68I have referred in [50] and [52] above to the opinion of Dr Roberts as being predicated on Miss C's dreams or nightmares being the ""only basis on which recollection is said to have occurred"". Properly analysed this was an assumption upon which Dr Roberts proceeded which appears to have been based upon a literal reading of Miss C's evidence. Dr Roberts did not confer with Miss C. Nor did he revisit this assumption either upon receiving Associate Professor Quadrio's reports or any transcript of her evidence. As I have stated Dr Roberts' own opinion that it was ""medically, physiologically impossible"" for Miss C to have slept long enough to have dreamt the entire sequence tended to invalidate his assumption that the version of events in her second statement was based exclusively on her dreams. Instead, as suggested by Associate Professor Quadrio, Dr Roberts' observation in his second report demonstrates the need for caution in treating Miss C's description of her process of recall in her evidence too literally. It either suggests that her revised recollection arose from the type of process referred to by Associate Professor Quadrio, or that Miss C completely fabricated either her evidence or her explanation for the process that led to her reconsidering her evidence. No party at any trial suggested the latter to be the case. 

69The submissions on behalf of Bilal Skaf sought to draw support from cases suggesting that evidence induced by hypnosis or treatments such as EMDR (eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing) should be treated as prima facie inadmissible or otherwise treated with caution (eg R v Tillott (1995) 38 NSWLR 1 at 39 to 40 per Abadee J; R v McFelin [1985] 2 NZLR 750 and R v Jenkyns (1993) 32 NSWLR 712 at 714 per Hunt CJ at CL). Those cases involved the application of a form of therapy to induce or isolate memories. This case involves the victim of trauma obtaining a fuller recollection of the events in the weeks after the incident without the intervention of any form of treatment. The cases relied on do not assist. Reliance was also placed on various authorities dealing with so called ""revived memory"", including R v Eishauer (1997) 96 A Crim R 489 in which Sperling and Smart JJ (Simpson J dissenting) overturned a conviction based on a memory that was forgotten but revived after eight years. None of the cases referred to establish any general principle of assistance in this matter. They generally deal with memories of (alleged) entire incidents which are long suppressed and then revived. They are far removed from the facts of this case. 

70It was not expressly submitted on behalf of Bilal Skaf that the acquittal of Mr Ghanem at his retrial which had the benefit of Dr Roberts' evidence supported his application. However for the sake of completeness I note that the acquittal of Mr Ghanem is explicable on a number of bases that do not cast doubt on Bilal Skaf's guilt. I note two matters. First, as I have stated, at the 2007 retrial Miss C did not give oral evidence and instead the jury were read the transcript of her evidence from the 2002 trial. Thus the jury were deprived of the ability to consider Dr Roberts' analysis in light of their assessment of Miss C as a witness. Second, there was significantly less independent evidence pointing to the involvement of Mr Ghanem in the sexual assaults upon Miss C than there was against Bilal Skaf and Mohammed Skaf (see 2004 Conviction Appeal at [87] to [92]). There were no incriminating telephone calls. There were only limited records of his phone being used and none of those records placed him in the area of the Chullora industrial estate (2004 Conviction Appeal at [117]).

71Dr Roberts' evidence does not cause me to have any sense of disquiet or unease about Bilal Skaf's guilt, nor does it give rise to a doubt or unresolved question about the evidence demonstrating his guilt.

Consideration - Jury Directions

72Bilal Skaf accepts that the trial judge made a number of directions which drew attention to the difficulties with Miss C's evidence including her inconsistent versions of events both to friends and the police including the first and second statement. The trial judge also gave the jury the standard directions concerning identification evidence. 

73However Bilal Skaf complains that no specific warning was given in respect of her process of recollecting the events described in the second statement and that no direction was given to the jury in respect of the ""dangers of relying upon the evidence of the complaint that she stated was derived from memories based on dreams or flashbacks"".

74I have described the evidence that Miss C gave at the 2002 trial concerning this at [43] to [44]. No direction of the kind now contended for was sought at the trial. No complaint was made about it on appeal. The Court of Criminal Appeal referred to this aspect of Miss C's evidence and the changes between the first and second statements and noted that she was cross-examined ""vigorously"" (2004 Conviction Appeal at [259]).

75Bilal Skaf's response to the absence of any request for such a direction is that the necessity for the direction only arose once Dr Roberts' evidence was available. Presumably it is said that, in the absence of having that evidence, his Counsel could not have appreciated the significance of the evidence given by Miss C.

76For the reasons next set out I do not consider that there was any relevant breach of an obligation to disclose by either the prosecution or the police prior to the 2002 trial in relation to any matter concerning Miss C's process of recollection. Thus there was no failure of process prior to the 2002 trial which resulted in Bilal Skaf being denied the ability to obtain expert evidence of the kind later given by Dr Roberts. Further, even if Dr Roberts' evidence was available at the 2002 trial I do not consider that any direction to the effect contended for would have been required to have been given by the trial judge. At most the trial judge would have simply summarised the competing evidence of the experts and left it to the jury to determine. 

77The suggested direction was not sought and I do not consider that it was necessary. Its absence does not cause me to have any sense of unease or disquiet concerning Bilal Skaf's conviction or guilt. 

Consideration - Failure to Disclose

78Bilal Skaf also alleges that there was a breach of the prosecutorial duty of disclosure by reason of the failure to reveal to him or his legal representatives prior to the 2002 trial that the events described in the second statement were derived from dreams or nightmares. 

79At the 2002 trial and after Miss C had given the evidence referred to above concerning the process by which she recalled the events recorded in her second statement, Senior Constable Brazel was called to give evidence. Senior Constable Brazel had taken the first and second statements from Miss C. She stated that she saw Miss C on 14 September 2000 and Miss C told her that:
""... she had been through [the first statement] and that she had been confused as to some of the sequence that some of the things happened and in the order in which they happened"".

80Senior Constable Brazel took some notes on that day and arranged to interview Miss C on 21 September 2000. On that day she took a further statement (the second statement). In cross examination by counsel for Bilal Skaf, Senior Constable Brazel was asked (T546.15):

""Q. And did she tell you that she had had flashbacks or use that term in any conversation she had with you on 14 September; that is, flashbacks as to what she was alleging had occurred to her on 30 August?
A. I don't recall her referring to them as flashbacks, but she certainly indicated to me that her first statement wasn't accurate."" (emphasis added)

81At the time these questions were asked it had been two days since Miss C had referred to the events coming to her while she was asleep (ie ""flashbacks"" while sleeping). Counsel for Bilal Skaf did not follow up with Senior Constable Brazel what she meant by ""them"" in this answer, or seek to clarify whether Miss C told Senior Constable Brazel anything to the effect that the events had come to her while she was asleep. 

82Senior Constable Brazel was called to give evidence at the 2007 retrial of Mr Ghanem. She was again cross-examined on the differences between the first and second statements and the process by which the second statement came to be drafted and signed. A reading of the transcript confirms that her recollection of events was relatively poor and she had not reviewed much material before giving evidence. Senior Constable Brazel was asked as follows:

""Q. ... did she tell you how those changes, yes or no, how those changes occurred to her?
A. Yes she did.

Q. Did she tell you she had had nightmares?
A. Yes she had.

Q. She did tell you that, did she?
A. She did tell me it came to her in a dream.

Q. In a dream?
A. Yes.""

83The Attorney-General submits that this evidence of Senior Constable Brazel is inconsistent with the evidence she gave at the 2002 trial set out at [80] above and that due to the passage of time I should accept the evidence from the 2002 trial. I do not consider there to be any inconsistency. All that Senior Constable Brazel stated at the 2002 trial, set out in the extract above at [80], is that Miss C did not use the term ""flashbacks"" on 14 September 2000. That evidence is not inconsistent with Senior Constable Brazel's statement in 2007 that Miss C had told her that the events ""came to her in a dream"". It seems most likely that it was the dream(s) that Senior Constable Brazel was referring to when she used the word ""them"" in answer to the question at the 2002 trial that I have extracted above (at [80]).

84However all that is known is that Miss C told Senior Constable Brazel that the new sequence of events had come to her in a dream. There is nothing to suggest that prior to the 2002 trial Senior Constable Brazel questioned Miss C as to the significance of the dreams, how many, or whether there was any other memory trigger. Further there is nothing to suggest that Senior Constable Brazel attached any significance to the disclosure made by Miss C to her that the events had come to her in a dream. At the 2002 trial Miss C explained how she had recollected the events the subject of her second statement, and that explanation was heard by all counsel appearing, most if not all of whom were very experienced. No application of any kind was made by those counsel as a consequence at that point or any subsequent time in the trial. The question set out at [80] above was the only question asked of Senior Constable Brazel on this topic. If experienced counsel heard Miss C's references to recalling events while asleep and did not attribute any significance to it why should it be expected that Senior Constable Brazel considered it important, or even relevant, when Miss C told her that on 14 September 2000? 

85Bilal Skaf's submissions refer to a number of authorities concerning the prosecution's duty to disclose exculpatory material including matters affecting the credit of prosecution witnesses (citing Mallard v R [2005] HCA 68; 224 CLR 125 at [83] per Kirby J; and Grey v R [2001] HCA 65; 75 ALJR 1708). He appears to accept that there is nothing to suggest that the Crown Prosecutor was aware of Miss C's process of recalling the events in the second statement, but it is contended that material within the knowledge of an investigating detective is sufficient to engage an obligation of disclosure (citing Subramaniam v The Queen [2004] HCA 51; 79 ALJR 116 at [54], and clause 18 of the Director of Public Prosecutions Guidelines, see now s 15A of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986).

86It follows from the above that I accept that Senior Constable Brazel was aware prior to the 2002 trial that Miss C had stated that the events described in the second statement had come to her in a dream. However I do not accept that Senior Constable Brazel was aware that that disclosure was potentially exculpatory or that she should have been aware that it was exculpatory. The potential significance of this ""revelation"" was only apparent upon Dr Roberts' evidence becoming available and, in any event, his evidence only has an exculpatory quality because it construes Miss C's evidence of her own mental processes too literally. The question of whether the failure of the prosecution to disclose some matter disclosed to it by the complainant amounts to a failure to comply with its duty to disclose exculpatory material involves an assessment of the nature of the material and whether it could reasonably be perceived to bear upon the credibility of Miss C ""on a sensible appraisal by the prosecution"" (R v Reardon (No 2) [2004] NSWCCA 197; 60 NSWLR 454 at [48] per Hodgson JA). I am not satisfied that there was any such failure here. Had this material been of that character I would have expected that immediate complaint would have been made at the 2002 trial and Senior Constable Brazel would have been pressed much further on the disclosures made to her by Miss C as to how she came to recall the events. That did not occur.

87The absence of any disclosure of the statement made by Miss C to Detective Brazel that the events described in the second statement had come to her in a dream does not cause me to have a sense of unease or disquiet concerning Bilal Skaf's guilt. It does not raise a doubt or question as to his guilt.

Conclusion

88None of the matters relied on raise a doubt or question as to Bilal Skaf's guilt. Nor do they give rise to a doubt or question about the evidence demonstrating his guilt.

89I refuse the application.

		19 April 2013",2013-03-11 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2707057,R v Karimi; R v Khoury; R v Mir (No. 2) [2013] NSWSC 199,"Judgment (ON APPLICATION FOR DISCHARGE OF JUROR AND BALANCE OF JURy)

1JOHNSON J: A jury has been empanelled today for the purpose of the trial of the three Accused, John Khoury, Mohammed Jawad Karimi and Mahdi Mir, upon a number of charges, including murder. 

2The empanelment process was exhaustive, and occupied the better part of the morning. A jury was empanelled soon after noon, and I commenced my introductory comments to them, after a customary adjournment. 

3Shortly before 1.00 pm, it was drawn to my Associate's attention by Mr Radojev, counsel for Mr Khoury, that his instructing solicitor, Elias Tabchouri, recognised a member of the jury. 

4The Court has been informed that Mr Tabchouri was not present in Court, during the processes whereby the jury was empanelled. The nature of the association between Mr Tabchouri and the juror was indicated to the Court by Mr Radojev before the lunch break. The Court was informed that Mr Tabchouri and the juror had served on a church committee together and had some association in that respect. 

5Immediately before adjourning for lunch, the Court was informed by one of the Court officers that the juror had commented that he recognised a legal practitioner in Court. 

6The present trial has barely commenced. The jury has been empanelled. I am still in the process of making introductory comments to the jury. The Crown has not commenced any opening address. 

7The trial has an eight-week estimate. 

8Section 53B(b) Jury Act 1977 provides that the Court may, in the course of any trial, discharge a juror if it appears to the Court, from the juror's own statements or from evidence before the Court, that the juror may not be able to give impartial consideration to the case because of (relevantly) the juror's familiarity with the legal representatives in the trial or any reasonable apprehension of bias or conflict of interest on the part of the juror. 

9The section, although somewhat awkwardly expressed, appears to involve the reasonable apprehension of bias test as laid down by the High Court of Australia in Webb v The Queen [1994] HCA 30; 181 CLR 41. 

10What the provision does indicate is that the appearance to the Court of these matters should emerge from the juror's own statements or from evidence before the Court. Because of that statutory formula, I formed the view that the juror in question should give evidence on this issue. The juror was called and gave evidence in open Court, although in the absence of the remaining 11 members of the jury. 

11The juror gave what I considered to be frank and direct evidence of his knowledge and association and, indeed, friendship with Mr Tabchouri through a church committee and occasional contact in that context. The juror expressed the view that he would be able to give impartial consideration to the issues in the case. He did indicate, at one point, that there may be the potential for some awkwardness because of future contact with Mr Tabchouri, no doubt in the context of possible verdicts that may be returned. 

12Mr Wasilenia, counsel for the Accused Karimi, has sought that the juror be discharged and that, thereafter, the balance of the jury be discharged, given that the trial has barely commenced. He has submitted that there is a concern with respect to the impartiality of the juror's deliberations or, at least, any appearance of that in the circumstances. 

13Mr Stewart, counsel for the Accused Mir, has joined in the application. He has emphasised, amongst other things, the appearance to the reasonable bystander if this two-month jury trial proceeds with a member of the jury being someone who could be described as a friend of a legal representative for one of the Accused. 

14Mr Stewart developed further submissions in support of the discharge application. He also submitted that, if the juror was discharged, then the entire jury should be discharged. 

15Mr Radojev did not join in the discharge application with respect to the individual juror, but submitted that, if that juror was discharged, the balance of the jury should be discharged as well. 

16The Crown did not apply for discharge of the juror, although acknowledging the force of some of the matters which had been advanced in particular by Mr Stewart. 

17As s.53B makes clear, the question for the Court is a discretionary one. The test contained in section 53B(b) of the Act is not one that is answered by the juror's response that he considers that he can be impartial. That is an important first step, but it is not decisive. 

18This trial will extend for two months with, no doubt, demanding phases. An existing relationship between a juror and a legal representative of an accused person may potentially surface in the mind of the juror during the course of the trial, despite the best intention of the juror in question. 

19It is regrettable, to say the least, that Mr Tabchouri was not in Court when the jury was empanelled. This problem could have been entirely avoided by his presence, which could have led to an application by the juror to be excused or the adoption of a course without any of the Accused or the Crown utilising a challenge. However, the Court must deal with the present state of affairs. 

20The relationship between the juror and Mr Tabchouri cannot be characterised as a remote and passing association. It is one that clearly involved friendship and what the juror, as I have said, still characterises as friendship. 

21An important aspect, in my view, is the public's perception that justice must not only be done, but must be seen to be done. The test is one of reasonable apprehension of bias, involving a reasonable bystander considering the state of affairs in question. It is an objective test: Webb v The Queen at 53; R v Pearson [2000] NSWCCA 149; 114 A Crim R 80 at 87 [31]-[32]. The reasonable apprehension of bias test is not answered by the juror saying, ""I will be impartial"", any more than it would be answered if a Judge said that alone. 

22I have regard to the point that has been reached in the trial. I am satisfied that a proper basis has been demonstrated, from the juror's own statements or from evidence before the Court, warranting the discharge of the individual juror and I will make that order in due course. 

23It is open to the Court to consider proceeding with this trial with a jury of 11. However, this is a trial with a two-month estimate that has barely started. Events may occur during the trial which impact upon the constitution of the jury. Further, as has been submitted, the community and the Accused are entitled to at least commence a trial with a jury of 12. Technically, that has happened in this case, but it is a bare technicality, given the point that has been reached. 

24It seems to me that the appropriate course is to discharge the balance of the jury. That will mean that the trial will have to recommence. I will, in due course, fix the trial to commence next Monday. 

25A subsidiary question which has arisen is whether the 11 remaining jurors may form part of the panel to be assembled next Monday. 

26It has been submitted by Mr Wasilenia and Mr Stewart that that should not happen. The evidence of the individual juror is that he had revealed to the balance of the jury the fact that he knew a legal practitioner involved in the trial, and that there was some speculation as to what impact that may have on the future of that juror in the trial. That is what the evidence points to as being the extent of discussion so far. 

27When the juror was stood down, after examination in Court, he was asked not to discuss with the balance of the jury what had happened in Court. I regard the juror as being an honest and reliable person who would comply with that request. 

28Beyond that, the 11 members of the jury have heard no more about this trial than any panel or jury which may be empanelled next Monday - the Crown summary of the nature of the charges, the list of witnesses and some bare introductory comments from me. 

29I am informed that the jury panel available for next Monday is in the order of 37 persons. Whether 37 persons attend, or whether some persons make application to the Sheriff to be excused between now and then, is a matter of conjecture. 

30At this point, I am not persuaded that there is an impediment to the 11 remaining jurors being available as part of the panel next Monday. I will, as part of the process of discharging them, indicate that that may well be what occurs. With that in mind, I will request those persons to refrain from discussing the issues in the trial with any person between now and then. 

31Whether any of those 11 persons happen to be called (in the sense of having their numbers called) next Monday, is a matter for the future. If they are, and if some further application is made, I will consider the matter at that time. 

32However, I am not persuaded that an in principle decision should be made today that those 11 jurors should, effectively, be put to one side.

[Orders made discharging the juror and then discharging the 11 remaining members of the jury]

2707058,R v Feili [2013] NSWSC 492,"Judgment
1This trial is now in its fifth week following empanelment of the jury, or seventh week if one were to count pre-trial hearings.  There are currently 12 accused.
A question of fitness to be tried
2Last Thursday, 7 March 2013, Mr Flynn, counsel for the accused Feili, raised a question as to the fitness of his client to be tried.  Having heard him outline his concerns I was satisfied that the question had been raised in good faith.
3The basis upon which it is thought that Mr Feili is not fit to be tried is quite unusual; he is sleeping at times during the trial.
4Section 10 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW) requires that once a question of fitness to be tried is raised in good faith after a person has been arraigned, a court must, as soon as practicable, conduct an inquiry in order to determine whether the person is unfit to be tried.  Accordingly, the jury were sent away and I embarked upon an inquiry. 5At the conclusion of the inquiry on Tuesday 12 March 2013 I announced my determination that Mr Feili was fit to be tried.  The following are my reasons.
Evidence of Dr Stephen Allnutt
6Dr Stephen Allnutt, forensic psychiatrist, was called on 7 March 2013 to give evidence on Mr Feili's behalf.  He had seen Mr Feili on 22 January 2013 and diagnosed him as suffering from depression.  He saw him again on 11 February 2013 and assessed him as being fit to be tried.  However, when he saw him again last Thursday he came to the view that ""on balance the reasonable position ... to take is that he's probably unfit to stand trial"" (T1051.22).  I will quote from his evidence to avoid any paraphrase that might put an inappropriate gloss on his opinion:
Q.  That's the conclusion, so now we'll perhaps lead on.  Could you tell his Honour what factors have led you to form that view? A.  Firstly, he has a depressive disorder that has been evident since at least when I saw him. 
Q.  That is when you first saw him? A.  Correct. 
Q.  Continue.  A.  I would formulate that the context that he is in at the moment has been acting as a significant stressor for him.  What he's complaining of are three problems:  insomnia, concentration difficulties and fatigue and motivation problems which probably go together.  Insomnia, difficulties with concentration, fatigue are common symptoms of depression.  He is, I think - he has, I think, found the hearings to be stressful and upsetting emotionally and what happens is when he returns back to Villawood for the night he becomes preoccupied and ruminative of the hearings.  He's vulnerable to that due to his depression.  As a consequence of his ruminations and anxieties he doesn't sleep and he's vulnerable to not sleeping purely because he has depression in the first place, so insomnia is a symptom of depression, so he becomes ruminative, unable to sleep at night, wakes up in the morning unrested, fatigued and, in the context of the hearing, he's unable to maintain his focus and concentration and so falls asleep.  So essentially he's not following proceedings as a consequence.
To some degree one might say that there is an element of voluntariness to it.  It's upsetting for him and he sometimes doesn't want to focus and be there, and in the absence of depression, one might draw that conclusion, but I think given that he's got a depressive disorder, and is experiencing symptoms of depression, that makes - provides an involuntary component to the problem.  And on balance I think it would be reasonable to conclude on that basis that he's unfit to stand trial because of his depression and because he cannot follow proceedings.  That then impacts on the quality of his interaction with his counsel.
There's a further problem that has been communicated to me by his counsel that he seems not to remember from day to day what was discussed the day before.  That's not an uncommon complaint in people who have significant depression because one of the symptoms of depression is concentration problems.
So on balance I think the reasonable conclusion is he's unfit to stand trial basically because he fails on the issue outlined in Kesavarajah rather than Presser.  
Q.  Doctor, there has been a change from the time that you saw him on 11 February to today's date as outlined by you, correct?  In the sense that he was assessed by you at one stage to be fit for trial and now unfit for trial? A.  Yes.  He described to me that he feels he's deteriorated as the trial has continued.  At the time that I saw him, I suppose there was no clear - I mean, while he had complained of concentration problems and he did have insomnia, many people come before the Court with depression because they are in front of the Court often and are still fit.  So at that stage, in a sense, his capacity to follow proceedings appeared to be adequate.  It's in the context of the trial that it's been tested and it doesn't seem to be the case. 
Q.  That was the point I was moving to.  The trial itself has caused more symptoms which have led you to conclude that he is now unfit for trial? A.  Yes.  I think it's fair to say that the trial is a stress for him and aggravates symptoms for him. (T1051.25-1052.33)
7Dr Allnutt understood the position to be that Mr Feili had not received any treatment for his depressive disorder and was not prescribed any medication for it.  He was taking some sleep medication but claimed that it did not work (T1053.4).  If he were to commence on a course of antidepressant medication, one would expect to see some response over a period of two weeks and a reasonable response by four weeks (T1060.15).
8In cross-examination the Crown Prosecutor asked of the prospect that Mr Feili was taking the antidepressant medication Avanza.  Dr Allnutt was not informed of this as part of the history given by Mr Feili.  He said people often confused sleep medication, which Mr Feili said he was taking, with antidepressant medication.  Significantly, however, he added that Avanza has the effect of causing drowsiness (T1062.20).  By the conclusion of the inquiry, however, there was no evidence placed before me as to precisely what medication Mr Feili has been taking.
9Dr Allnutt was asked whether it was possible that Mr Feili was feigning his symptoms.  The evidence on this aspect included the following:
Q.  So as to whether he is asleep or not is a matter of fact that has to be determined? A.  Correct. 
Q.  If he's feigning or not being completely honest as to what is happening during the course of the trial during the day-to-day proceedings, that would change your opinion? A.  Yes.  Well, if he's not, in fact, sleeping, that would, I suppose, diminish the likelihood. 
Q.  That he's unfit? A.  That he's unfit because it predominantly rests on him not following proceedings.  There are other aspects that may be impacting which is poor concentration, but if he is, in fact, feigning sleep then that does, I suppose, jade that argument. (T1062.45-1063.3) 
10An aspect that was raised by Mr Flynn as a matter relevant to his client's fitness to be tried was that there were difficulties in communicating with Mr Feili in that he did not seem to recall what was said from one conference to the next.  The point was not really developed.  It seems to me that the simple solution would be for Mr Feili to be reminded of what had been previously discussed.
Evidence of Dr Bruce Westmore
11The Crown engaged Dr Bruce Westmore, forensic psychiatrist, to see Mr Feili on Saturday and to provide a report.  Dr Westmore was called on Monday 11 March 2011 to give evidence and his report became Exhibit A on the inquiry.
12Dr Westmore took a relatively lengthy history from Mr Feili and made a provisional diagnosis that he was suffering from a chronic Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood.  A differential diagnosis would include Dysthymic Disorder or a Major Depressive Disorder.  
13Dr Westmore's ultimate conclusion was that ""Mr Feili is fit to be tried if he can remain awake"".  His report includes the following:
Despite his depression, I did not think he was cognitively impaired in any significant way (because of his depression) which might compromise his fitness.  He does not have evidence of an organic disturbance and he is not psychotic.  His history is that he is chronically tired and has major problems sleeping.  While psychiatrists have no expertise in truthfulness, I think his overall affect and demeanour were consistent with the history he gave in relation to his state of tiredness.  He was not a dramatic or histrionic historian, more fatigued, reserved and a little withdrawn.
He could however indicate quite clearly and consistently that he did want the legal matters to proceed to their conclusion.
Mr Feili is likely to be falling asleep in court in part because he is tired, but also because he is disinterested in the outcome, or at least he has been to date.  His position is that nothing much else can be done to him now.  His application to remain in Australia has been rejected, he is uncertain about the welfare of his family and he has had 2 heart attacks and he is worried about possibly having a 3rd heart attack.
His sleep hygiene appears to be problematic, but that might be corrected with appropriate medical management.  In the court setting he might be assisted by having an individual interpreter whose job would be not only to ensure that he understands what is said and what is happening in court, but also to ensure that he remains awake.  The court may also be able to make some allowances for Mr Feili by giving him some regular breaks during the proceedings.
14Dr Westmore's account of his conversation with Mr Feili included that he asked, ""what must I do?""  Dr Westmore told him that he would need to stay awake in court and that if he continued to experience such problems the process might be even more protracted than it currently was.  Mr Feili indicated that he understood and said, ""Yes, I will do my best to be awake in court"".  He also said that he wanted the case to be finalised.
15One suggestion to deal with the problem of Mr Feili falling asleep in court was to have somebody keep an eye on him and give him a gentle prod or tap when necessary.  Dr Westmore was asked whether even if Mr Feili appeared to be awake that it would necessarily follow that he was aware of what was happening within the courtroom.  He said there was no psychiatric reason why that should not be the case.  It was possible that Mr Feili might appear to be awake but not following the proceedings, that is, not attending and concentrating, but that was not caused by his depression. (T1069.20)
16The way to determine whether Mr Feili was awake but not attending or concentrating on the proceedings would be for his lawyers to discuss what had been occurring and to gauge what he appears to have comprehended (T1069.45).  Mr Flynn indicated that this might be something that would have to be done on an ongoing basis.  Dr Westmore replied, ""if it is an ongoing problem, it is not arising primarily from a psychiatric reason"". (T1070.10)
17Mr Flynn then asked a question that appears to have misunderstood Dr Westmore's opinion, but Dr Westmore reiterated:
Depression can impact in the way we've been discussing but I do not believe he is so depressed that he doesn't have the ability or the capacity to attend and concentrate (T1070.16).
Further evidence by Dr Allnutt
18Dr Allnutt was re-called to give evidence in response to that of Dr Westmore. Before he gave that evidence I was informed by the Crown Prosecutor: Mr Flynn's client was seen by a different psychiatrist on Sunday and his medication has been changed.  Last night or yesterday afternoon he was unable to be seen by a general practitioner but was seen by a nurse from the IHMS service who was instructed to give him some counselling, as it were, in relation to sleep hygiene.  I understand that took place.  
The reports from the late mail is that he was asleep [last night] by 10.40pm and woke up at 6.50am. (T1079-1080) 19Dr Allnutt said the following in his further evidence in chief: Q.  Having read the report and read the evidence of Dr Westmore, is there anything in that material that causes you to change any view that you expressed when you were last giving your evidence? 
A.  No, not substantially.  The way that I see it is that the issue here is his insomnia.  That was my view the last time I gave evidence.  I suppose the only thing that I would suggest is I would agree if one can treat the insomnia then one treats the fitness issue.  But if there is insomnia, I think it becomes a matter for the court to determine, on a matter of fact, whether or not he does have insomnia and whether or not he does in fact fall asleep during the proceedings.  
If he does in fact have insomnia and does in fact have difficulty falling asleep through the proceedings then I think in fact Dr Westmore would even agree with me if I asked him to think back on his days as a medical student and being up all night on call and being expected to attend lectures the next day and the difficulty one would have in concentrating and focusing and the desire to sleep that one would experience.  So it boils down to the issue of insomnia.  
If that issue can be solved, and I just heard some anecdotal evidence today that it might be solved, then I think on balance one might fall in favour of fitness.  If that issue can't be solved then I think - and it is factually determined that he has insomnia and it is factually determined that he is sleeping during the proceedings, then it is obvious, I think it stands to reason then, that he is unfit to stand trial because he is falling asleep.  
I have looked at the options of having somebody nudging him.  Something even more helpful might be holding his eyes open for him.  The thing is that somebody nudging him doesn't mean, if he is truly sleepy and tired, somebody nudging him awake to me implies that there are intermittent periods when he is not following proceedings and on balance you will have to find he is unfit.  So I think Dr Westmore and I agree in all areas if insomnia is determined as a factual issue here.  (T1081)
20The following evidence given at the conclusion of Dr Allnutt's further evidence is of importance: Q.  Doctor, can I just clarify something with you.  Going back to Presser and Kesavarajah I want to be absolutely clear what is the basis for your opinion that he is unfit.  Is it because he does not have the capacity to follow the course of the proceedings so as to understand what is going on in court in a general sense and/or he doesn't have the ability to understand the substantial effect of any evidence that may be given against him?  They are two Presser criteria that seem to be what you are concerned with but I would like to hear it from you? 
A.  I think yes, I think it goes to those two.  I think - look, it depends on what the thresholds are here and that again sometimes varies from court to court.  People apply different thresholds depending on the duration of the trial, depending on the nature of the evidence that's required.  So that's got to be taken into consideration as well.  
I suppose how important, and an issue has been brought up about that, how important it is that he hears all the evidence, but in particular the evidence that pertains to him; that he actually hears and takes in what each witness is saying about him in particular, whether that is happening. 
Q.  But he is not doing that in a direct sense? 
A.  If he's not doing that then-- 
Q.  If that man reading off a computer screen in the dock is not there he wouldn't have a clue what was being said.  He wouldn't be able to follow the evidence at all.  So we take the step of providing an interpreter so that the evidence can be relayed to him.  He is getting it secondhand though.  Similarly, if my understanding of the law is correct, Presser does not require an accused to be able to hear first-hand and understand every single word that is uttered in a criminal trial but they have to have an ability to generally follow the course of the proceedings and generally to understand the substantial effect of the evidence.  Now, given there is one example of him not hearing any of the evidence first-hand is another example that might be considered, the fact that he can have any of the evidence that he has missed himself repeated to him.  We have a daily transcript, we have lawyers keeping notes; if his lawyers, in conference, become aware that he has missed something they can tell him exactly what was said.  So he does have that ability, second-hand albeit, to be able to follow the evidence and to understand the substantial effect of it.  
A.  Yes, I would accept that. 
Q.  So if that is borne in mind he must be found to be fit, mustn't he? 
A.  If that's the test then he must be found to be fit as long as he - as long as - yes, if he can take the information in afterwards in a meeting with his counsel then - and the test is a general understanding of proceedings and, as I say, that has - that varies, but if that's the test then on balance he probably would be regarded as fit if in meeting with his counsel afterwards he is able to take that information in and communicate with his counsel in relation to that during that meeting.  
The issue though is there may be evidence that is provided that is crucial that may be, for him, has special importance and he may miss it, but that's another side of the spectrum.  It depends where - again it is a threshold - it depends on how broad - where one draws the line upon that spectrum. 
Q.  The question is not so much whether he has a reduced capacity to follow the course of the proceedings to understand what's going on in court in a general sense and understands the substantial effect of the evidence.  A reduced capacity doesn't mean a person is unfit.  It is a question of whether the person is denied that capacity and the authority for that is The Queen v Rivkin, a 2004 case.  So it is a question here as to whether he is denied the capacity and, bearing in mind steps that can be taken for him to be acquainted with the evidence with the assistance of his lawyers, I wonder whether it truly can be said that he is denied those capacities? 
A.  If he could be provided with that information by the lawyers and not miss crucial information and that - and he takes that information in from his lawyers, then I suppose, on balance, it would meet that test.
Determination
21It has been my observation at various stages of the trial that Mr Feili has appeared to be asleep.  Up until Mr Flynn raised his concerns last Thursday, I simply assumed that this was out of boredom or disinterest.  
22I accept that there is a possibility that Mr Feili has been falling asleep as a result of fatigue, or being chronically tired as a result of not getting sufficient sleep at night.  Dr Allnutt spoke of insomnia being a result of the depressive disorder from which Mr Feili suffers.  Dr Westmore does not appear to take issue with that.  I accept that evidence.
23I accept also that a contributing cause may well be that Mr Feili is either bored or disinterested, or, as Dr Allnutt put it, he finds it ""upsetting to him and he sometimes doesn't want to focus and be there"" (T1051.50).  For a lot of the time during the trial there are matters being discussed that do not have any direct relevance to Mr Feili, aside from the issue as to whether there was a common purpose of those involved in the disturbance at the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre that is the subject of the charges.  There is nothing before me that would indicate he has been asleep when matters of importance to his case were the subject matter.  Even if that was the case, there is nothing to indicate that it has not been possible for Mr Feili to be kept apprised by his lawyers of what has been said of relevance to him.  The court reporters are providing both a real-time and daily transcript service.  No attempt was made to place any evidence before me to the effect that Mr Feili has missed something that is ""crucial"" to the case against him, or to his defence.
24Dr Westmore spoke of a number of steps that could be taken to overcome the consequential problem of Mr Feili falling asleep in court.  Having somebody sitting in the dock monitoring him and attracting his attention if he looked drowsy was one.  Having his general sleeping arrangements, or ""sleep hygiene"" as Dr Westmore called it, reviewed was another.  Further, consideration by a general practitioner to prescribing appropriate medication might assist.  It seemed from what the Crown Prosecutor told me just before the further evidence of Dr Allnutt on Tuesday 12 March 2013 that some steps have been taken.  Whether they will have any ameliorative effect remains to be seen.
25According to Dr Westmore, Mr Feili is motivated to see the trial proceed to conclusion.  Neither doctor saw anything that would give rise to concern that he was not genuine in this respect.  
26Both Dr Allnutt and Dr Westmore are of the view that if Mr Feili is sleeping through periods of the trial then he is unfit to be tried.  The converse, obviously, is that if he is not sleeping through periods of the trial he is not unfit.  If Mr Feili makes a concerted effort to stay awake, perhaps aided by the various measures alluded to above, and is successful, then a conclusion that he is unfit is not justified.
27I must say, however, that I am not entirely convinced that a person can be unfit to be tried on account of the person sleeping at times during their trial.
28Fitness to be tried is assessed by application of the criteria referred to by Smith J in R v Presser [1958] VR 45 at 48.  Dr Allnutt said in the passage from his evidence extracted above (at [6]) that Mr Feili was ""unfit to stand trial ... because he fails on the issue outlined in Kesavarajah rather than Presser"".  This view was not fully developed in submissions or evidence.  But I understand it to be a reference to considering fitness in the light of the expected duration of the trial, especially where the issue is manifested in a psychiatric condition that may become more florid in response to the stressors of the proceeding.  I am satisfied that, unless it proves otherwise, the ameliorative measures outlined at [24] are an appropriate response to managing the symptoms of sleeplessness for the duration of the trial.
29There is no specific reference in the Presser criteria (nor in Kesavarajah v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 230 for that matter) to being able to stay awake and listen to every single word uttered during the entirety of the trial.  The closest any of the Presser criteria comes to being relevant to the present situation, at 48, is:
He needs to be able to follow the course of the proceedings so as to understand what is going on in court in a general sense, though he need not, of course, understand the purpose of all of the various court formalities.  He needs to be able to understand ... the substantial effect of any evidence that may be given against him ...
30Dr Allnutt confirmed that these were the aspects that gave rise to his opinion as to unfitness (see above at [20]). 31In Clarkson v R [2007] NSWCCA 70, Beazley JA (as her Honour then was) reviewed extensively the law relating to the issue of an accused being fit or unfit to be tried.  Whilst it was accepted that the Presser criteria has long been the understanding in the common law of the measures by which fitness to be tried was to be assessed, her Honour's review of authority included the following statements of the general concept: [130] In Ngatayi v The Queen (1980) 147 CLR 1 Gibbs, Mason and Wilson JJ observed that legislation governing ""fitness to be tried"" had always been interpreted as to raise the question ""whether the prisoner has sufficient understanding to comprehend the nature of this trial, so as to make a proper defence to the charge"": see R v Pritchard (1836) 173 ER 135 per Alderson B.
...
[132] Their Honours, at 8, said that the test ""looks to the capacity of the accused to understand the proceedings"", but pointed out that complete understanding was not necessary. Their Honours agreed with the approach taken by Smith J in Presser that the test needs to be applied ""in a reasonable and commonsense fashion"". Their Honours essentially endorsed the statement of Smith J as to the minimum capacity an accused needed before he could be tried without unfairness or injustice. ... At 9, their Honours reiterated the test to be applied, namely, whether the accused person ""is capable of understanding the proceedings at the trial so as to be able to make a proper defence"".
[133]  The High Court again dealt with the question of fitness to be tried in Kesavarajah v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 230. ... Again, the Court accepted the test to be applied was one that ""looks to the capacity of the accused to understand the proceedings"". ...
[134] In Eastman v the Queen (2000) 203 CLR 1; [2000] HCA 29 ... Gaudron J said at [57] that in general terms, a person was fit to plead if that person ""has sufficient understanding to comprehend the nature of [the trial] so as to make a proper defence to the charge"". ...
...
[142] In R v Rivkin (2004) 59 NSWLR 284; [2004] NSWCCA 7, the Court (Mason P, Wood CJ at CL and Sully J) held at [279] that the question of fitness to be tried was to be determined by application of the Presser test:
""The test for determining fitness to stand trial is whether the accused has a sufficient mental state, and intellect, to comprehend the course of the proceedings involved in the trial, so as to follow those proceedings, and so as to make a proper defence. The factors to be taken account have been accepted as being those developed in R v Presser (supra), an authority which has been consistently followed in this State and elsewhere: see for example R v Mailes, R v Zhang [2000] NSWCCA 344, R v Tier (2001) 121 A Crim R 509, and Kesavarajah v The Queen(1994) 181 CLR 230.""
[143]  In Rivkin, the question of unfitness to be tried arose after conviction when it was established that the appellant had a brain tumour which would have caused frontal lobe dysfunction. Again, the Court referred in some detail to the authorities discussed above, which were adopted as correctly stating the law. The additional consideration in Rivkin was the test to be applied where the question of fitness to be tried is raised after conviction. That is not an issue here. However, their Honours were also considering a question that is relevant here, namely, where a person has a ""temporary condition"". In that regard, their Honours said at [296]-[298]:
""So far as the present case involves a temporary condition, which was amenable to treatment, and which has since been reversed, so that no current question of fitness arises, it does differ from most, if not all, of the other cases which have attracted an application of the requirements in R v Presser.
The central question which arises, in this respect, is whether a reduction in the capacity of an accused to meet the requirements in R v Presser, but which falls short of denying to that accused the capacity to understand and to follow the proceedings in each of the necessary aspects, is sufficient to constitute unfitness, and to justify appellate intervention, in accordance with the test previously mentioned.
... The test in R v Presser is directed to the minimum requirements for a fair trial. So long as the accused can understand and follow the proceedings in each of its facets, can give appropriate instructions, and can present a proper defence to the charge, he or she is to be regarded as fit to be tried. The fact that the accused may have done so in a better way, had suitable medical treatment or medication been provided, or had that accused possessed greater intelligence or acuity of mind, does not seem to us to be relevant to the question of fitness.""
[144] The Court concluded at [301] that the question of fitness to be tried related to the ""essential requirements"" as stated in Presser. 32I am satisfied that Mr Feili is ""capable of understanding the proceedings at the trial so as to be able to make a proper defence"".  It has not been suggested that he does not have the mental capacity to understand sufficiently what is going on in court, or to understand the substantial effect of any evidence given against him.  If he happens to miss any aspect of the evidence that is relevant to him, it must be within the capacity of his lawyers, armed with whatever notes they are taking of the evidence and also with a daily transcript, to inform him of it.  Even if it is correct to conclude that Mr Feili has a reduced capacity to meet the Presser criteria, particularly those mentioned above, that does not mean that he is unfit to be tried; he will only be unfit if he is denied that capacity:  R v Rivkin [2004] NSWCCA 7; (2004) 59 NSWLR 284 at [297]-[301] per Mason P, Wood CJ at CL and Sully J.  Conclusion
33I accept that Mr Feili may well have a reduced capacity to meet two of the criteria in Presser for being regarded as fit to be tried but I was not persuaded that he is completely denied that capacity.  There are steps available to substantially overcome any shortfall in relation to those matters.
34The accused Taleb Feili is fit to be tried.

		03 May 2013",2013-03-12 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2707065,R v Edwards [2013] NSWDC 329,"Judgment

1Kristy Leigh Edwards came before me at Bourke on 25 October 2012. I delivered a short judgment on that day explaining why I was adjourning her case. I adjourned it under s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) so that she could convince me that she was on the path to rehabilitation. 

2Her case has come before me a number of times since then and the progress has been unsatisfactory. What I mean by that is that although she has apparently been making attempts to get into a facility, she has not turned up to Court on most of the times that I listed her case. In the end I had no choice but to issue a Bench Warrant. She was arrested and has come before the Court at Dubbo today. She is appearing by video link before me. I am sitting in Sydney and she is represented by Mr A Wong here in Sydney. 

3I was inclined to dismiss her appeal and to direct that she therefore serve the balance of the sentence which was imposed by the magistrate. Mr Wong however pointed out that she had been making genuine efforts to secure a place in a rehabilitation centre but places were not available because of the time of the year. He pointed out, significantly, that the seriousness of the three crimes she committed was relatively speaking quite low. He has a point there because the shoplifting involved low price domestic items. However as I pointed out in my earlier judgment, the crime that she has been convicted of does deal with property under the value of $2,000. 

4Significantly, Mr Wong pointed out that his client had received a suspended sentence in 2010 and had not breached that. I was attracted to the idea of giving her a suspended sentence back in Bourke. Mr D Pheeney who then appeared for her thought that such a sentence might be setting her up to fail. What he meant was that for a client who has a criminal record and gets into trouble reasonably frequently, a suspended sentence may mean that she is more likely to breach the bond and end up in gaol again. That was the reason I did not impose it then.

5But the combination of the points made by Mr Wong - namely that the crimes were relatively low in seriousness and Ms Edwards has had a successful suspended sentence before - incline me to reconsider it as an option. In addition Mr Wong pointed out that Ms Edwards has a strong motivation for staying out of gaol. She wants to keep her Housing Commission home. There is a Tribunal hearing about that on 13 March. It is important for her to keep her home because she wants to obtain the return of her children who have been taken away from her by the State authorities. She also has a sick father.

6Ms R Barrington, who appears for the respondent Director of Public Prosecutions, realistically expresses concerns given Ms Edwards' criminal history. She raises the real prospect of Ms Edwards re-offending. I agree with her that that is a risk.

7On balance I am persuaded by Mr Wong that I should impose a suspended sentence. However I propose to increase the overall sentence from effectively 4 months to effectively 6 months and I propose to suspend the 6 month sentence. I appreciate that increasing the sentence runs against the proposition that the offences were low in seriousness. However in increasing the sentence I have borne in mind Ms Edwards' criminal record and the fact that other options have been exhausted. She really leaves the Court with very few options. I have warned Ms Edwards that the effect of increasing the sentence will be that if she breaches the bond attached to the suspended sentence, she is at risk of serving more time in gaol than that imposed by the magistrate. The additional time is not only the 6 months which I impose but the time she has already served in custody which apparently amounts to some 1 month and 7 days. She is prepared to accept that risk.

8For each of the offences that Ms Edwards has been convicted of, I sentence her to 6 months imprisonment but under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I suspend the whole of the execution of that sentence for the whole of the period on condition that Ms Edwards enters into a good behaviour bond. The conditions of the bond are these:

(1)That she be of good behaviour.
(2)That she notify the registrar of the Court at Bourke of any change in her residential address.
(3)That she attend Court if called upon to do so.
(4)That she make herself available for supervision by the Probation and Parole Service and accept all reasonable recommendations and directions by any officer of that service.
(5)She should report to the office of Probation and Parole Service at Bourke on or before Friday 8 March 2013.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Wong and Ms Barrington before I explain the sentence to Ms Edwards, are there any other conditions that I should impose or any suggestions about the form of the sentence? Mr Wong?
WONG: No your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Ms Barrington?
BARRINGTON: No your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Okay, Ms Edwards you've got another sentence. In fact you've got three sentences. Do you understand that?
OFFENDER: Yes I do.
HIS HONOUR: They're 6 months each. Do you understand?
OFFENDER: Yes.
HIS HONOUR: I've suspended them so you should be released later on today. Do you understand that?
OFFENDER: Yes I do.
HIS HONOUR: All right, there are conditions. I've imposed a bond. You've heard me do that. The conditions are that you've got to stay out of trouble for 6 months, do you understand that?
OFFENDER: Yes I do.
HIS HONOUR: If you change your address, you've got to write to the Registrar of the Court at Bourke. You can turn up and write out and give the letter to him there if you like saying what your new address is, do you understand?
OFFENDER: Yes I do.
HIS HONOUR: And if you get something in the mail telling you you've got to turn up to Court, I don't want to have to send out the police or the sheriff again to arrest you. You've got to turn up. Do you understand?
OFFENDER: Yes I do.
HIS HONOUR: And the most important thing is that you turn up at Bourke Probation and Parole before Friday week, before tomorrow week, do you understand?
OFFENDER: Yes I do.
HIS HONOUR: And you've got to agree with what they suggest so far as supervision, do you understand?
OFFENDER: Yes I do.
HIS HONOUR: All right, there's a person there you know, is that right? One of the people you're dealing with?
OFFENDER: Yes.
HIS HONOUR: What's her name?
OFFENDER: Debbie.
HIS HONOUR: Debbie, is that right? And do you get on well with Debbie? Do you get on all right?
OFFENDER: Yeah, yes.
HIS HONOUR: All right, well you let Debbie help you and the idea is for you to stay out of trouble for six months, do you understand?
OFFENDER: Yes I do.
HIS HONOUR: All right, now I said, I'm not taking the risk, the community is taking the risk and the shopkeepers and people who run businesses in Bourke and Dubbo, I'm exposing them to the risk of letting you loose, do you understand?
OFFENDER: Yes I do.
HIS HONOUR: And I don't want you to break the bond, all right?
OFFENDER: Yes.
HIS HONOUR: If you break the bond, as you probably know, it is very hard for me not to send to gaol. The law is very strict. If you breach a suspended sentence bond, you've pretty well got to go to gaol and you'll probably end up serving longer than the magistrate gave you. Do you understand that?
OFFENDER: Yes I do.
HIS HONOUR: Okay Ms Edwards. Well you've got a lot to stay out of trouble for with your house, your dad and your children. And you let Debbie help you sort out your life, do you understand?
OFFENDER: Yes I do.
HIS HONOUR: Okay, anything else Mr Wong or Ms Barrington?
WONG: No your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Okay, thank you both for your assistance and I'll now adjourn.

		18 August 2014",2013-02-27 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2707068,R v Amanda Convery aka Crombie [2013] NSWDC 69,"Judgment
1HIS HONOUR: The offender, Amanda Convery, grew up in circumstances in which the decisions she made as to how she would live her life, in particular whether she would use drugs and whether she would commit crimes, were be made against a family background where she was surrounded by violence, drug use and offending surrounding her. 

2On top of that, Ms Convery suffers from a significant mental illness and a significant level of intellectual disability. She committed two serious crimes and they have caused significant harm, but in assessing the appropriate sentences to impose it is important to understand that, because of the sort of things I have already mentioned, her moral culpability is much less than it would otherwise have been. 

3Two police officers were engaged in traffic duties in Redfern in the early hours of 1 April last year. About 5 o'clock that morning Ms Convery, under the influence of drugs and having not taken her antipsychotic medication for some time, was walking along the street singing and swearing and holding a glass tumbler. She was approached by police who spoke to her about her behaviour. She then went on to the concourse of Redfern railway station. She continued to shout and she continued to swear. Constable Carasco approached her and asked her to quieten down and go home. 

4She kept gesticulating at Constable Flood, the other police officer, indicating that she should come over. At this stage Constable Flood ignored that suggestion, but over the next sixty minutes Ms Convery continued to swear at the police officers. She called them ""white cunts"" and ""white dogs"". The two officers were busy. They were involved with traffic duties which resulted from a large crane involved in building works being parked on the roadway. 

5Eventually Constable Carasco returned to Ms Convery. She said, ""Why did you come over? Why didn't the other one"", (clearly a reference to Constable Flood), ""come over? I'm going to smash her."" It was at about 6.02 that Constable Flood did go over to Ms Convery and spoke to her about her offensive language and behaviour. Ms Convery then said, ""Do you want to charge me? Hey, I'll fucking show you."" She then put the tumbler she had been holding on to a ticket barrier and pulled a syringe out from her dress. She then used the needle on the syringe to stab Constable Flood very close to her left eye, in fact only one centimetre away. 

6She did not stop after this. She continued to punch Constable Flood a number of times. Eventually after she stopped Constable Flood noticed that she was injured. She had a great deal of pain to her nose, and there was both a puncture wound to her left temple and a scratch down her left cheek where the needle had been dragged downwards. 

7Whilst Ms Convery was hitting Constable Flood, she was saying, ""I want to go into custody, you white cunt."" Constable Flood went to both defend herself and arrest Ms Convery, and was assisted by Constable Carasco, who ran over the road as soon as he saw what was happening. She was handcuffed and taken to Redfern Police Station. She was introduced to the custody manager. She said to him that she was iced. Her demeanour was such that she couldn't be interviewed by police. 

8Constable Flood went to Sydney Hospital, where the injuries that I have spoken about were noted. Of course of great concern to Constable Flood was the possibility that she had contracted a disease from being stabbed with the needle. One can easily understand how that would cause significant psychological harm. It was entirely foreseeable that having been stabbed by a needle, the officer would suffer significant psychological consequences. 

9She read her victim impact statement to me in Court. She spoke about her feelings. She spoke about what she went through, what she thought, the plans she made, and what was going to happen to her and her family if the worst came to the worst. Although after some time it was discovered that as a matter of extreme good fortune Constable Flood had not contracted any disease from what the offender did, even today she was clearly distressed by having to recount what had happened to her and what she has been through over the past eleven months. 

10I have read many victim impact statements in my time. I have had many read to me. They are often eloquent explanations of the harm that offences cause. It is important that judges are reminded there are real human beings who are harmed by offences for which they sentence. Often those victim impact statements make a suggestion to me as to how I should go about sentencing the offender, almost invariably suggesting that a harsh sentence should be imposed. 

11In contrast to what usually occurs I want to commend Constable Flood in the strongest terms for what she has said. She says:

""I hope the decision that is made here today is for the best interests of the general public and the best interests for Amanda Convery, the offender."" 

12That is a truly remarkable statement to make in a victim impact statement. 

13I should also mention something else about the aftermath of this offence. A few days after the attack a police officer contacted the offender's legal representative. A request was made for the cooperation of Ms Convery as to the release of her current medical status so that the possible ramifications for Constable Flood could be more accurately understood as soon as it could be done. Ms Convery consented to her Justice Health records being made available to that officer. That is consistent with what Ms Convery has said both in Court and to others as regards her remorse for what she has done to the officer. 

14I spoke briefly earlier about Ms Convery's background. It was a background where she was subject to sexual abuse, where she witnessed domestic violence, and where people around her were involved in drug use, all from a very tender age. I will give an example. Ms Convery got involved in petrol sniffing at the age of five. A fiveyearold child cannot reason about whether it is a good idea or a bad idea to sniff petrol when other children around them are doing exactly that same thing. Somewhat remarkably she was introduced to cannabis by a relative who, and I know this is unusual to say, appears to have had Ms Convery's best interests at heart. He wanted her to give up petrol sniffing and use cannabis instead. She began to get into trouble with the law when she started copying her brother's behaviour and so I have no hesitation in accepting that the principals to be found in R v Fernando [1999] NSWCCA 66 are to be applied, and significantly so in the present case. 

15The choices which Ms Convery made about how she would live her life as she grew up were very much influenced by the terrible circumstances in which she was brought up, and I repeat on top of that she experienced problems with her mental function. Those problems, of course, continue to this day. 

16Let me speak about those problems of and mental function. She has a significant history of being treated for schizophrenia. She experiences paranoia and hears voices from time to time. When she is treated and when she complies with her medication she is in a much better state, but when she chooses to stop taking her medication and when she chooses to take illegal drugs those two matters cause her mental functioning to go downhill, and so it was on the morning of 1 April last year. 

17I do not want anyone to think that Ms Convery is able to simply say, ""I suffer from a mental illness. I was mentally ill at the time of the offence therefore I should not be punished,"" because despite all Ms Convery's difficulties it is ultimately her decision as to whether she takes the drugs prescribed for her and her decision as to whether she takes illegal drugs in the knowledge that they will significantly adversely affect her mental state. 

18Ms Convery has a significant criminal history. It began, as I said, when she started copying her brother's behaviour, and so there are many matters on her criminal history involving offences committed by her when she was under eighteen. She is now twentythree. She did spend some time in juvenile detection, but since turning eighteen she has not spent any time in a prison apart from being bail refused for the offences that she currently faces. I have got no doubt that she has noticed to a significant extent the different conditions that apply in juvenile detention and in prison, particularly Mulawa. 

19Although for obvious reasons general deterrence has much less of a part to play in the sentencing exercise, personal deterrence remains of some importance. 

20The conditions of anyone serving a sentence at Mulawa are not good, but on top of that Ms Convery's residual paranoia and residual problems in mental functioning, which remain even after taking the drugs prescribed for her, mean that she will do her time in custody harder than someone who does not suffer from those disadvantages. 

21It is also to be said that the prospects for Ms Convery's rehabilitation are guarded. She is going to need an enormous level of support when she is released back into the community. Because of the length of the sentence that I am about to impose, it is not me who states the conditions of parole, but I will say this, a great deal of effort must be spent on Ms Convery when she is released into custody in order to help not only her, but also the community. If she is not given what she needs then I have got little doubt that she will commit further crimes. Some might be minor, but others might be as serious as the ones for which she is sentenced today and if that happens then someone else is going to be harmed. So spending a great deal of effort on Ms Convery upon her release from custody is not done simply to help her, but to prevent other people being as harmed as Constable Flood has been. 

22I note that there is a standard nonparole period applying to one of the offences, that is the offence of assaulting a police officer in the execution of her duty and occasioning actual bodily harm to her. The maximum penalty for that offence is seven years and the standard nonparole period is three years. My reasons for not imposing the standard nonparole period for that matter are to be found in these remarks on sentence. The other offence is an offence of using an offensive weapon to commit an indictable offence, the indictable offence being assault occasioning actual bodily harm. 

23The question of accumulation was raised. It was raised by the Crown, who submitted that I would not accumulate. I am not going to totally accumulate, but there is to be a partial level of accumulation for this reason. The two offences do not entirely overlap, they focus on different aspects of Ms Convery's criminality. For that reason there will be a level of partial accumulation, but not all that much it must be said. 

24A submission was made that there were special circumstances in this case and of course the Crown did not argue against that submission. Indeed the effective nonparole period that I have decided to impose is less than half the total term. I recognise that is unusual, certainly since the late 1980s where the legislation began to change the rules regarding the proportion that a nonparole period should bear to its head sentence, but these are very special circumstances. As I have mentioned many times, it is in the community's interests that Ms Convery be supervised for an extended period whilst she is on parole and a close watch needs to be kept upon her. 

25The sentences I impose are as follows. For the offence of using an offensive weapon with intent to commit an indictable offence I set a fixed term of imprisonment of two years, to date from 1 April 2012. That is a fixed term because of the sentence I am about to announce. For the offence of assaulting a police officer in the execution of her duty I sentence Ms Convery to imprisonment. I set a nonparole period of two years to commence on 1 October 2012, and I impose a period of eligibility for parole of three and a half years. Thus the overall sentence consists of a nonparole period of two and a half years, a period of eligibility for parole of three and a half years, making a total overall sentence of six years, with Ms Convery being eligible to be released to parole on 30 September 2014.

2707070,Adam Mansour v R Shannon Hughes v R [2013] NSWCCA 35,"Judgment

1SIMPSON J: I agree with Bellew J.

2McCALLUM J: I agree with Bellew J.

3BELLEW J: The applicants Adam Mansour (""Mansour"") and Shannon Hughes (""Hughes"") were each indicted before Judge Woodburne SC in the District Court for an offence against s. 33(1) of the Crimes Act of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, as well as an offence of affray contrary to s. 93C(1). Each pleaded not guilty to those offences.

4Following a judge alone trial, her Honour found each of the applicants not guilty of the offence against s. 33(1), but guilty of the statutory alternative, namely an offence of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm in company, contrary to s. 35(1). Her Honour also found each guilty of the offence of affray.

5Prior to the commencement of the trial, Mansour had offered to plead to the statutory alternative of which he was ultimately found guilty. That offer was rejected by the Crown.

6On 10 February 2012 her Honour imposed the following sentences:
 
MANSOUR




OFFENCE

MAXIMUM PENALTY

SENTENCE


Recklessly causing grievous bodily harm (Crimes Act s. 35(1))

Imprisonment for 14 yrs
Standard non-parole period of 5 yrs.



Non-parole period of 2 yrs and 9 days, to date from 25 June 2011 and to expire on 3 July 2013, and a total term of 4 yrs and 18 days expiring on 12 July 2015. Additional matter on Form 1 (possession of prescribed restricted substance) taken into account.


Affray (Crimes Act s. 93C(1))

Imprisonment for 10 yrs.

Non-parole period of 1 year 6 months to date from 25 June 2011 and to expire on 24 December 2012 and a total term of 3 yrs expiring on 24 June 2014.


HUGHES




OFFENCE

MAXIMUM PENALTY

SENTENCE


Recklessly cause grievous bodily harm (Crimes Act s. 35(1))

Imprisonment for 14 yrs
Standard non-parole period of 5 yrs.

Non-parole period of 2 yrs and 3 months to date from 20 July 2011 and expire on 19 October 2013 and a total term of 4 yrs and 6 months expiring on 19 January 2016.


Affray (Crimes Act s. 93C(1))

Imprisonment for 10 yrs

Non-parole period of 1 yr and 8 months to date from 20 July 2011 and expire on 19 March 2013 and a total term of 3 yrs 4 months expiring on 19 November 2014.

7The three month difference in the sentences imposed is explained by the fact that Mansour received a 10% discount to reflect his offer to plead guilty to the alternative offence of which he was found guilty.

8Each applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentences. Neither applicant has appealed against his conviction and no issue was raised on the hearing of the appeal regarding parity.
THE FACTS
9Her Honour set out the facts at some length in her judgment. Those facts were determined partly on the basis of CCTV footage tendered in evidence before her Honour and may be summarised as follows. 

10On Saturday 17 October 2009, James McGuinness (""the victim"") spent the evening at home with a group of friends celebrating the birthday of his girlfriend. Later that night the group decided to go to a club in Kings Cross called ""Candy's Apartments"". The victim and his friends arrived there at about midnight.

11Also at the club on that evening were Hughes, Mansour and a friend of theirs, Steven Elmir (""Elmir""). The victim was not previously known to any of these three persons.

12At about 2.31 am, the victim was sitting at a table in the club when Elmir backed into him. Elmir turned around to the victim, and they exchanged words, with Elmir adopting an aggressive stance towards the victim. About one minute later, the victim got up from where he had been sitting. Elmir stepped away in the direction of the exit and beckoned the victim to follow him, in an apparent attempt to have the victim come outside to continue the argument. The victim declined, and sat back down.

13At that point, Elmir walked over and spoke with Hughes, who was described by her Honour (along with Mansour) as a ""powerfully built young man"". There was no evidence before her Honour as to what was said between Elmir and Hughes at that time, but her Honour was satisfied that Elmir spoke with Hughes about the victim, and that he (Elmir) pointed out the victim with the intention of seeking and obtaining support, from Hughes, for a confrontation with the victim.

14When Elmir spoke with Hughes, they were joined by Mansour. Elmir, followed by Mansour, walked back towards the victim, who was minding his own business sitting down at a table. Elmir tried to engage the victim, who remained seated. Mansour remained close to Elmir as Elmir was standing over the victim and behaving aggressively towards him. 

15Elmir's behaviour attracted the attention of a security guard, a Mr Wang (""Wang""), who came over towards Elmir. At that point, Mansour gave Wang a ""thumbs up"" signal and then repositioned himself so as to stand at the end of the table at which the victim was seated. Wang went to walk past them. Elmir continued to behave aggressively towards the victim, at which time Wang turned back and looked in their direction.

16Wang moved closer to Elmir and was about to put his hand on him, when Elmir lunged forward into the victim and put his left hand on the area of the victim's right shoulder and neck. He then engaged in what appeared to be a punching action, or an elbow punch, with his right hand or arm. Mansour was in close proximity to Elmir when he struck the victim, and was looking at both of them. At this point the victim's girlfriend started to make her way over to assist him.

17Wang attempted to hold Elmir and managed to get at least one of his arms (and possibly both of them) around his torso. The victim rose from his seat and tried to push Elmir away from him, at which stage Mansour and Hughes moved in. As the victim rose from his seat, Hughes held his shirt from behind. The victim threw a punch at Elmir, connecting with his right ear.

18Mansour then moved towards the victim with his left arm raised, and bent at the elbow. As the victim was leaning back, Mansour wound up for a punch by bringing his right arm well back, with his left arm reaching over to the victim's left arm. 

19At this point, the victim was the subject of attack from three different directions. Elmir struck him with his right arm, Hughes pulled him back and down, swinging a left handed punch to him and bringing him to the ground, and Mansour delivered a powerful punch to the back of the victim's head. 

20After the victim had been felled by their combined force, and whilst lying helpless on the ground and offering no resistance, Mansour and Hughes continued to attack him. Mansour kicked the victim with his right foot. As Wang tried to restrain Mansour, Hughes continued the attack by stomping on the victim. 

21Another security officer, along with a Mr Bussell (""Bussell"") who was a friend of the victim, tried to intervene. Hughes pushed Bussell back with some considerable force. Another security officer intervened and took hold of Hughes' left arm, at which stage Mansour moved in again. As one of the security officers again tried to take hold of Hughes, he leaned directly over the top of the victim and continued the assault by forcefully stomping on him. 

22One of the security officers again tried to take hold of Hughes, but Mansour grabbed the officer from behind and pulled him away. As Hughes was delivering a final kick to the victim who was lying on the ground, he was finally restrained, telling the security officer to ""fuck off cunt"". 

23As a consequence of the attack upon him, the victim was knocked unconscious and taken to hospital. He was diagnosed as having suffered a compound fracture of the mandible, associated fractures of his teeth and damage to his facial nerves. He was hospitalised, and underwent surgery. His teeth were wired and incisions were made to access the facial bones for the purposes of aligning bone fragments, following which plates were inserted to assist the bones to heal. He suffered bruises and abrasions to his head, neck and body, as well as a fracture of the left ring finger which required the insertion of metal screws. 

24As a result of the injury to his teeth, the victim was required to undergo four root canal procedures, and the insertion of four crowns. There was evidence that the victim suffered continuing pain in his jaw and teeth, which was managed by strong analgesic medication. Further evidence before her Honour established that the victim had also suffered psychological damage, brought about at least in part by his pain levels, and which had manifested itself in panic attacks when amongst large crowds. Unsurprisingly, her Honour found that the incident had been an extremely traumatic one for him.

25Her Honour concluded that it was not possible to identify which blow caused the grievous bodily harm to the victim. However, she found that it was the combined force of Hughes and Mansour, acting together, which had caused the victim's injuries. She found that as a result of the joint attack, the victim was felled to the ground by the combined force of Hughes and Mansour, who forcefully punched the victim to the ground. Thereafter, the victim was forcefully kicked by Mansour and kicked and stomped upon by Hughes.

THE FINDINGS OF THE SENTENCING JUDGE
26On sentence, it was submitted to her Honour that the grievous bodily harm suffered by the victim was at the lower end of the scale. Her Honour observed that the scale was a wide one, which extended to very significant injuries including permanent brain damage. She concluded that the injury in the present case was at the lower end of the scale, although she also observed that this ""did not mean ... that the offence was not a serious one"". 

27Her Honour proceeded to make reference to a number of other factors which were relevant in assessing the seriousness of the conduct of the two applicants. Her Honour said (at AB 99):

""The nature and number of blows and the circumstances in which they were inflicted are to be taken into account. In the present case these two powerfully built young men each delivered a forceful punch and kick to Mr McGuinness and Mr Hughes also stomped on the victim. After Mr McGuinness had been felled he was effectively unconscious and unresisting. The level of violence displayed was not at the highest end, of course, however it was significant. It was unprovoked, unwarranted and frankly sickening, as a view of the CCTV footage bears out. The offenders were not armed and that is to be brought into account, however they used their fists and feet as effective weapons. This was a brutal attack and it was cowardly in the circumstances.""

28Specifically in relation to the offence of affray, her Honour observed (at AB 100):

""The scale and level of violence, its duration and circumstances in which it occurred are all relevant considerations...Here the affray took place in a crowded nightclub. A viewing of the CCTV footage is persuasive evidence that the violent action of the offenders, the punch and kick by Mr Mansour and the punching, stomping and kicking by Mr Hughes, clearly had a capacity to engender fear. Indeed, in this case the bystanders were subjected to not only to seeing the cowardly and violent attack perpetrated on Mr McGuinness, but also the aftermath of it. Some patrons can be seen on the CCTV footage pointing out or looking at Mr McGuinness lying unconscious and bleeding on the floor.""

29Her Honour then proceeded to recount the subjective circumstances of each of the applicants. 

30In the case of Hughes, her Honour found that he had expressed regret for his behaviour, that he had expressed remorse, and that he felt ashamed of his conduct. Her Honour also made reference to the fact that Hughes had acknowledged a problem with alcohol, and had resolved to address it. For these reasons, she concluded that his prospects of rehabilitation were good. 

31Her Honour noted that Hughes had appeared at the Liverpool Local Court on 29 September 2009, approximately three and a half weeks prior to the commission of the present offence, and had been given a bond under s. 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Act"") for a period of 12 months in respect of a charge of stalking and/or intimidating. This was a circumstance of aggravation.

32In respect of Mansour, her Honour found that he was still relatively young at the time of the offence. She found that he had expressed regret and remorse, was significantly affected by alcohol at the time of the commission of the offence, and had good prospects of rehabilitation. 

33As was the case with Hughes, Mansour was also the subject of a good behaviour bond under s. 9 of the Sentencing Act. On 31 August 2009, a little short of seven weeks prior to the commission of the present offences, Mansour had been placed on a bond for a period of 2 years in respect of two counts of assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty. That bond was imposed in the District Court, following a successful appeal against the decision of a Magistrate to impose a term of 3 months imprisonment. 

34None of her Honour's findings, be they findings as to the facts, the objective seriousness of the offence, or the level of criminality displayed by either of the applicants, were challenged in this appeal. 

THE GROUND OF APPEAL
The sentence was manifestly excessive in all of the circumstances.
35In advancing this ground of appeal, counsel for the applicants was not able to identify any specific error on the part of the sentencing judge. He submitted that an inference should be drawn from the sentences imposed in each case that there was a failure on the part of the sentencing judge to properly exercise her discretion (see generally House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 especially at 505). 

36As I understood it, counsel advanced the proposition that such an inference should be drawn from:

(i)Judicial Commission statistics; and

(ii)an asserted inconsistency between her Honour's findings as to the degree of bodily harm sustained by the victim, and the sentences which were ultimately imposed. 

37As to the first of those matters, there have been repeated observations regarding the limited use to which such statistics can be put (see for example R v Nikolovska [2010] NSWCCA 169 at [70] per Kirby J (with whom Beazley JA and Johnson J agreed); Hili v R; Jones v R (2010) 242 CLR 520; [2010] HCA 45 at [55]), and the caution with which they are to be approached (see Lobsey v R [2012] NSWCCA 239 at [28]). These observations are particularly apposite in circumstances where, as here, the statistical sample amounted to only 37 cases. 

38The statistics establish that of the 37 cases, 87% of the offenders received non-parole periods of 2 years or less. I do not accept the submission advanced by counsel that the sentence imposed in either case is excessive based on those statistics alone. The issue is not whether the sentence imposed by her Honour in each case fell outside a particular statistical range. Rather, the issue is whether the sentence in each case fell outside the range of the permissible exercise of her Honour's discretion (as to which see Apthorpe v R [2012] NSWCCA 100 at [70] per Garling J). In my view, for the reasons more fully set out below, the sentence imposed did not fall outside of the range which was applicable in the case of each applicant. 

39The second matter relied upon by counsel as a circumstance from which an inference could be drawn that the sentencing discretion had miscarried, was a suggested inconsistency between her Honour's finding as to the degree of bodily harm sustained by the victim, and the sentences imposed. 

40Her Honour concluded (at AB 98) that the injury sustained by the victim was at the lower end of the scale. In the light of the evidence, that conclusion might be viewed as being somewhat favourable to each of the applicants. In any event, the proposition that the non parole period imposed by her Honour in each case was excessive having regard to that finding is, in my view, without merit. The maximum penalty for the offence under s. 35(1) is 14 years imprisonment, with a standard non-parole period of 5 years. Bearing in mind those statutory guide posts, and the totality of the evidence, her Honour's imposition of a non-parole period of just over two years in each case was, in my view, not inconsistent with her finding as to the level of injury which was sustained by the victim. 

41In further support of the submission that there was such an inconsistency, counsel for the applicants relied upon a decision of this court in R v Mitchell; R v Gallagher [2007] NSWCCA 296. In that case (which involved offences against ss. 33 and 35 of the Crimes Act) Howie J (at [27]) observed that a very important aspect in sentencing for this type of offending is the result of the offender's conduct. He also observed that the nature of the injury caused to the victim will, to a very significant degree, determine the seriousness of the offence and the appropriate sentence. 

42It is important to bear in mind that Howie J did not go so far as to say that the result of an offender's conduct was the only consideration to be taken into account when sentencing for offending of this nature. The fact that there are a number of other matters to be taken into account was reiterated by his Honour in a subsequent decision of R v McCulloch [2009] NSWCCA 94; (2009) 194 A Crim R 39 where he said (at [37]):

""Generally speaking the seriousness of the offence will depend upon the seriousness of the wounding. That is not to say that the manner in which the wounding was inflicted, the reason for the infliction of the wound and the circumstances surrounding the wound are irrelevant"". 

43In AM v R [2012] NSWCCA 203 Johnson J (commencing at [71]) reviewed the authorities concerning relevant considerations in sentencing for an offence against s33(1) of the Crimes Act. As I have already observed, the present applicants were found not guilty of that offence, and guilty of the statutory alternative. However, there are matters to which his Honour referred which, in my view, are relevant to the determination of an appropriate sentence for both of those offences. They include the degree of violence and the ferocity of the attack (see R v Zhang [2004] NSWCCA 358), the fact that it was sustained and there were opportunities for the offender to desist which were not taken (see R v Westerman [2004] NSWCCA 161), the fact that it was unprovoked (see Matzick v R [2007] NSWCCA 92) and the fact it was perpetrated upon an innocent citizen who was going about his ordinary business (see R v Woods (CCA (NSW) 9 October 1990 unreported). 

44It is also relevant to note that conduct of the nature of that displayed by the present applicants, which involved kicking and stomping, has been described as being ""a familiar method of inflicting serious injury in modern times"" which is to be regarded by the courts as ""abhorrent and worthy ... of condign punishment"" (see R v Wright [1998] VSCA 84 at [2] cited by Johnson J in AM v R (supra at [81])).

45In determining the appropriate sentence her Honour, correctly in my view, did not limit herself to a consideration of the injury sustained to the victim. Having reached the conclusion that the injury was at the lower end of the scale, her Honour immediately, and again correctly, pointed out that this did not mean that the offence was not a serious one. She then proceeded to recount (at AB 99) a number of relevant circumstances of the offending. They included the nature and number of blows inflicted, the fact that the victim was rendered unconscious, and the significant level of unprovoked violence which was displayed by each of the applicants toward the victim. Her Honour's reference to such matters tends wholly against the proposition that there was some inconsistency between her findings and the sentences she ultimately imposed. 

46What brought about the attack upon the victim was a seemingly innocuous incident in which neither of the applicants was in any way involved. Having decided, apparently at the behest of Elmir, to become involved in something which was of no concern to them, each of the applicants engaged in an attack which her Honour described as unprovoked, unwarranted, sickening, brutal and cowardly. That, in my view, was a completely accurate description of what took place. As I have already observed, no complaint is made about her Honour's findings in any respect whatsoever. The conduct of each of the applicants was significantly aggravated by the fact that each was on a good behaviour bond in respect of offences of violence, each bond having been imposed only a matter of weeks before. 

47The victim had a legitimate expectation that he would be able to socialise with his friends at a nightclub without being subjected to acts of violence of the kind her Honour described. As her Honour pointed out, the attack was perpetrated upon the victim in total disregard of his entitlement to a sense of security and personal safety, and was one which left him with a number of physical and psychological injuries. Despite her Honour's assessment that those injuries fell at the lower end of the relevant scale, they were nevertheless significant, as was the offending overall.

48In my view the sentences imposed by her Honour were not unreasonable, nor were they plainly unjust (see Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 325 per Gleeson CJ and Hayne J). It follows that the sentences were not manifestly excessive and the ground of appeal has not been made out. The submissions advanced on behalf of each of the applicants do not, in my view, justify a grant of leave to appeal. 

49I propose the following order:

(i)leave to appeal refused.

		28 February 2013",2013-02-26 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2707082,R v Russo [2013] NSWDC 47,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: Many people enjoy betting. Many people enjoy betting on horse races. A lot of people do not, but those that do are entitled to have things as fair as possible. They are entitled to have horses run on their merits and they are entitled to have the authorities act properly in ensuring that that is the case. What the offender, Michael Russo, did was, on eleven occasions, act corruptly by giving or offering a benefit to a steward in the harness racing authority, so that horses with which he, Mr Russo, was involved with would not be tested by the stewards. He did this because he knew that if such testing was undertaken it would reveal matters of concern, usually that the horses had been given something to enhance their performance. This is corruption in a pastime which is important to many people. It is corruption which must be dealt with severely when it is detected. The Court of Criminal Appeal in a decision called Regina v Potter [2005] NSWCCA 26 demonstrated just how serious corruption, including of stewards, in the racing industry is.

2The offender has pleaded guilty to nine counts of corruptly giving a benefit to an agent and asks that when I sentence him for the first of those matters, I take into account two other counts of corruptly offering to give a benefit to an agent on a Form 1. He pleaded guilty to those matters at the first opportunity and so the sentences I will impose upon him are twenty-five per cent less than they would otherwise have been.

3The corrupt activity extended over a significant period. It began sometime in early 2010. Quite who approached whom I am unable to determine, but in February 2010 the first of a series of transactions took place. Mr Russo contacted a steward by the name of Matthew Bentley, a corrupt steward who, somewhat amazingly, has been granted an immunity from prosecution so he may never face punishment for his involvement in what I am about to describe.

4The purpose of Mr Russo contacting Mr Bentley was to confirm that Mr Bentley would be the steward working at a particular harness racing meet on 22 February 2010. The two men worked out that Mr Bentley would be there that day and Mr Russo nominated a particular horse of his and asked that that horse not be pre-race drug-tested. An agreement was reached that if that horse won the race, the steward would be paid by Mr Russo. The horse did win. The connections of the horse received $1,400 in prize money and in the following days Mr Bentley received $500 cash from Mr Russo. 

5The whole purpose of this meeting was so that the horse could run after receiving what is described as a ""milkshake"" or some other similar performance enhancing substance. A milkshake involves the administering of bicarbonate of soda to the horse by way of drenching. Drenching is the administration of the substance in a tube fed through the nose of the horse going directly into the horse's stomach. The reason this is done is to elevate the total carbon dioxide level of the horse which counters the naturally occurring build-up of lactic acid that takes place during vigorous exercise. Fatigue is limited and endurance is increased. The harness racing authorities of course know all about the effects of bicarbonate of soda on a horse, and so one of the testing procedures they undertake is designed to detect elevated levels of total carbon dioxide in horses.

6So on 22 February 2010 a doped horse was run. It won and through the corrupt arrangements made between Mr Russo and Mr Bentley the fact that the horse had been doped was hidden. On eight other occasions similar things occurred. It is not necessary to go through the facts of each individual offence. What happened was broadly similar to what I have just described, although in some cases the purpose of ensuring that the horse was not tested was not because the horse had been doped with something like a milkshake, it was to ensure that other substances which had been administered to the horse, such as painkilling medication would not be detected.

7The offences were committed by the offender on 8 March 2010, 24 May 2010, 11 October 2010, 27 December 2010, 10 March 2011, 1 July 2011, 4 August 2011, 20 July 2011 and 27 July 2011. 

8It was not always Mr Bentley who was the corrupt steward either. Another corrupt steward, Paul O'Toole, was the recipient of money from the offender on some occasions for doing what I have earlier described, namely ensuring that particular horses were not tested.

9The offender was arrested on Thursday 24 November 2011. He was interviewed and I gather it is accepted now that he did not tell the truth to the police. He said, for example, that he did not administer bicarbonate of soda to his horses but put it in their feed only to encourage them to drink. He claimed that he did not know that the substance could have any other more positive effect on a horse's performance while running.

10The offender comes before me as a man of otherwise good character with one qualification. On 24 September 2009 he had been put on a s 10 bond for twelve months for a special range PCA matter. Although it is a matter of aggravation that he was on a bond at the time, because of the period of time which had elapsed before the offender committed the first of these offences and because the bond was for an offence quite different in criminality from those I have just described, the fact that he was on a bond will make no difference to the sentence that I am ultimately going to impose. 

11The offender has a close relationship with his family. He had a stable upbringing. He continues to live with his parents. He has a partner who he plans to marry in the future. As well as training horses, which got him involved in these offences, he works in the family fruit and vegetable business. He continues to do that to this day. He does not have any history of alcohol abuse or abuse of illegal drugs and so what led to him committing these offences cannot be explained by any deficiency in the way he was brought up. He only has himself to blame for the predicament in which he now finds himself. 

12The offender told Probation and Parole that the offences were not for financial gain although, clearly, as Mr Bunton who appears for the offender now accepts, they were. The offender also told Probation and Parole that his prime motivation for committing these offences was to enhance his reputation as a trainer. If horses that he was training were winning regularly then of course his reputation as a trainer would be increased. It really matters not whether Mr Russo's motivation was direct rewards through prize money paid when his horses won, or indirectly because he wanted to be known as a top class trainer - the point was that Mr Russo was prepared to gain those advantages through improper means and to cover them up through seriously criminal corrupt behaviour. 

13The offender says that he is remorseful in a letter tendered today to me, to which the Crown did not object. He says that he has only recently learned how the trotting industry has been greatly harmed by his behaviour. He understands that he will not be involved in the trotting industry for some time, if ever again. This is a matter that he feels deeply because he has had a passion for the sport, he says, for as long as he can remember with both his father and uncle being involved in the trotting industry.

14The one matter of some significance that Mr Bunton is able to call in aid in the offender's favour, concerns what has happened to the offender's co-offenders. As I mentioned, one of them got an immunity from prosecution, but that is not a matter that should affect the sentence that I impose upon the offender. The principles of parity do not extend to a consideration of Prosecution decisions as to who will be granted an immunity and who will not. I should also say that although I described the decision not to prosecute Mr Bentley as amazing earlier in these remarks on sentence, I do acknowledge that I do not know everything behind this case and I actually mean no criticism of the prosecuting authorities in what I have said. 

15Others have been dealt with in the Local Court, but unfortunately for the offender, in terms of parity, there are significant differences between them and him. In particular, fewer offences were committed and over a much shorter period of time. On top of that, one of them, Dean Atkinson, assisted the harness racing authorities, by confessing his involvement and providing information to them, which was a matter that, of course, was significantly taken into account in his favour. Information about the other co-offender who has been sentenced in the Local Court, Jay Fitzpatrick, is limited indeed. 

16There are significant impediments to understanding why it is that each received community service, and thus there are significant impediments to the offender in attempting to demonstrate that he would have a justifiable sense of grievance when he compares the sentence that he will receive from me with the sentence that was imposed upon them in the Local Court.

17Mr Bunton correctly concedes that imprisonment is required, but seeks to persuade me that a sentence not involving fulltime custody is appropriate. The Crown seeks a sentence of fulltime custody. Once the decision is made that imprisonment is required, fully accepting a sentence of imprisonment is a sentence of last resort, the question becomes how long should that sentence be and if there are no alternatives to fulltime custody because of the length of the sentence chosen, then that is the inevitable outcome. 

18It is clear general deterrence must play a major role in the sentence I am about to announce. Often sentences are imposed upon a person when the only people in court are the offender, court staff and two lawyers. General deterrence still has a role to play in that case but it will have some significant effect I trust in the present case. I have no doubt some publicity will be given within the harness racing industry to the sentence I am about to impose upon Mr Russo. I emphasise immediately that does not mean he will get a harsher sentence. No one should get a more severe sentence simply because there will be publicity given to it. All I am trying to say is that because of the narrow field in which these offences were committed, the sentence I have chosen to impose upon the offender will have the effect, I trust, of causing others who might be tempted to act in the way Mr Russo did, to wonder what will happen to them if they too are detected as being involved in corruption of this kind. 

19There is a tendency to underestimate the criminality of corruption of this nature. There is no identifiable victim, there is no victim impact statement read by a victim in tears and there is no particular person one can look at in a statement of facts and consider how awful the effects of a crime upon that person have been. So the lack of personal consequences of that kind can sometimes lead to the criminality of conduct like this being underestimated. But in truth, it is significantly criminal behaviour to do what the offender did. He has been involved in corruption with someone who was given a high level of trust. It was Mr Bentley's and Mr O'Toole's job to prevent precisely what Mr Russo was doing. To be involved with people of that kind affects the harness racing industry at a very basic level. The harm is diverse; many people suffer rather than just one identifiable victim. I mentioned before the Court of Criminal Appeal decision in Potter. That decision has demonstrated how serious corruption involving stewards in the racing industry is. 

20The question of concurrency and accumulation arises. Correctly, Mr Bunton realises I should not impose wholly concurrent sentences, but nor should I impose nine individual sentences which have the effect of imposing a longer sentence on the offender than the principle of totality requires. There is a somewhat arbitrary approach required. I will impose a longer sentence on count 1 because of the presence of the two Form 1 matters. There will be partial accumulation of other sentences upon those but I will group those other sentences into two groups. I will make a finding of special circumstances in the offender's favour, not because I think he is likely to do this in the future but because this is his first time in custody. He will be assisted by the provision of supervision by the Probation and Parole Service as he returns to freedom at the end of the effective non-parole period I am about to announce. 

21 For charges 2 to 5, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of nine months and a head sentence of one year to commence 1 March 2013. 

22For charges 6 to 9, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of six months and a head sentence of one year to commence on 1 September 2013. 

23For charge 1, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of three months to commence on 1 March 2014 and a head sentence of eighteen months. 

24The overall sentence consists of a non-parole period of fifteen months with a head sentence of thirty months. I direct the offender is to be released to parole on 31 May 2014.

		26 April 2013",2013-02-28 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2707083,R v Dimitri DE ANGELIS [2013] NSWDC 79,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE

1I am sentencing a man who defrauded over a dozen people - over some four years - of amounts totalling over $8,000,000. The man's name is Dimitri De Angelis. What I will do first is to set out the offences that I am sentencing him for. I will formally convict him of those offences then I will say something about what he did to bring about the charges against him. I will then say something, as a judge must, about the personal circumstances of Mr De Angelis, the offender. I will canvass the arguments put by the prosecution and the defence and, finally, I will sentence Mr De Angelis. 

2Mr De Angelis has pleaded guilty to 16 crimes. Fourteen of those crimes are offences against s 176A of the Crimes Act 1900. As it happens that section has since been repealed but it was the applicable law at the time. The maximum penalty provided by Parliament for such an offence is 10 years imprisonment. 

3I am also sentencing him for two offences of dishonestly obtaining for himself money by a deception. Once again that provision has been repealed but it was the law at the relevant time and that offence carries a maximum of 5 years imprisonment. 

4The list of offences, all 16 of them, are contained in an indictment signed by Mr M. G. O'Brien, the Crown Prosecutor who appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions in these sentence proceedings. When I am sentencing Mr De Angelis for the first offence in the indictment, he has asked me to take into account an additional charge which is also an offence under s 176A of the Crimes Act. He has signed a form provided for by s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, asking me to do that. I will take into account that offence when sentencing him for count 1 in the indictment and I have signed the form to that effect. 

5If I have not done so already, I formally convict Mr De Angelis of all 16 of the offences contained in the indictment which was dated 31 August 2012. 

6What Mr De Angelis did to bring about these charges is set out in exhibit A. Exhibit A is a folder entitled ""Agreed Facts"" and contains a 77 page document signed by Mr De Angelis as well as his legal representative and Mr O'Brien and dated 3 September 2012. It sets out in considerable detail all of the background to the various offences that he committed. 

7It is important to observe at this stage that I am sentencing him on the basis of those agreed facts. The Court of Criminal Appeal in this State has made it clear that the parties, and indeed to some extent the Judge, are bound by the facts which are agreed and tendered. I will draw on those agreed facts to briefly summarise what happened. 

8It is said that, in essence, ""through a series of false and misleading representations, the offender defrauded a number of persons"". Mr De Angelis did this by ""persuading those persons to put money into a company of which he was sole director. Through his false and misleading representations and conduct the offender lead those persons to believe that by investing their money in the company they were guaranteed to earn extraordinarily large amounts of money"". 

9There was indeed a company called Emporium Music Production and Distribution Pty Limited which was registered with the Australian Securities and Investment Commission on 5 February 2005. Mr De Angelis was the sole director, shareholder and secretary of that company. It was supposedly in the business of ""promoting singers, musicians and bands, and producing and distributing those artists' various recordings, in the form of CD's and DVDs"". 

10To various victims of his offences he made ""a series of false and misleading representations"". Some of those included the following:

He had built a corporate empire with a group of companies that he had incorporated in 2001, the Crystal Rights Group. 
That he had sold the Crystal Rights Group to the US corporation Wal-Mart for hundreds of millions of dollars which meant that he had access to those vast amounts of money. 
He knew and was good friends with many important and famous persons throughout Australia and the world. 
He justified that last representation by producing false photographs made using a computer program called Photoshop. The photographs depicted himself with no lesser persons than Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, His Holiness Pope John Paul II, His Holiness the Dalai Lama, US Presidents George Bush Senior, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton and Australian Prime Ministers John Howard and Kevin Rudd. The photographs extended to persons in significant positions in private enterprise including Gail Kelly, Kerry and James Packer and Lachlan Murdoch. 

11Mr De Angelis had falsified ASIC documents, including documents that made it appear that Lachlan Murdoch and James Packer had made large investments in his enterprise and were shareholders. He represented to people that he owned fleets of luxury cars, as well as mansions and luxurious homes in Sydney and Melbourne. 

12Part of the proposition that he put to potential investors was that every one per cent investment in his company would be worth $6,000,000 when the company went public. He represented that the purported float was to be underwritten by Macquarie Bank and was being administered by Deloittes. The facts record that Mr De Angelis ""persuaded persons to transfer and pay more than $8,500,000 to himself and to the company or its associated company Emporium Film Pty Limited"". 

13The agreed facts record the prosecution allegation that other than making a show of promoting some artists and producing and distributing some recordings ""the company had no real business dealings"". It was often, so far as a corporation is concerned, in financial crisis. The company I am referring to is Emporium Music Production and Distribution Pty Limited. The facts record illustrations of the company being in a financial crisis, including bank statements showing its balances often being close to zero and tax records showing the company made no money and always ran at a loss. 

14The company failed to pay many of its creditors or to meet contractual obligations to some of the artists. Over a three year period from June 2006 to June 2009 over $7,500,000 was paid into either Mr De Angelis' account or the company's account. Of that amount $2,621,646.60 was withdrawn in cash. Over $2,225,000 was systematically transferred directly from the company's account to Mr De Angelis's personal account. A further $2,239,653.58 was withdrawn from Mr De Angelis's personal account using Visa cards for a combination of personal use and company business. 

15I will say something briefly about each of the offences without going into the same detail which is recorded in the agreed facts. Count 1 is a charge under s 176A of the Crimes Act and the victim is Stewart Fish. Mr Fish was also the victim of count 2, which was an offence under s 178BA(1) of the Crimes Act. Mr De Angelis met Mr Fish in 2004 when Mr De Angelis used to attend Mr Fish's restaurant. They struck up a friendship. Part of the deception perpetrated on Mr Fish involved the rental of a penthouse suite in Melbourne. Mr Fish provided a statement which became part of exhibit B. So far as the first offence was concerned Mr Fish lost $700,000. So far as count 2 was concerned Mr Fish lost $80,000. In his statement Mr Fish said that as a result of Mr De Angelis's actions ""I have suffered financially and emotionally and am in fact still suffering substantially today."" He went on to say that ""the hardest part is knowing that I was made to believe that De Angelis was a good and close friend, only to find that he had inveigled himself into my life so as to defraud me of so much of my money."" 

16That process of inveigling himself into other people's lives is a feature of the way that Mr De Angelis went about committing these crimes. 

17The victims of the third count - which is a count under s 176A of the Crimes Act - were Marcelle Hoff and John Hoff. Mr De Angelis defrauded them of no less than $1,010,000. They are a married couple and Marcelle Hoff was, at the relevant time, an independent councillor with the City of Sydney Council. The fraud perpetrated on the Hoffs included Mr De Angelis doing things such as developing a website, preparing shareholding and loan agreements, persistent emails and text messages and renting an office in Chifley Square. He also manufactured false documentation. The Hoffs invested part of their retirement plan essentially into Mr De Angelis's own pocket. 

18The victim of count 4 is a man named Peter Steane. Mr De Angelis told Mr Steane that he, Mr De Angelis, ""was a successful banker, businessman and entrepreneur"". They met one New Year's Eve on a yacht which Mr De Angelis told Mr Steane that he, Mr De Angelis, owned. Mr Steane was also an academic at Macquarie University and in February 2005 Mr Steane ""invited the offender to speak to a group of MBA students about leadership"". In the lecture Mr De Angelis apparently ""described owning many companies"". 

19For the purposes of defrauding Mr Steane of $195,000 Mr De Angelis, as I said, had rented a yacht one New Years Eve and entertained lavishly. He had produced business cards and also sent Mr Steane emails giving him the impression that he, Mr De Angelis, was connected with the chairman or CEO of Citibank based in New York. In addition, as I said, he accepted the invitation to speak to the university students. 

20Count number 5 is also a count under s 176A of the Crimes Act and involves him defrauding Caroline Thompson of $90,000. She had been invited to a beach house at Wombarra. She was told by Mr De Angelis that he owned the house. Ms Thompson, when she went to the house, saw Rolls Royce, Ferrari and BMW cars parked in the driveway. Mr De Angelis told her that he owned them. In order to obtain money to invest in Mr De Angelis's companies Ms Thompson ""re-mortgaged her house with a loan through AMP"". Involved in the deception of Ms Thompson was Mr De Angelis engaging in hiring numerous very expensive makes of cars and manufacturing false banking documents. He even accepted an invitation to visit a secondary school where he handed out CD's. 

21Count 6 alleges that Mr De Angelis defrauded Anne Keating of $100,000. He had met her in 2004 and she had invited him to her unit. That occurred in these circumstances. Ms Keating apparently received a call from the concierge in her unit on behalf of Mr De Angelis ""asking whether the apartment was available for rent"". The concierge brought the offender to her apartment. Mr De Angelis told Ms Keating ""he was anxious to rent her apartment for his mother who would soon arrive from France for a few weeks."" Mr De Angelis told Ms Keating that he owned 17 apartments. He pointed to a contract for sale of land. This was his means of introducing himself to Ms Keating and inveigling himself into her life. As I said, he manufactured a false contract for sale of land. He rented expensive rural or beach recreational properties. He manufactured false flight bookings. Indeed at one stage he repaid Anne Keating $450,000 which she had lent him, thereby giving the impression that he was genuinely financially responsible when in fact he had taken the money from somebody else in order to repay her. What I have just described are all attributes of the activity that Mr De Angelis engaged in in order to defraud Anne Keating of $100,000. 

22The victim of count 7 was a man named Dev Mookerjee. He was defrauded of some $50,000 which amounted to an offence under s 176A of the Crimes Act, as was count 6 as well. Mr Mookerjee, as it turned out, ""was one of the students who attended the speech the offender was invited to give on strategic management"". In describing the facts of that count, Peter Steane, who was the victim of count 4, is referred to as ""Professor Peter Steane"". Mr Mookerjee, two years later, contacted Mr De Angelis about a business deal which he, Mr Mookerjee, had. Mr Mookerjee was just seeking advice. Mr De Angelis could not resist this opportunity and told Mr Mookerjee that he could invest in his company. Mr Mookerjee said that ""he only had $50,000 which was to be used as the deposit on a house"". The kinds of things which Mr De Angelis engaged in to defraud Mr Mookerjee included attending Mr Mookerjee's wedding and providing four Rolls Royce cars as transport for him and his bride and the wedding party. In addition he had also rented an expensive apartment in Sydney. Given the way Mr De Angelis met Mr Mookerjee and the source of the funds, namely a home deposit, which were available to Mr Mookerjee, I regard this offence as particularly heartless in a series of heartless offences. 

23Offence number 8 is also an offence under s 176A of the Crimes Act and involves Mr De Angelis defrauding Andrew Achilleos of $130,000. Mr Achilleos was the owner of a small Sydney limousine company. He drove Mr De Angelis to the airport on one occasion and received a text message from him a few weeks later. He invited him to invest $100,000 in the company and told him that a two per cent stake would be worth about $3,000,000. He showed Mr Achilleos pictures of himself with people such as Anne Keating, Paul Keating, John Howard and Vladamir Putin. The agreed facts go on to quote that Mr De Angelis was ""very persistent and persuasive and in May 2006 Mr Achilleos invested $100,000 for a two per cent shareholding in the company"". The money which Mr Achilleos paid into the company came from ""the sale of his home after a divorce settlement."" The facts go on to record that Mr Achilleos ""will now have to rent for the rest of his life"". Mr De Angelis presented Mr Achilleos with a loan agreement which gave the impression of safeguarding his investment. 

24At this stage I depart from the recitation of the various offences to return to count 5 which is the offence involving Caroline Thompson. A statement by her has been tendered which became part of exhibit B. She met Mr De Angelis just after her mother had died. She said she was not in a position to invest in Mr De Angelis' company, so she ""borrowed the money against my home in Scarborough"", which is a suburb of Perth. Her son, she points out, did not trust Mr De Angelis and ""begged me not to do it"". She points out that this has ""caused consistent rift between us and he has never forgiven me for losing the money"". She goes on to say that the loss of the money ($90,000) ""created financial hardship, as I now owe a lot of money on the home in Scarborough"". She said that the whole experience unsurprisingly ""has had a devastating effect on my ability to trust or take risks in business ventures, not to mention my finances and relationships"". She described Mr De Angelis as ""very organised, charming, clever and obviously planned"" in perpetrating his scam. 

25Count 9 is also an offence under s 176A of the Crimes Act and involves Mr De Angelis defrauding Jayne Gregory of $1,040,040. Jayne Gregory was at the relevant time a solicitor and lived in Melbourne. Mr De Angelis made a large number of representations to Ms Gregory, which are set out in the agreed facts. He claimed that he owned luxury homes and that she must transfer the amount of money for her investment by a particular time, thereby putting pressure on her. He said that he had not taken any of the money out by way of salary from the company. He claimed to own a car hire business and also suggested that he was contacting her from the office of the CEO or chairman of Citibank in New York City. 

26The fraud committed against Ms Gregory illustrates Mr De Angelis' capacity to put a large amount of pressure on some of his victims to make hasty decisions. As a result of the pressure and his persuasion, Ms Gregory, as I say, transferred some $1,040,000, not $1,040,040 as I said earlier, which essentially went into Mr De Angelis' own pocket. 

27The victim of count 10 was a Victorian silk, Graeme Uren QC, who is Jayne Gregory's partner. Mr De Angelis defrauded Mr Uren of some $20,000. Mr Uren persisted in asking Mr De Angelis for a prospectus, which was not produced, and Mr De Angelis kept promising him one. Again Mr De Angelis gave the impression of using the e-mail of the chairman of Citibank in New York City. 

28The victims of counts 11 and 12 are Kevin and Jennifer Winward. They are both offences - as were the offences as against Mr Uren and Ms Gregory - against s176A of the Crimes Act. Count 11 involves Mr De Angelis defrauding the Winwards of no less than $2,075,000 and count 12 involves a fraud of $700,000. The agreed facts point out that the Winwards were owners of a company structure ""for superannuation and investment purposes"". It appeared to be a family superannuation company which involved their adult sons as well. Mr Winward at one stage said that ""he and his wife were 'pretty naïve' as they had never been involved in an investment such as this before and needed to understand the processes involved"". 

29The activity involved in defrauding the Winwards of this huge amount of money involved preying upon them through a contact which Mr De Angelis had in Melbourne. He persuaded them to part with superannuation funds which had been set up for themselves and their sons. He continued to prey on them despite them acknowledging that they were ""pretty naïve"". 

30The agreed facts also record this. In 2007 they were invited to the Presidential Suite at the Crown Casino in Melbourne by Mr De Angelis. There was a woman named Rhonda Wylie and several other people there as well including artists. The facts say that ""Jennifer Winward heard Rhonda Wylie say to the offender 'James Packer has arrived and wants to have dinner with you' to which he replied 'Tell him I'll see him for breakfast'. She later heard her tell the offender that 'Red' had arrived from Perth and also wanted to see him. She understood 'Red' to be a reference to Eileen Bond. The offender continued to order expensive bottles of champagne and buckets of caviar while they were there."" In addition, in order to assist him in defrauding the Winwards of so much money, he falsely manufactured Channel Ten logos to give the impression that he was associated with that corporation. At one stage the facts record that he ""bombarded"" the Winwards with SMS messages relating to the success of the company and its artists and pictures of himself with prominent people. 

31Count 13 is also an offence against s 176A and involves Mr De Angelis defrauding Assunta and Nuncio Pellicano of $950,000. Once again Mr De Angelis used the Presidential Suite at the Crown Casino and told the Pellicanos that he had been speaking to Lachlan Murdoch about an investment. He e-mailed a photograph of himself with Lachlan Murdoch and sent them a business plan. He also again gave the impression that he was contacting them from the office of the chairman of Citibank. He showed them a document which ""appeared to be an HSBC statement with a balance of approximately $145,000,000"". He told them he had a hundred employees and that he had a bodyguard. 

32Count 14 claims that Mr De Angelis defrauded Rex Growden of $1,300,000, thereby offending against s 176A of the Crimes Act. The facts record that ""Rex Growden and his wife met the offender while they were eating at a Sydney restaurant when he began talking to them from his table nearby"". He sent them numerous SMS messages attaching the usual photographs. He made extraordinary claims about his company and the prospects of investing. Again he told them of associations with Lachlan Murdoch and James Packer. Mr Growden ""told the offender that the money would be paid out of his superannuation account, with his son Simon Growden acting as his financial adviser, so they needed to ensure that all documentation et cetera was finalised"". He sent them an e-mail attaching ""an ASIC search document which appeared to indicate that the offender, James Packer and Lachlan Murdoch were sole shareholders in a company called Emporium Pavicevic. (It should be noted that Mr De Angelis is also known as Slobodan Pavicevic.) He even sent a text message to Mr Growden addressing him as James thereby giving him the impression that he was sending a text to James Packer. Again he used the Channel Ten logo. 

33Hence count 14 involved him preying on people to whom he introduced himself gratuitously in a public place. He allowed them to invest superannuation funds. He manufactured an ASIC document which was false and gave the impression of being connected to James Packer. 

34The final two offences are counts 15 and 16. They involve a victim named Lorraine Velichkovich. Count 15 is the second of the two charges under s 178BA(1) of the Crimes Act and asserts that by deception Mr De Angelis dishonestly obtained $50,000 from Lorraine Velichkovich. Count 16 is a charge under s 176A of the Crimes Act and involves defrauding her of $277,000. 

35Mr De Angelis met Ms Velichkovich in 2004 in Scarborough, Western Australia. Again he began speaking to her in a café where she was dining with a friend who knew Mr De Angelis. He took her to a penthouse where he was staying and they stayed on for drinks. He induced her to come across to Sydney. Ms Velichkovich took out a mortgage on her home in order to invest funds in Mr De Angelis' proposed investment. He even suggested that she move to Sydney from Perth and she agreed to sell her apartment. This she did and she moved to Sydney. Mr De Angelis organised for her to rent an apartment. The facts go on to record that just after ""she had sold her apartment the offender told her she could purchase another five per cent share in Emporium for $100,000"". Accordingly she invested more than that amount. All in all, as I said, Ms Velichkovich invested $277,000 as well as an amount of $50,000. 

36Again Mr De Angelis had preyed on a stranger whom he had met, admittedly through somebody else, in a public place and persuaded her to sell her apartment and move interstate where he relieved her of more funds. She had also sold her business. He allowed her to sell her own business so she could work with him. 

37I turn now to some personal information about Mr De Angelis. The information is limited. One source is a very helpful report from the experienced forensic psychiatrist, Dr Stephen Allnutt, who produced a report dated 24 December 2012 and who gave evidence before me on 23 January this year. Dr Allnutt had interviewed Mr De Angelis a number of times and had reviewed a large amount of information about Mr De Angelis's medical background, including treatment at various stages under psychiatrists and some admissions to hospital. In his report, which became exhibit 2, he said:
""The varied clinical opinions in my view reflect the difficulty in this case; this is a man who has pled guilty to engaging in a large fraud of various experienced people who has a tendency to exaggerate his achievements (having regard to the documentation from Wikipedia that was amongst the evidence); this would suggest an underlying tendency to fabricate his history and information about himself to meet secondary gains; given that he is now facing charges and sentencing for these offences, it would be reasonable for clinicians to be concerned that his self report of symptoms might be unreliable.""

Dr Allnutt fairly added that on the other hand:
""People who are fraudulent have the same risk of mental illness as the general population and this needs to be considered in this case.""

38I add here that of course any history which comes directly from Mr De Angelis I regard as unreliable unless corroborated, for the reasons stated by Dr Allnutt.

39Mr De Angelis did not go into the witness box to give evidence. That does not make the situation worse for him on sentence, but it does deprive him of an opportunity of giving evidence under oath or affirmation whereby he could be cross-examined by the Crown Prosecutor and give evidence of matters such as contrition and his own personal history. As was pointed out by Mr M. C. Ramage QC, who later appeared for Mr De Angelis, he is not prejudiced by not going into the witness box but, as I say, he loses an advantage which he might have otherwise had. 

40Dr Allnutt went on to say he was ""reasonably confident of a current diagnosis of mood disorder, predominantly recurrent depressive disorder and anxiety disorder (with panic attacks) with a vulnerability to periods of hypomania; differential diagnosis includes bipolar affective disorder"". Dr Allnutt said he was ""unable to conclude a diagnosis of chronic psychotic disorder"" although he was reluctant to definitively rule it out. He thought specifically the applicable diagnosis was one of narcissistic personality disorder. 

41Dr Allnutt ventured an opinion about Mr De Angelis's mental state around the time of offending. He was not seeing Mr De Angelis at the time and had to draw on Mr De Angelis's history and also evidence from other medical sources. He said he was ""unable to conclude that he was driven by an underlying delusional motivation"". He was of the opinion that a ""significant feature that would have made impact on his offending behaviour would have been his underlying personality disorder which could be regarded as being a narcissistic personality disorder suffered by an individual with a poor self identity and self esteem derived from early abusive experiences in childhood; his offending could be seen in terms of an attempt to achieve success, not only for financial gain (secondary gain) but also an attempt to shore up an underdeveloped sense of self and self esteem (primary gain)."" 

42I am inclined to accept the noted history of early abusive experiences in childhood because they are consistent with evidence that in his infancy in France he was transferred into State care and spent time in State care until he became an adult. 

43Dr Allnutt noted that from 2009 until he was arrested in 2010 Mr De Angelis's mental state was of some concern to various doctors. It had deteriorated and Dr Allnutt thought that might have been triggered ""by a number of factors including: prior cocaine abuse, realisation that his enterprise was failing and the death of this dog"". (That should read ""his dog"".) 

44Dr Allnutt confirmed in evidence before me his diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder. In cross-examination he said the offences which Mr De Angelis committed required reasonable judgment. He acknowledged it was a difficult case to express an opinion on because of the volume of information and documents and was ""clouded by Mr De Angelis's unreliability in reporting"". Cocaine was a significant factor contributing to mood fluctuations. 

45There were put into evidence various character references from people who appeared to know Mr De Angelis well. He is described, amongst other ways, as being a ""complex individual"". It was pointed out his life has been ""one of psychological torment, abuse and loneliness"". One person described him as a ""confused, at times volatile, generous and sadly, irreparably damaged individual who craves acceptance and love but who sadly has only created destruction around himself for financial gain and public exposure he yearns for but, unfortunately, for all the wrong reasons"". He is described as extremely kind hearted but with drastic outbursts ""of total disconnection, self destruction, outrageous behaviour"". He is said to show a genuine concern for those in need and the less fortunate in life and as being a person who is genuinely interested in people. I must take those character references in the context of my description of the offending which he has committed. 

46Exhibit 3 was the document which was from France and set out the fact that he was a ward of State from about the age of four until he was about 19. 

47I turn now to consider arguments put forward by Mr O'Brien and Mr Ramage QC as to matters which should affect the sentence. I must accept there was, as Mr Ramage QC argues, some genuine attempt to set up a record label, to produce CDs and to promote artists. A reading of the agreed facts shows such attempts were almost lost in the extensive fraud perpetrated on the victims. His lifestyle, as Mr Ramage QC pointed out, had to show the trappings of success but he was spending his victims' money on those trappings whilst telling them lies. 

48There was an issue about whether the harm perpetrated to victims who are natural persons should be given more weight than the harm perpetrated against a corporation. The relevance of the issue to this case was the reference to various authorities which Mr O'Brien said often concerned corporations and I should regard the sentences imposed in those other cases as being based upon damage done to corporations rather than to natural persons. Mr Ramage QC argued there should be no distinction. I find as a matter of fact the impact on victims who are natural persons is worse than on a victim which is a large corporation. One is a real person; the other is a legal person. The shareholders are affected by the impact on a corporation but the impact there is indirect. As Mr O'Brien pointed out, the impact is literally shared by the shareholders. 

49Mr Ramage QC pointed to the sophistication of some of the victims and argued there was nothing particularly sophisticated about his client's conduct. I reject the latter submission. His client went to extraordinary lengths to present himself as a successful, experienced and well-connected company director and entrepreneur. Those efforts were very worthwhile in extracting millions of dollars from innocent victims who thought they were investors. They were very effective in persuading experienced and professional people. To defraud a couple of unsophisticated victims might not need much skill; to defraud 16 unsophisticated victims would need an adept fraudster; but to defraud 16 victims, some of whom were are in professional, academic, business or local government careers for a period of over some years, requires very skilled criminal craft and perseverance. Mr De Angelis demonstrated that. 

50As Mr Ramage QC says, his client made some extraordinarily, perhaps occasionally bizarre, claims. But Mr De Angelis went to a lot of trouble to make those claims convincing. The enterprise which Mr De Angelis engaged in over some four years, speaking generally, required hard work, co-ordination, preparation, perseverance, extravagance, ruthlessness, exploitation of friendships, deviousness, cunning, heartlessness and intelligence. He was, after all, dealing with intelligent and sometimes professional people. His fraudulent behaviour involved a very large logistical exercise. It was not only fraudulent, it was predatory. He had to use great skill in forging or in arranging the forging of documents, including photographs. 

51I accept Mr Ramage QC's submissions there are special circumstances for adjusting the normal relationship in a sentence between the non-parole period and the head sentence. When someone is sentenced to gaol the non parole period is fixed according to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to being 75 per cent of the head sentence. For example, if someone were sentenced to 4 years imprisonment the non-parole period would be 3 years imprisonment. In special circumstances a judge can alter the relationship so the parole period is longer, thereby reducing the non-parole period. 

52Mr Ramage QC points to his client's mental health condition as being a special circumstance. I accept that submission. He also pointed to the fact it was his client's first time in custody. I accept that. He pointed to bail conditions his client had been subject to as being very onerous. I do not regard that as being particularly significant given the length of the sentence I will have to impose. He also referred me to what the Court of Criminal Appeal had said in Heather Kathleen Power v Regina [2002] NSWCCA 244 as being relevant to the sentencing of what are called white collar criminals. Mr De Angelis falls into such a category, which is not unusual. He has no record of criminal convictions. The Court of Criminal Appeal in Power at [38] said this:
""In Corbett 52 A Crim R 112 at 117 this Court, comprising Gleeson CJ, Priestley JA and Matthews J, understandably said: 

'Nevertheless, a feature of past sentencing for 'white collar' crimes involving fraudulent abuse of trust, and sometimes involving fraud on the public purse, has been the imposition of lengthy head sentences, but with a substantial gap between head sentence and non-parole periods or minimum terms. This has probably been the consequence of a desire on the part of the courts, on the one hand, to reflect the need for general deterrence and, on the other hand, to give due account to the fact that the offenders involved frequently have no prior criminal history, are not likely to re-offend, and have good prospects of rehabilitation.'

Although Mr De Angelis has no prior criminal history I am not able to make a clear finding about him being unlikely to re-offend or good prospects of rehabilitation. 

53Mr Ramage QC referred me to the sentencing of Shawn Richard by Garling J in the Supreme Court on 12 August 2011: see [2011] NSWSC 866. Garling J observed at [71] in that case (which involved superannuation funds) that such funds ""represent an important and significant element in the financial system in Australia and in ensuring its economic and financial stability. Superannuation monies represent the savings of individual members of the community which are intended to provide a secure retirement fund.""

54Mr Ramage QC wanted to draw some comfort from the sentences imposed by his Honour in that case. But his Honour was sentencing Mr Richard for only two offences, each of them carrying a maximum of 5 years imprisonment. 

55Mr Ramage QC argued that the offending of his client could be seen as one episode of an ongoing criminal enterprise. There is some force in that argument but what is more significant is the number of individual victims which that criminal enterprise impacted upon. 

56There is no significant evidence of any contrition. 

57Mr Ramage QC argued that because of his client's plea of guilty the sentence should be discounted. Mr O'Brien acknowledged the sentence could be discounted but they disagreed by how much. The Court of Criminal Appeal has indicated that for a plea of guilty at the earliest available opportunity a sentence may be discounted by some 25 per cent. Mr Ramage QC sought to persuade me that his client should receive up to 25 per cent. Mr O'Brien on the other hand argued the discount should be only in the region of 10 to 15 per cent. 

58MFI 1 in these proceedings is a chronology of the sequence of events involved in Mr De Angelis pleading guilty. On 9 December 2011 the Chief Judge of this Court listed Mr De Angelis's prosecution for trial. The date fixed was 30 July 2012. The question of fitness was mentioned on 9 December 2011. The estimate for the length of the trial was some three months but it was not until three days before the trial, namely 27 July 2012, that a serious question of Mr De Angelis's fitness for trial was raised. That led to a fitness hearing during August. Once Judge Marien SC found Mr De Angelis fit for trial he entered a plea of guilty a few days later, on 3 September 2012; in fact 10 days later. Although there has been a significant saving of time and resources which were not devoted to a trial, the Director of Public Prosecutions had to be ready to proceed until a few days before the trial. Some of the victims, Mr O'Brien points out, are from interstate. 

59Mr Ramage QC's argument is I should discount the sentence by 25 per cent because there is no delay after his client was found fit. He also pointed out his client had agreed with the complex statement of the facts. Mr O'Brien says the range is 10 to 15 per cent and should be fixed closer to 10 per cent. He argues it was a very late plea and that must impact on its utilitarian value which is the kind of discount I am considering at this stage. I have taken into account what Howie J said about the principles governing a discount for a plea of guilty in R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; (2009) 52 MVR 528 at [32]. Although there was a good deal of practical value in the saving of the trial and the agreement to the facts, the plea was very late and, as Howie J pointed out by reference to authority:
""The utilitarian value of the pleas will be determined largely by the timing of the plea so that the earlier the plea the greater the discount."" 

60I regard an appropriate discount for the pleas of guilty as being one of 12½ per cent. 

61A number of arguments were directed to the provisions of s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. That is a provision which sets out factors that are described as aggravating factors to be taken into account in determining an appropriate sentence. There was an argument about the applicability of cl (k) about whether Mr De Angelis abused a position of trust or authority. I do not accept that I should take into account as a separate aggravating feature under s 21A an abuse of a position of trust or authority. The frauds were committed by him as a director. That itself involves a breach of trust so I already take it into account in sentencing him for the offence expressed in its terms that there has been a breach of trust. I do not accept that the offence was aggravated because of a breach of trust in the relationships involved. Many frauds must involve a violation of trust, which is part of the relationship. 

62Mr De Angelis was himself not a professional person such as a solicitor or an accountant. I have taken into account what the Court of Criminal Appeal said in R v Giam (No.2) (1999) 109 A Crim R 348 at [27] (Dunford J) and R v Carr (2003) 135 A Crim R 171 (Howie J at [31]). 

63Another issue was whether the victims would fall into the category of cl (l) of being vulnerable - as the provision says - because they were ""very young or very old or had a disability, or because of the victim's occupation"". I do not think any of the victims fall within this provision. Some were more pliable than others and Mr De Angelis took advantage of that. I regard the pliability of victims not as an especially aggravating feature under s 21A, but one to be taken into account in assessing the objective seriousness of each respective offence. I regard the offence involving Dev Mookerjee, as I said, as more serious in a sense than some of the others because he had met him in a teacher student relationship and, as the facts record, Mr Mookerjee drew on a deposit on his home and Mr De Angelis attended his wedding. 

64Mr Ramage QC sensibly and obviously concedes the offences were part of planned or organised criminal activity in accordance with cl (n) and this is a feature which aggravates all of them. I do not regard cl (o) as applicable - being committed for financial gain. That is because almost all frauds would be committed for financial gain, so it is not a separately aggravating factor. I do regard cl (m) as applicable as the offences involved a series of criminal acts. Cl (m) is applicable because although there were multiple victims there is a separate charge for each of them. The fact there are multiple victims is not itself an aggravating feature, but each of the offences involved a series of criminal acts. Some of them constitute quite complex steps in the deception involved. 

65I have regard to what the Court of Criminal Appeal said in R v Tadrosse [2005] NSWCCA 145. As Howie J said in that case, an aggravating factor as referred to in s 21A ""is something that operates over and above the general considerations that indicate that a particular class of offending should generally be dealt with in a particular way"". (That was in [25].) The offences in this case, as I said, involve notions of breach of trust and financial gain. 

66Mr O'Brien, in his helpful written submissions, drew my attention to various decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal dealing with matters of fraud. I have had particular regard to the sentences imposed in Giam (No.2) (1999) 109 A Crim R 348, Jackson [2001] NSWCCA 355, Mungomery [2004] NSWCCA 450 and Gomes [2008] NSWCCA 142. All of those cases concerned offences under s 176A of the Crimes Act. I have also had regard to those cases which record sentences for offences against s 178BA of the same Act. 

67I propose to sentence Mr De Angelis by imposing an aggregate sentence of imprisonment in respect of all of the offences. In accordance with s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act I propose to indicate the sentences which would have been imposed in respect of each offence. There will be a large degree of concurrence in these offences. 

68General deterrence is obviously a very significant factor in my sentencing as well as community protection and recognition of the harm done to the victims. In accordance with the authorities I regard two of the most important features in sentencing for each offence as being the amount involved in the fraud and the period of time over which the fraud was committed. I refer to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Mungomery. 

69I turn now to the various offences. I have taken into account in calculating my sentence, and I have to indicate each sentence, Mr De Angelis's mental health condition. It is relevant to his serving a term of imprisonment in that it means the imprisonment might be harder. It is relevant to some extent in general deterrence that a person with a mental health condition is not regarded by the authorities as a clear example of an offender which should be taken into account for general deterrence. In this regard I note he has not been diagnosed as having a psychosis but a personality disorder. In addition he was suffering to some extent whilst he was offending. 

70So far as count 1 is concerned, Mr Fish was relieved of $700,000 over a period of about 2 years and 5 months. I would regard an appropriate sentence as being one of 6 years imprisonment. I discount that by 12½ per cent and that would produce a sentence of 5 years and 3 months. 

71So far as count 2 is concerned - the offence against s 178BA carrying a maximum of 5 years imprisonment - that again involved Mr Fish over a period of about 4 months and an amount of $80,000. I would regard an appropriate sentence as being one of 2 years imprisonment reduced by 12½ per cent and that would produce a sentence of 1 year and 9 months. 

72Count 3, the offence involving Mr and Mrs Hoff, was committed over 4 years and 4 months and from them was taken $1,010,000. I would regard an appropriate sentence as being one of 7 years imprisonment. Discounted by 12½ per cent, an appropriate sentence would be 6 years imprisonment. 

73Count 4, involving Mr Steane, is under s 176A carrying a maximum of 10 years imprisonment. That involved an amount of $195,000 and was committed over 4 years and 5 months. The appropriate head sentence would be 5 years and after a discount of 12½ per cent that would be 4 years and 3 months. 

74Count 5 is another s 176A offence carrying a maximum of 10 years imprisonment. It involved $90,000 and Ms Thompson. It was committed over 4 years and 4 months. A sentence of 4½ years is appropriate, which I would reduce to 4 years after a discount of 12½ per cent. 

75Count 6 involving $100,000 and Ms Keating was committed over nearly 5 years. It is a 10 year maximum sentence. An appropriate penalty would be 4½ years imprisonment. I would discount that by 12½ per cent and reduce it to 4 years imprisonment. 

76In some instances, I should add, the discount I have applied reduces the sentences to slightly below the exact figure and occasionally slightly above. 

77Count 7, the offence involving Mr Mookerjee, is a s 176A offence. It was committed over 4 years and 4 months. I would regard an appropriate head sentence of being one of 5 years, which I would reduce to 4 years and 3 months after a discount of 12½ per cent. 

78Count 8, Mr Achilleos, was an offence involving $130,000 and was committed over 3 years and 4 months. That carried a 10 year maximum and I would regard an appropriate sentence as being one of 4½ years imprisonment. I would discount that to 4 years imprisonment after a 12½ per cent discount. 

79Count 9 involved Ms Gregory and was a s 176A offence. It involved $1,040,000 and was committed over 2½ years. A sentence of 6½ years is appropriate in that case which I would reduce to 5½ years after a discount of 12½ per cent.

80Count 10 involved Mr Uren QC and $20,000. It too was committed over 2½ years and carried a maximum of 10 years imprisonment. Four years is an appropriate sentence for that offence which I would reduce to 3½ years after a discount of 12½ per cent.

81Count 11 involved the Winwards and is a 10 year maximum sentence. That involved $2,075,000 and was committed over 2 years. I would regard an appropriate penalty as being one of 7½ years. I would reduce that to 6½ years after a discount of 12½ per cent.

82Count 12 again involved the Winwards and $700,000, an offence carrying a maximum of 10 years imprisonment. It was committed over a year and a half. Five and a half years is an appropriate sentence in that case but I would discount it by 12½ per cent to reduce it to 4½ years imprisonment. 

83Count 13 involved the Pellicanos and was a 10 year maximum offence. It involved $950,000 and was committed over 1 year and 8 months. I would regard an appropriate penalty as being one of 6 years imprisonment. I would reduce that to 5 years and 3 months after a discount of 12½ per cent. 

84Count 14 involved Mr Growden. it was a 10 year maximum offence and was committed over a period of a year. I would regard an appropriate penalty in that case as being one of 6½ years, which I would reduce to 5½ years after a discount of 12½ per cent. 

85Count 15 involves Ms Pavicevic and is the second s 178BA offence, carrying a maximum of 5 years imprisonment. The amount involved was $50,000 and a period of 3 months. An appropriate sentence in that case is 2 years imprisonment which I would reduce to 1 year and 9 months after discounting it by 12½ per cent. 

86The victim of count 16 is again Ms Pavicevic but is an offence under s 176A of the Crimes Act carrying a maximum of 10 years imprisonment. That was committed over a period of 4 years and 11 months. I would regard an appropriate sentence as being one of 5 years, which I discount by 12½ per cent to one of 4½ years imprisonment.

HIS HONOUR: Stand up Mr De Angelis. 

87It is obvious that if I imposed all of those sentences upon you, you would die in prison. I am not going to impose all of those sentences on you; I am going to impose one sentence on you. I am allowed to do that by s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I have indicated to you what the individual sentences would be. It is also obvious there must be a large telescoping in the sentence I impose. To impose a sentence which would be largely an accumulation or even a significant accumulation of those would result in a manifestly harsh and crushing sentence. Nevertheless, the sentence must serve the purposes which are set out. 

88I am going to sentence you to 12 years imprisonment and the non parole period will be 7½ years. It will date from 14 November 2012. I set the non-parole period of 7½ years to commence on 14 November 2012 and to expire on 13 May 2020. The balance of the term will be 4½ years commencing on 15 May 2020 and expiring on 13 November 2024. Have a seat for a moment Mr De Angelis.

HIS HONOUR: Mr O'Brien and Mr Harmsdorf, take your time.

O'BRIEN: You've got a day - you miss out a day I think your Honour. Non parole expires you said 13 May and then balance of term to start on 15 May. You've left out a day, so it should be the 14th.

89The balance of the term should commence 14 May 2020 and expire on 13 November 2024. 

HIS HONOUR: Take your time, check those and also check whether there have been any matters of fact or law which could be dealt with under s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 

O'BRIEN: As far as the Crown is concerned those figure are all accurate your Honour I think, thank you, and nothing else arising.

HARMSDORF: The figures seem to be quite all right to me and there's nothing arising.

90Mr De Angelis your sentence I have backdated to 14 November 2012 because you went into custody when I refused you bail on 4 December 12. You were also in custody between 20 March 2010 and 8 April 2010, which was about 20 days, so I have backdated it another 20 days from 4 December so that is why it commences on 14 November. It expires therefore 12 years later on 13 November 2024. Your non-parole period is 7½ years. If it had been 75 per cent it would have been a non-parole period of 9 years. I have made it a non-parole period of 7½ years because of the special circumstances which I have referred to. That non-parole period of 7½ years expires on 13 May 2020, so you will be eligible for release on 13 May 2020. The Parole Authority will consider your release before then and it is responsible for whether or not you are released on 13 May 2020. After you are released on parole you are still serving your sentence and under sentence until it expires on 13 November 2024, do you understand that?

OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.

7The aggregate sentence imposed by the District Court was of a non-parole period of 9 years commencing 21 October 2009 and expiring on 20 October 2018 as part of a head sentence of 13 years and 6 months expiring on 20 April 2023. 

8The applicant raises two grounds of appeal:

(i)Ground 1: The judge erred in failing properly to take into account evidence that the offences were committed in circumstances of duress and/or to determine whether mitigation of the sentences was warranted accordingly;

(ii)Ground 2: The aggregate sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust. 

Facts

9The sentence proceedings were conducted on the basis of agreed statement of facts. Further the applicant gave evidence in the sentence proceedings regarding the circumstances in which the offences were committed. The facts were summarised by the sentencing judge and are further summarised in the following manner.

10The applicant arrived in Australia from South America in early September 2009 with a return ticket for departure on 4 November 2009. The applicant rented a motel room and hired a car. There were a series of offences committed between 13 September and 21 October 2009 at fast-food restaurants. 

11The method of committing the offences was similar for each offence; namely, the applicant would cut cables and disarm alarms and CCTV cameras before entering the remainder of the premises. Significant damage was caused to the premises through, for example, the use of spray paint. Once entry was gained to the premises, the applicant would drill or cut into the safe and steal, or attempt to steal, cash from the safe. In total, $136,351 in cash was stolen. The money was deposited into several bank accounts in Panama and Australia. Only $35,200 of that amount has been recovered.

12The applicant gave evidence at the sentence proceedings to the effect that he had become heavily indebted through gambling. The applicant's creditor, who was associated with drug trafficking, had asked the applicant to act as a courier for drugs. The applicant was afraid and attempted to ""buy time"" before fleeing to Australia, with the intention that his wife would follow. 

13After leaving the country the applicant was informed that the creditor had threatened his wife. He could not think of any other way to ensure his wife's safety and so conceived the idea of committing the offences with which he was charged. The money was transferred to the bank accounts in Panama so that his wife would be able to access the money and pay the creditor. 

Other Subjective Circumstances 

14The applicant was 37 years of age at the time that he committed the offences and 39 years of age at the time that the sentence was imposed. He had a record of prior convictions in the United States of America. The record disclosed at least three offences of break, enter and steal and an offence of possessing burglary tools. 

15The applicant was born in Uruguay, but was raised in Cuba. Apparently, the family moved there at some stage, because his father was politically active and went into exile. He has one half-brother and two half-sisters. His parents separated when he was seven years of age. His mother now lives in Argentina and his father died about 11 or 12 years ago. 

16The applicant is married. Before coming to this country, as described above, the applicant and his wife lived in Panama. They have no children. 

17There was some disruption to his early life as a result of moving countries and the separation of his parents. There is also a suggestion of domestic violence in his youth. 

18There is no evidence of any drug or alcohol abuse problems from which the applicant suffers. According to the applicant's account, he started gambling at the age of 13, at a time when he would have been too young to appreciate the long-term consequences of that abuse.

19He claims an Associate Degree in Business Management and that he worked in various industries, including construction, hospitality and sales. He was working as an international executive salesperson at the time he left Panama.

20In his account of his history to his psychologist, Mr Tim Watson-Munro, Consultant Forensic Psychologist, he recounted that for a significant period of time he hid his long-standing addiction to gambling from his family and his wife. In his early years he was addicted to gambling and, as part of that addiction, gambled on horses, roulette, sports matches and poker machines.

21After a stint in the United States, the applicant returned to South America and his mother provided him with $380,000 to re-establish himself. Most, if not all, of this money was gambled and was lost in a very brief period of time and, his ability to cover such bets enabled him to gamble on credit to the point where he owed his creditors approximately $250,000.

22According to Mr Watson-Munro the applicant's problems with gambling were great and were reflected in substantial psychological symptoms, which were severely aggravated when his creditors started to put pressure on him to repay the debt. Mr Watson-Munro diagnosed the applicant as suffering from a Gambling Addiction and an Anxiety Disorder according to the criteria in DSM-IV.

23The applicant's symptomatology, according to Mr Watson-Munro, has been significantly aggravated by the dislocation and distance from his family in South America and his placement in a maximum security prison. Mr Watson-Munro also noted the applicant's expression of remorse. The Gambling Addiction was described as chronic.

24The sentencing judge was also satisfied that the applicant was remorseful (ROS 2) and noted that the applicant's mother was in poor health, which would, or might, affect her capacity to visit the applicant in custody in Australia. The sentencing judge concluded that the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation were reasonable and that he was unlikely to re-offend (ROS 9).

25Lastly, the judge found that special circumstances existed, having regard to the applicant's separation from his family while in custody and the need to accumulate the sentences (ROS 10).

Ground 1: Absence of regard for duress and consequent mitigation of sentences

26The applicant submits that the effect of his evidence was that the offences were committed in circumstances involving an element of duress. The applicant submits that the sentencing judge did not make a clear finding as to whether the applicant's evidence was accepted and, if so, whether and to what extent it warranted mitigation on sentence.

27The applicant submits that the circumstances outlined as to the gambling debt and threats to his family are relevant to the sentencing of the applicant and, if the sentencing judge were to have considered that the evidence should not have been accepted, then, in the interests of procedural fairness, notice should have been given to allow the opportunity to address further on the issue.

28As is conceded, the onus of proving duress (as so described by the applicant) rests upon the applicant: R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; (1999) 199 CLR 270 at 281; Chow v DPP (1992) 28 NSWLR 593 at [606]; R v Falls [2004] NSWCCA 335 at [35]. It is unclear what fact the applicant claims amounts to duress.

29If the ""duress"" were the addiction to gambling and the sizeable debt that was owed, then his Honour, the sentencing judge, plainly took account of that factor. If, on the other hand, the claimed duress were the threats to the life of his wife, then his Honour also dealt with that issue. His Honour took the view that the applicant bore the onus of proof, had not satisfied that burden, but that his Honour would take it into account in dealing with the matter.

30The sentencing judge, in his Remarks on Sentence, said:

""The explanation for not bringing his wife to this country does not ring true to the Court when the Court considers all the circumstances, including the size of the debt and his knowledge by that time that his creditor was involved in the illicit international drug trade. There is a compelling case in the Court's view, particularly when the Court considers how soon after he came to this country he started obtaining the equipment to commit these offences, that he came here for the purpose of committing these crimes. Whether that be the case or whether he decided upon that course shortly after arriving here does not make a great deal of difference to the Court's view in terms of his criminality.

...

The [applicant] claims that he committed the offences because his wife's life was in jeopardy because his creditor had located her and approached her on a number of occasions. It seems to the Court that he had two choices if one accepts his account: one was to go home where he appreciated that there was a risk that his creditor would embroil him in illicit activity on a long-term basis. He chose the lesser of two evils and committed his crimes in this country and did so appreciating there was a reasonable chance that he would be arrested and incarcerated here a long way away from his loved ones."" (ROS, page 7, 8-9.)

31His Honour was expressing the view that he accepted the fear and/or anxiety expressed by the applicant as to the threats to his wife. His Honour did not accept that there were no choices apart from the criminal activity in which the applicant engaged.

32In my view, the applicant had a number of choices. It is true he owed significant debt to persons who had no compunction in engaging in illegal activities. It is also true, on the evidence before the sentencing judge, that he considered his wife's life at risk.

33Nevertheless, the ""duress"", on which the applicant seeks to rely, is not duress causing him to behave in the way in which he has behaved. The applicant's choice to engage in the criminal activity was one of a number of choices available to him.

34The first, and most obvious, choice was to tell his family and friends of the debt and his gambling addiction. The Court is unaware of whether his family would have been able to meet the debt, either directly or by obtaining a loan. Given that his mother had provided $380,000 on an earlier occasion for him to be re-established in South America, it is not an unreasonable expectation that a further amount of money could have been forthcoming.

35On that basis, the requirement to undertake the criminal activity is caused more by the applicant's reluctance to disclose his gambling addiction, than by the threats by the persons to whom he owed money. I agree with the sentencing judge's assessment that choices, other than engaging in the criminal activity with which the applicant was charged, were available to the applicant and the ""duress"" claimed is of little consequence in assessing the sentence to be imposed.

36I also accept the reasonableness of the cynicism with which the sentencing judge approached the applicant's explanation for not bringing his wife to Australia. It seems, given the illegal activities of the persons to whom he owed a debt, the most obvious course was to bring his wife to Australia immediately and not engage in any criminal activity.

37As to the suggestion that the failure to find in favour of the applicant in relation to the question of duress required the sentencing judge to give the applicant a further opportunity to adduce evidence, that suggestion should be rejected. The facts were accepted by the court below and the court acted upon them. It is the significance of those facts which is truly in issue.

38It is the function of a court, or tribunal that is required to act judicially, to give each party before it an opportunity to prepare and to present the party's case adequately. It is not, and never has been, a requirement to give any party more than one such opportunity, when adequate opportunity has been given and not been utilised.

39Moreover, there is no duty imposed on a court or tribunal to ensure that a party uses the opportunity given to its best advantage: Sullivan v Department of Transport (1978) 20 ALR 323 at 343 (per Deane J); Re Association of Architects of Australia; ex parte Municipal Officers' Association of Australia [1989] HCA 13; (1989) 63 ALJR 298 at 305 (per Gaudron J, with whom Dawson J agreed).

40I do not consider that the applicant was denied procedural fairness. The applicant had an adequate opportunity to prepare and to present that which the applicant sought to present in relation to the circumstances of his offending.

41These offences were committed because of the debt that was owed. They were committed because the applicant had a need for money to pay that debt, non-payment of which would endanger, or might endanger, his family. The sentencing judge took that into account in an appropriate manner. Further, as it will be discussed later, even if the sentencing judge's treatment of the circumstances were inappropriate, I do not consider that a lesser sentence is warranted.

Ground 2: The aggregate sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust

42This ground does not suggest, and it is not submitted on behalf of the applicant, that each individual sentence was unreasonable, plainly unjust or manifestly excessive. Rather, the ground of appeal challenges the level of accumulation of the sentences and the totality of the sentence imposed.

43This Court has observed on a number of occasions (R v MMK [2006] NSWCCA 272; (2006) 164 A Crim R 481 at 486; Murray v R [2013] NSWCCA 12) that questions of accumulation and totality are matters primarily within the discretion of the sentencing judge and this Court will be reluctant to intervene. Intervention can occur only on one of the well known bases for interference with a discretionary exercise: House v R [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505.

44None of the offences for which the applicant was sentenced contain overlapping factual elements. That comment does not refer to the theoretical elements but to the factual circumstances of the commission of each offence.

45In other words, each offence was separate and no part of one offence overlapped with the other, except in relation to the offence of impairing electronic communications, which is ordinarily an aspect of the commission of certain types of break, enter and steal. All of the offences of break and enter (either with intent to steal or to steal) were committed on separate occasions and involved separate victims.

46In any event, the sentence for the offence of impairing electronic communications was imposed in a way which rendered it served wholly concurrently with the sentence for break and enter with intent to commit an indictable offence.

47Further to the foregoing, the level of accumulation varied as between the offences. As set out earlier three of the offences (sequences 19, 34 and 36) were wholly concurrent and accumulated by 12 months on the sentence for sequence 31 (break and enter with intent to commit serious indictable offence) and the sentence for interference with electronic communications.

48Sequence 5 accumulated by a period of 2 years on to sequences 19, 34 and 36 and sequences 9, 13 and 1 accumulated for a period of one year each on to the earlier sentences. Generally, with the exception of sequence 1, which took account of the offences for break and enter on the Form 1, only one to two years of any one sentence would be served additionally.

49Moreover, for a total of seven sentences of break, enter and steal, one sentence of break, enter with intent to steal and one sentence for impair electronic communications, which have maximum sentences of 14 years, 10 years and 10 years respectively, a total sentence in aggregate of 13 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 9 years has been imposed. I reiterate that there were 10 further offences taken into account on a Form 1, which, in the sentences to which they were relevant, emphasise the need for deterrence.

50I accept that none of the offences are in the worst category. The applicant is not a person who has no criminal history and, as a consequence of that, he is not entitled to the leniency afforded a first offender. Nor is the applicant a person who has not before spent time in a penal institution.

51Notwithstanding the finding by the sentencing judge, with which I do not cavil, that the applicant has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation, the history of the applicant and the circumstances of the offending show that specific and general deterrence are significant factors. Yet, the sentencing judge imposed a sentence on the applicant for nine offences, taking account of a further 10 on a Form 1, which is less than the maximum sentence for one break, enter and steal.

52In terms of totality of the sentence imposed, the extent of the accumulation and concurrency were not outside of the range available to his Honour in the exercise of the sentencing judge's discretion. For this reason this ground of appeal also fails.

Conclusion

53Lastly, I refer to the function of this Court in dealing with a sentence on appeal. It should be stressed that the determination of a sentence to be imposed on an offender is a process of intuitive synthesis. The exercise of discretion reposed in sentencing judges must be considered in that context. There is no single correct sentence applicable as a matter of mathematical precision.

54Further, judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and application of principle (Johnson v R [2004] HCA 15; (2004) 78 ALJR 616 at [26]; Vuni v R [2006] NSWCCA 171 at [33]). It is not for this Court to substitute its own opinion for that of a sentencing judge, merely because it may have exercised its discretion in a manner different from that of the sentencing judge. Ultimately, the Court, in order to intervene, must find error, either identifiable or manifest, and come to the view that a lesser sentence is warranted.

55I am not of the view that there has been error of the kind for which it would be appropriate to intervene and I am not of the view that a lesser sentence is warranted. For those reasons, I propose that the Court should issue the following orders:

(1)Leave to appeal granted;

(2)Appeal dismissed.

56BELLEW J: I agree with Rothman J.

		04 March 2013",2013-02-28 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2707096,Leslie v R [2013] NSWCCA 48,"Judgment
1McCLELLAN CJ at CL:  The applicant pleaded guilty to 3 counts concerning sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years. The counts were as follows:
Count 1: attempt sexual intercourse with a child under 10 years (penile/vaginal) s 66B Crimes Act 1900: maximum penalty 25 years imprisonment.
Count 2: aggravated sexual intercourse with a child under 10 years (digital/vaginal) s 66A(2) of the Crimes Act 1900: maximum penalty life imprisonment; 15 years standard non-parole period.
Count 3: aggravated sexual assault with a child under 10 years (fellatio) s 66A(2) of the Crimes Act 1900: maximum penalty life imprisonment; 15 years standard non-parole period.
2The offences occurred on the night of 18 February 2010. The applicant was arrested the following day. He was committed for trial and a trial date was set. However, his initial trial was vacated at the request of the applicant. In the weeks leading up to the second trial the applicant indicated an intention to plead guilty and his pleas were entered on 19 August 2011, some 18 months after his arrest.
3When the applicant was sentenced he asked the sentencing judge to have regard to 2 further offences appearing on a Form 1 when sentencing for count 2. The 2 further offences were:
Item 1: aggravated enter premises with intent: s 11(2) Crimes Act 1900: maximum penalty 14 years imprisonment.
Item 2: detain for advantage s 86(1)(b) Crimes Act 1900 maximum penalty 14 years imprisonment.
4At the time of committing the offences the applicant was on bail in relation to an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He had failed to appear on that bail and a warrant had been issued for his arrest.
5The sentencing judge allowed a reduction of 10% for the pleas of guilty. Her Honour was informed that the applicant was already serving a sentence for matters dealt with in the Local Court and had regard to these matters when structuring the sentences for the present offences.
6The applicant was sentenced as follows:
Count 1: a term of 17 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 11 years and 10 months to date from 8 March 2011 (the date of the expiry of the pre-existing sentence) Accordingly the non-parole period is 69% of the total term.
Count 3: a term of 19 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 13 years and 9 months to date from 8 September 2011 (effectively providing for 6 months accumulation on count 1 and a non-parole period of 69% of the total term).
Count 2: (having regard to the matters on the Form 1) a term of imprisonment of 22 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 15 years and 2 months to date from 8 March 2012 (being 6 months accumulation on count 3 with a non parole period of 67% of the total term).
7Accordingly, the overall sentence for the 3 offences is 23 years and 6 months imprisonment with a total non-parole period of 16 years and 2 months, being 68% of the total term.
8When the sentences imposed in the Local Court are considered the overall sentence was imprisonment for a term of 24 years and 7 months with an overall non-parole period of 17 years and 3 months being 70% of the total term.
9There are two grounds of appeal as follows:
Ground 1: Her Honour erroneously held that a standard non-parole period of 15 years applied to count 1.
Ground 2: the sentences were manifestly excessive.
The facts
10An agreed set of facts was tendered to the sentencing judge.
11On Wednesday the 17th of February 2010 the complainant who was 8 years old was at home with her family at Tregear. That evening there were a number of people who stayed the night at the house. The Complainant went to sleep in the lounge room with a friend who was visiting. Her mother was sleeping in the main bedroom with her partner, and other family members were at home.
12At around about midnight the complaint's sister heard a knock on the door. A person she knew by the nick name ""Jai boy"" or Jai Towney (the applicant) was at the door. He asked her if her mum was home. She told the applicant that her mother was in bed. The applicant then asked whether her brother was home. The complainant's sister told the applicant that he was in the next street with some friends. The applicant then left. Some time after midnight, the complaint's brother came home with other friends. They went to sleep in a bedroom or the lounge. It is unclear whether the house was secure at this point in time.
13Some time during the night the complainant woke up to find the applicant sitting in the lounge room. [First count on the Form 1 - enter dwelling with intent to commit a serious indictable offence - Child Abduction]
14The complainant said to the applicant: ""where is my mum."" The applicant told the complainant that she might be at ""Belinda's"" and told her to come with him and take a walk. The complainant says that the applicant dragged her by the shirt from the house. [Second count on the Form 1 - Detain for advantage]
15They went to a nearby house and the applicant approached the door with the complainant. The applicant had hold of her hand at this stage. The applicant then said that Belinda was not there and told the complainant that they would go to the bush and try and find her.
16The applicant then took her to nearby bush land near a roundabout. The applicant then pulled the complainant's pants down and said ""are you wet"" and tried to lick her. The applicant also said: ""If you don't do it I'm going to kill you"".
17According to the complainant during the time that she was with the applicant he:
Rolled her onto her back with her legs apart near her shoulders. He put his penis on her ""rude part vagina"". The complainant said that it started to hurt because ""it didn't fit in there"" and the applicant stopped trying to penetrate her vagina. [Count 1 on the Indictment -Attempted sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10]
The applicant then put his finger in her vagina and moved it around. He had his finger in her vagina for about a minute. She said that it hurt her. He did this according to the complainant because ""his rude part would not fit"". [Count 2 on the Indictment - Aggravated sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10]
The applicant withdrew his finger from the complainant's vagina and pulled her head down until her mouth was on his penis and he ejaculated in her mouth. The complainant said that the she spat out the ""yucky white stuff'. [Count 3 on the Indictment - Aggravated sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10]
18The applicant then took the complainant back home. She says that he told her not to tell her mum. The complainant ran inside and locked the door. She went back to the couch and went to sleep.
19The complainant woke up in the morning and went to the toilet and blood came out of her vagina. She complained to her mother. Her sister told her mother that she had seen the applicant at their house at around midnight.
20The police were called following which the complainant was taken to Westmead Hospital. She complained of pain to her vagina. Dr Griffiths examined her and found her to have a red and swollen hymen, her hymen had an almost complete transection at both 4 o'clock and 10 o'clock, she had a laceration to the posterior fourchette, [bruising to the labia majora], and blood could still be seen in the complainant's urine. Inside her mouth were petechia on her palate. She had a few irregular scratch marks on her buttocks. These are the injuries that the Crown says constitute actual bodily harm in terms of the aggravation.
21In July 2010 Dr Paul Tait a consultant paediatrician considered the findings. He formed the view that the petechiae found on the complainant's palate (in circumstances where she was not ill) was most likely caused by blunt trauma to the palate and would support an allegation of fellatio. The injuries to the complainant's genitalia also supported the allegation made of digital/vaginal penetration.
22On Friday 19 February 2011 at around 5:30pm the police received information that the applicant was at St Marys, at the home of a relative. When the police arrived at the premises the applicant fled out the back door and jumped a fence. A number of police were called to the scene including an officer with a police dog. The applicant was found hiding under a neighbouring house and arrested.
23The applicant participated in a record of interview, which was recorded. He said that he had been drinking since Monday that week and taking drugs. He told the police that he was drinking on Wednesday night (the night of the offence) in Lethbridge Park but he could not remember where he slept. He told the police that he had been drinking in a park on Wednesday morning with some cousins and friends. He did not remember where he slept on Tuesday night and says that on occasion he blanks out. He admitted he had previously lived in the same street as the complainant but he told police that he did not know the complainant or her family. He claimed that prior to his arrest he had been wearing a black singlet and black tracksuit pants. Witnesses had described him in similar clothes. When the allegations of the complainant were put to him he denied any memory of them and said he only remembered drinking with his mates that night.
24The applicant told the police that he remembered going to St Marys on Thursday the 18th to stay with his cousin's girlfriend and her brother. He admitted to having washed his tracksuit pants.
25According to the applicant he was aware that the police were looking for him for this offence but said that he did not do it and could only remember being with his cousins. He said he would have run off because he knew there were other warrants out for his arrest.
26He told the police: ""Well I can't remember much that night so I'm not, not sure if I done it to tell you the truth cause all this stuff's going on and some of the people are making allegations to saying that I know they're saying that I done it and all this sort of stuff. I know this if I done it I can't remember that I've done it but if I've done it then I've done it and I feel sorry for the little girl too"".
27He finally admitted to remembering being in Tregear on Wednesday night. He said that he knocked on the door of his cousin's house. The applicant told the police that the next thing he remembered was being on his cousin's trampoline.
28DNA evidence revealed semen found on the complainant's pants and top. The applicant was identified as having the same DNA profile as was found on these items of clothing. The identified profile is expected to occur in fewer than 1 in 10 billion individuals in the general population.
The remarks of the sentencing judge
29Although it was submitted to the sentencing judge that the applicant's plea was evidence of his contrition and remorse her Honour did not make that finding. She observed that until the DNA evidence was available the applicant had feigned ignorance of the offence. Some time after the offence had been committed his own child died and her Honour accepted that this tragedy may have caused the applicant to reflect on his previous criminal conduct. The applicant's aunt gave evidence before the sentencing judge and said that the applicant believed that his son's death was a form of punishment for his prior offending. However, the sentencing judge was of the opinion that the applicant's self reflection and feelings of guilt were self focused and did not amount to an acknowledgment of the harm and trauma he had caused the complainant or the sheer depravity of his actions.
30Her Honour was also mindful of the fact that the applicant continued to claim that he had no memory of his offending conduct. Although he had indicated to a psychologist that he would apologise to the complainant he had not done so. Having regard also to the fact that the applicant had not given evidence and accordingly the genuineness of his purported contrition could not be tested. The sentencing judge concluded that the plea was not evidence of remorse.
31The sentencing judge gave detailed consideration to the circumstances of the offences. Her Honour observed that the applicant had removed the complainant from her home after he had convinced her he would help her look for her mother. With physical persuasion accompanied by threats to kill the complainant he took her to a secluded place. He then attempted to force his penis into her vagina but because of her young age the attempted act of intercourse could not be completed. He then digitally penetrated her for about a minute with such force that injury was inflicted. He then inserted his penis into her mouth and after a short while ejaculated. He inserted his penis with such force that the roof of the complainant's mouth was bruised. Her Honour said ""he threatened her, her held her forcefully and he used his physical superiority to commit each of the offences. The force was significant, considering the applicant was dealing with an 8 year old child. The use of threats of pressure before and after the offence to ensure the victim's compliance with the demands made, and subsequent silence is a feature of these offences.""
32Her Honour concluded that the offences occurred over a time period of less than an hour. The applicant then took the child home and told her she was not to tell anyone what had happened. The sentencing judge concluded that the complainant was so terrified and stunned she did not tell her mother of the events until the physical consequences of the acts became obvious when she went to the toilet and passed blood.
33The sentencing judge referred to the decision of this Court in R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434; 150 A Crim R 575 in which the possibility of constructing a hierarchy of seriousness of sexual offences was discussed but rejected. In the present case her Honour concluded that the act of digital penetration which occurred only after the applicant could not force his penis into the child did not lessen the seriousness of the offence. Her Honour said of the act of fellatio that ""in circumstances of the use of such force as to bruise the roof of her mouth, and to ejaculate into her mouth is particularly disturbing."" Her Honour also said ""the attempted act of penile penetration is in the circumstances including the threat and pain inflicted a serious act. Each of these physical acts is above a mid point of objective seriousness.""
34Her Honour concluded that there was evidence of some forward planning by the applicant. He attended the home of the complainant on two occasions on the evening of the offences. On the second occasion he had the intention of committing these crimes. Her Honour also concluded that there was evidence of the applicant having made plans to avoid detection.
35Her Honour commented upon the potential of these offences to cause long term harm to the complainant. Her Honour also observed that the physical injuries to the complainant ""represent a serious consequence of the aggravated offences."" Her Honour concluded that the injuries were combined ""with the quite severe psychological trauma."" Her Honour observed that there was strong evidence of the complainant's self esteem being significantly compromised and that she required a ""substantial period of specialised treatment.""
36Her Honour observed that the evidence of the psychologist Anna Robilliard and the applicant's aunt Ms Mathews indicated that he had told them that he could not remember the event. However, her Honour concluded that the applicant had washed his clothes on the following day for which there was no other explanation than that he was attempting to hide evidence. The statements by Ms Robilliard could not be confirmed and her Honour was of the view that there was otherwise no evidence that his actions were in any manner disinhibited by any mental condition or temporary disability. Her Honour concluded that intoxication was not a relevant matter and that there were no issues of mental illness or intellectual disability which were causally related to the commission of the offence.
37Her Honour was of the view that the injuries to the complainant relevantly constituted aggravation for the purposes of the offence (s 66A(3)(a)-(h)). Her Honour said that when considering the objective seriousness of each offence she had otherwise had regard to the applicant's record of previous convictions for serious personal violence offences. Her Honour concluded that the present offences were not an isolated incident of violent behaviour. He has a number of Children's Court entries relating to property crime, including break and enter offences and, as an adult, an offence related to stalk and intimidate. Her Honour identified the fact that the offences were committed while the applicant was on bail in relation to an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
38Her Honour recorded the submission on behalf of the applicant in which mitigating factors were sought to be identified. It was submitted that the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity. However, her Honour did not accept that it was totally spontaneous.
39In relation to the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation her Honour indicated that Ms Robilliard had observed that his risk of re-offending was ""deemed to be high and would only reduce with the reduction and control of his drug and alcohol related behaviour."" Ms Robilliard reported that ""other anti-social behavioural elements required focussed intervention."" Her Honour concluded that having regard to the evidence ""any finding that he is either remorseful, or has insight into the causes of his offending and wishes to address those causes, or that he is motivated to reform his life is unable to be made."" However her Honour found hope in the fact that the applicant was a young person still capable of personal development.
40The applicant is of Aboriginal heritage and at the time he was sentenced was 22 years of age. He was educated to Higher School certificate level, but received his final education while in juvenile detention. He is literate and has skills which enabled him to obtain employment. However, after a period of full-time employment he left his job and was unemployed for about 12 months prior to this incident.
41The applicant has the support of his aunt, who appears to be close to him. Her Honour observed that the applicant has support from his father and that his mother has visited him in custody. Her Honour found that the applicant's physical health is reported to be good and although his mental health is ""under strain"" there was no evidence of any significant mental health issues.
42It was submitted to the sentencing judge that because the applicant was arrested in a blaze of publicity after a manhunt her Honour should find that this amounted to extra curial punishment. Her Honour declined to make this finding.
43The Crown submitted to her Honour that the offences represented the worst case for the offences charged. Counsel for the applicant conceded that they were above mid-range. Her Honour found the offences to be significantly above the mid-range of seriousness but not in the worst category.
44Her Honour concluded that specific deterrence, community protection and denunciation of the applicant's conduct were important when sentencing him. However, her Honour was conscious of the fact that the applicant is a young man and there was a need, consistent with the other considerations to be mindful of a possibility of his rehabilitation.
45Her Honour considered the principles discussed by this Court in R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58. Her Honour identified the fact that the applicant spent his early years in a small community in Walcha. He lived with his father in Walcha and Tamworth. His early childhood was marred by his father's aggressive behaviour and alcohol abuse. The applicant told Ms Robilliard that as a young person he was the victim of sexual abuse and a lack of maternal support and affection.
46The applicant's drug and alcohol abuse started at about 11 years of age. Her Honour observed that his background was dysfunctional and that he appears to have few skills which would assist him both in personal relationships and living a healthy lifestyle. Her Honour found that it was fortunate that he was able to read and write and that except for his substance abuse issues he was able to function both in ""an Aboriginal and European setting."" Her Honour concluded that although the applicant has had some difficulties in life the objective features of these offences are such that his subjective circumstances:
""cannot outweigh the heinous nature of these offences. While he claims to have no memory of these offences I do not make that finding ... He stated to the psychologist that he does not have issues relating to sexual attraction towards children but was unable to be tested on that. This is an offence of a confronting and terrible sexual nature. It is also however an offence of significant violence, and where the offender sought to impose his physical power over a defenceless young child, who he took from a place of safety to perform acts of sexual violence for his personal gratification. While to some extent, [the applicant's] dysfunctional background may explain some of his other criminal antecedents, it does not assist him a great deal as a factor in mitigation with respect to this offence. ...
""However, as in this case, where a court is unable to make positive findings about remorse, prospects of rehabilitation and cannot find with any confidence that there is a small prospect of re-offending, the protection of the community is a strong sentencing consideration.""
The appeal
47The Crown concedes that her Honour was mistaken when she indicated that count 1 carried a standard non-parole period of 15 years. There is no standard non-parole period for this offence. Her Honour imposed a non-parole period of 11 years and 10 months for the offence which carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years.
48In relation to ground 2 it was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the effective sentence was similar to the sentence which would be imposed for an offence of murder. 
49It was submitted that the offences all took place on the one night and involved the same complainant. Although there was evidence of injuries to the complainant it was submitted that they were limited, although it was accepted that the extent of psychological injury could not at this stage be fully appreciated.
50The applicant referred to a number of cases that were said to be comparable to his own circumstances. In AJP the offender was charged with one count of sexual intercourse with a child under 10. There was one offence of aggravated indecent assault included on a Form 1. The applicant was the uncle of the complainant, who was babysitting her. He forced the complainant to perform fellatio upon him, and rubbed his penis against her vagina. There was evidence that the complainant suffered psychological damage.
51AJP was 22 years old at the time of the offence. He had no prior convictions. He was sentenced to 3 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months. On a Crown appeal, this was increased to a sentence of 5 years with a non-parole period of 2½ years.
52In Kite v Regina [2009] NSWCCA 12 the applicant was charged with two counts of sexual intercourse with a child under 10. The applicant had attended a New Year's Eve party held by the complainant's parents. He did not know the complainant before the party. While the complainant was sleeping, the applicant moved her underpants to one side and inserted his tongue into her vagina. He then inserted his finger into her vagina.
53Kite pleaded guilty. He had only a minor criminal record. He was sentenced to a total sentence of 8 years 10 months with a non-parole period of 5 years 6 months. On appeal, this sentence was reduced to an overall sentence of 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years 6 month.
54In Regina v King [2009] NSWCCA 117 the applicant was charged with one count of sexual intercourse with a child under 10. The applicant asked the judge to take into account three matters on a Form 1, namely, an act of indecency, steal from a dwelling house, and attempt to take a motor vehicle. The complainant was a 4 year old girl who was staying at her grandmother's house. The applicant entered the house at night, apparently intending to steal a car. He entered the complainant's bedroom and removed his pants and underpants. He inserted his finger into the complainant's vagina. The applicant then ejaculated while leaning over the complainant. He then broke into a car but was unable to start it.
55King pleaded guilty. He was 23 years old at the time of the offence. He was of Aboriginal heritage. He had a criminal record mainly for matters of dishonesty.
56The sentencing judge imposed a suspended sentence of 2 years. On a Crown appeal to this Court, the applicant was re-sentenced to 7 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months. McClellan CJ at CL (with whom the other judges of this Court agreed) said but for the fact that it was a Crown appeal the appropriate sentence was a period of 9 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years 9 months (at [70]-[71]).
57In AWKO v Regina [2010] NSWCCA 90 the applicant was charged with one count of sexual intercourse with a child under 10. The applicant was the complainant's daughter. When the complainant's mother was absent, the applicant began kissing the complainant. He then instructed her to undress and inserted his penis into her anus. The complainant told police that she was screaming and crying because it hurt. The applicant ejaculated.
58AWKO pleaded guilty. He was 33 years old. He had no prior criminal convictions and was otherwise of good character. He was sentenced to 8 years, 3 months, and 13 days, with a non-parole period of 4 years, 5 months and 15 days. This Court dismissed his appeal. There was no Crown appeal and no suggestion that the sentence was inadequate.
59Senior counsel for the applicant acknowledged that each of these cases involved offences against s 66A(1) of the Act rather than s 66A(2). Section 66A(1) carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. However, it was submitted that the circumstances of aggravation in the present offences involved a limited degree of physical harm.
60Senior counsel submitted that the applicant had been sentenced to a head sentence more than double the most significant head sentence imposed in these cases which was 8 years 3 months and 13 days in the matter of AWKO. It was submitted that the case which most closely resembled the present offences on its facts was that of King where the court, in a Crown appeal, said that the sentence which should have been imposed was 9 years imprisonment with a non parole period of 6 years 9 months. The offender in King was not entitled to be in the premises, was aged in his early 20s, had a criminal record, mainly for dishonesty and pleaded guilty. The head sentence was less than half of the head sentence of any of the individual sentences imposed on the applicant in the present appeal apart from count 1.
61The applicant also referred to the statistics kept by the Judicial Commission in relation to offences under s 66A(2). Between January 2009 and June 2011 there were only 6 cases. The head sentences of the offences ranged between 5 and 14 years. The non-parole periods were all 7 or 8 years in length.
62It was submitted that although her Honour was conscious of the decision in the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39 her Honour may have concluded that because she found the offences to be above the mid point of objective seriousness, she was obliged to impose a non-parole period in excess of the standard non-parole period.
63In response the Crown submitted that it was significant that there was no challenge to the characterisation of the objective seriousness of any of the three offences appearing on the indictment. Defence counsel accepted that the offences fell above the mid range of objective seriousness. Furthermore, the sentencing judge found that each of the items on the Form 1 were serious offences being ""precursor offences to the substantive offences."" Furthermore, when the offences were committed the applicant was on bail for an offence of personal violence.
64The respondent submitted that there was limited assistance available from comparative cases. It was submitted that the only relevant decision of this Court is JRM v R [2012] NSWCCA 112. It was accepted that decisions in relation to offences contrary to s 66A (now s 66A(1)) of the Act provide some assistance although the maximum penalty is only 25 years imprisonment.
65The respondent referred to the decision of this Court in AJP where Simpson J remarked at [37] in relation to the maximum penalty for the offence ""... that is what the legislature has decreed, and it is for this Court to implement the dictates of the legislature."" In the Second Reading Speech when the section was introduced it was said that ""in recognition of the heinousness of committing such an aggravating offence against a child under the age of 10 the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life.""
66The respondent accepted that the sentences which her Honour imposed were substantial. However, it was submitted that when both the maximum penalties and the standard non-parole periods are considered the sentences were just. 
67The respondent also identified a number of decisions which it was submitted may be of assistance although that assistance may be limited.
68The decision of JRM concerns sentences imposed pursuant to s 66A(2) of the Act. No violence or threats of violence were involved although there was a breach of trust. The fellatio offences were committed upon the offender's 9 year old son. The offender was of good character and received a 25% discount for early pleas. The sentences on appeal were reduced to a total term of 7 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years; and a term of 5 years and 4 months with a non-parole period of 4 years.
69In RJA v R [2008] NSWCCA 137 the offender was sentenced after trial for 3 offences contrary to s 66A [maximum 25 years imprisonment] [2 penile penetration with penetration of the labia only and one digital penetration] committed upon his daughter when she was aged 8 and 9. The offender was of previous good character and was found to be unlikely to reoffend. The sentences imposed on appeal were a term of 16 years with a non-parole period of 12 years; a term of 8 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years and a term of 14 years with a non-parole period of 10 years. The offences covered by the first and third sentences were found to be within the middle level of seriousness. This resulted in an overall sentence of 17 years with a non-parole period of 13 years.
70MLP v R [2006] NSWCCA 271 concerned a sentence after trial for one offence pursuant to s 66A [maximum 25 years imprisonment] of a father offending in an isolated act against his 9 year old daughter. The sexual act was penile penetration resulting in the hymen being torn. The offence clearly involved a breach of trust. There was no finding of remorse. He was not a person of good character. The Court was satisfied the offence fell within the mid range. The sentence on appeal was varied to 16 years with a non-parole period of 11 years.
71The Court in Ingham v R [2011] NSWCCA 88 considered the sentences imposed upon an offender who was convicted after trial of sexually assaulting [s 66A maximum 25 years imprisonment] a 9 year old girl and an 8 year old girl numerous times over the same night in the presence of each other. The offences included penile penetration, digital penetration and cunnilingus. The judge assessed the objective seriousness of the offences finding only the penile penetrations to be above the mid-range. There were in addition some indecent assaults. There was evidence that there had been some sexual assault the previous weekend and the offences were not dealt with as isolated. There was some evidence of planning as condoms were brought. There was a breach of trust as the applicant was a family friend entrusted to babysit. The applicant had an early conviction for sexual assault upon a child. There was no remorse. The Court intervened to adjust sentences influenced by the wrong standard non-parole period. The sentences for the sexual intercourse offences were:
Digital x 3  13 years 4 months with 10 years NPP;Cunnilingus x 2 20 years with 15 years NPP;Penile x 2  21 years 4 months with 16 years NPP;Attempt fellatio 12 years with 9 years NPP;Fellatio  20 years with 15 years NPP.
72In a sentence imposed after trial for one offence of digital penetration [s 66A maximum penalty 25 years imprisonment] upon a 5 year old, with objective seriousness moderately below mid range, minor criminal history but no prior sexual offences, and reasonable prospects of rehabilitation this Court by majority, approved a sentence of 12 years with a non-parole period of 9 years: RR v R [2011] NSWCCA 235.
73In AWKO v R [2010] NSWCCA 90 the Court considered the sentence imposed after a plea of guilty for an isolated and spontaneous offence of penile/anal sexual intercourse [s 66A maximum penalty 25 years imprisonment] upon the offender's 6 year old daughter. There was a gross breach of trust. The offence was found to be mid-range. The offender was remorseful, had no criminal history and was found to have good prospects of rehabilitation. The Court did not disturb the sentence of 12 years 8 months and 28 days with a non-parole period of 4 years 5 months and 15 days.
74A sentence of 8 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 6 years and 2 months was imposed on appeal for one opportunistic offence of fellatio with a 9 year old [s 66A maximum penalty 25 years imprisonment]: Eedens v R [2009] NSWCCA 254. Two other sexual assaults committed on the same afternoon upon a 13 year old and an 8 year old were placed on a Form 1. The offender was aged 71 with prior sexual offences. He was a neighbour and therefore there was some breach of trust. A finding had been made of reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. A 25% reduction was granted for a plea of guilty. The Court found the offence to be significantly below the mid range of objective seriousness.
75Kite v R [2009] NSWCCA 12 concerned sentences imposed after pleas of guilty to an offence of cunnilingus and an offence of digital penetration upon a 6 year old [s 66A maximum penalty 25 years imprisonment] committed on the same occasion. A reduction of 25% flowed from the pleas. The Court accepted that the offender was remorseful and had good prospects of rehabilitation. He had only a limited criminal history. Sentences, partially accumulated, of 7½ years with a non-parole period of 4½ years were imposed.
76In the Crown appeal of R v King [2009] NSWCCA 117 the Court indicated that the appropriate sentence for an offence only slightly below mid range in seriousness after a reduction of 25% for a plea should have been one of 9 years with a non-parole period of 6 years and 9 months [there were 3 offences on a Form 1]. The offender digitally penetrated [s 66A maximum penalty 25 years imprisonment] a 4 year old girl after breaking into her house. The offender was 23 and subject to suspended sentences at the time of offending.
77It is apparent that all but one of the cases to which the parties directed attention (JRM) concerned offences contrary to s 66A of the Act for which the maximum penalty was confined to imprisonment for 25 years. Very few deal with findings as to the seriousness of the offending at the same high level found by the judge.
78JRM is unlikely to be typical of offences contrary to s 66A(2) and I do not consider it to be of assistance in the present case.
79Section 66A(2) which provides the aggravated form of the offence for which the maximum penalty is life imprisonment represents a significant increase in the maximum penalty from that provided for the lesser offence which is a clear indication of the serious view taken by the Parliament of offences of this character. A sentencing court must be mindful of the serious view which the Parliament has taken of the aggravated offence.
80This case raises a number of difficult and complex issues. Although, as the sentencing judge concluded, the offences do not fall within the worst category of offence they were significantly above the mid-range of objective seriousness. So much was recognised by defence counsel. The applicant has not challenged her Honour's finding in that respect. The removal of the child from the safety of the home and subjecting her to forceful physical and sexual acts reflects criminality of a high order and having regard to the penalty provided by the Parliament requires a significant term of imprisonment.
81Any sentence must also recognise that the applicant has not demonstrated remorse or contrition and has uncertain prospects of rehabilitation. He has a significant record, including for offences of violence. The present offences were committed while he was on bail. Her Honour correctly recognised that the sentence must reflect the need to protect the community. That finding was also not challenged by the applicant.
82The sentencing of the applicant is made more difficult by his relative youth. He was 20 years of age at the time of the offences. He has had a troubled upbringing with a dysfunctional family life. He took to abusing alcohol and prohibited substances at an early age. It is plain that he has lacked an appreciation of how to conduct himself within society. 
83In this case the potential of the total sentence which her Honour imposed to crush the applicant's expectations of a normal life and destroy any prospect of rehabilitation is troubling. Of course, whether the sentence would result in the applicant completely abandoning any prospects of rehabilitating himself and returning to society as a responsible citizen cannot be known with certainty. However, there is every likelihood that a young person of 22 years of age facing incarceration for at least 17 years will despair and give up hope. If at all possible this prospect should be avoided.
84The sentencing judge acknowledged that at the date he was sentenced the applicant was still a young man. Her Honour identified that there may still be opportunities for him to rehabilitate himself which may be assisted by programs in custody and the opportunity to address his substance abuse. Her Honour concluded that the consequence of the accumulation of sentences provided a special circumstance which justified varying the standard ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence but did not otherwise find special circumstances. However, she indicated that before he was released to parole the applicant would be assessed to determine his level of engagement with the services and therapy available in custody which might assist him in re-establishing himself upon his release.
85But for the applicant's youth, having regard to the seriousness of these offences and recognising that counts 2 and 3 carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 15 years I would not have concluded that the sentences were excessive. However, the importance of ensuring that so far as was possible the sentences which were imposed were not crushing and provided an opportunity for the applicant to rehabilitate himself persuades me that this Court ought to intervene. Although the applicant must serve a lengthy period of fulltime custody it should be reduced. A finding of special circumstances which her Honour made and which was appropriate will ensure that at the appropriate time the applicant's prospects can be assessed and if appropriate he could be released and supervised for a lengthy period in the community.
86In relation to count one, where her Honour was under the belief that there was a standard non-parole period, I am satisfied that the sentence which her Honour imposed was influenced by that error and for that reason is excessive. A lesser sentence should be imposed although a reduction in that sentence will have little overall impact on the period of imprisonment.
87The orders which in my judgment are appropriate are:
1. Leave to appeal granted, the appeal upheld and the sentences imposed in the District Court are quashed.
2. Sentence the applicant as follows:
(a) In respect of count 1 to a fixed term of 10 years imprisonment to date from 8 March 2011.
(b) In respect of count 3 to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 10 years to date from 8 March 2012 with a balance of term of 5 years.
(c) In respect of count 2, and having regard to the maters on the Form 1, to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 11 years to date from 8 March 2013 with a balance of term of 6 years expiring on 7 March 2030.
Accordingly the earliest date upon which the applicant may be released to parole is 8 March 2024. The total sentence is an overall term of 19 years with a non-parole period of 13 years.

		03 March 2013",2013-02-28 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2707099,R v Hall [2013] NSWCCA 47,"Judgment
1McCLELLAN CJ at CL:  This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to s 92(4) of the Confiscation of Proceeds of Crime Act 1989 (""the Act"") against the refusal of an application under s 13(2)(b) of the Act for a Drug Proceeds Order. 
Proceedings in the District Court
2The respondent was arrested on 22 July 2010 in relation to his involvement in drug supply. He pleaded guilty in the Local Court to supplying the prohibited drug cannabis (s 25(1) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985) and to knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime (s 193B(2) Crimes Act 1900). The first count pleaded that he supplied cannabis between 1 July 2009 and 23 July 2010. The second count pleaded that during the same period he knowingly dealt with the proceeds of crime, a sum of cash, knowing that it was the proceeds of crime. The amount was not particularised. The matter originally came before one judge of the District Court when the indictment was presented and relevant material was tendered. The application for a Drug Proceeds Order was not pursued at that time as the court was informed that there were discussions afoot that may have resolved the matter.
3On 17 June 2011 the respondent was sentenced to terms of imprisonment in relation to each offence. After the remarks on sentence had been delivered the solicitor appearing for the Director of Public Prosecutions made application for an order for forfeiture of cash ($4,100 and $25,000) under s 13(2)(a) of the Act. This was subsequently amended to a claim for $4,110. The solicitor also sought a Drug Proceeds Order in respect of benefits derived by the respondent from the commission of the drug trafficking offences of $59,765 (s 13(2)(b) of the Act).
4The matter was not resolved at the time of sentence. However, the sentencing judge expressed concern as to the evidence that the Director had tendered in support of the application, saying at one point:
""It is so imprecise, I just don't know how the court is expected to make an order under those circumstances.""
5The Director's application then came before a different judge to the judge who had originally imposed the sentence for determination on 21 October 2011. On 28 October 2011 that judge made an order, not opposed by the respondent, that the respondent forfeit the sum of $4,110 pursuant to s 18(1) of the Act. On the same occasion his Honour declined to order the forfeiture of a further $25,000, his Honour not being satisfied that it was ""tainted property."" His Honour also declined to make an order pursuant to s 29(1) of the Act that the respondent pay the sum of $54,750 pursuant to a Drug Proceeds Order.
6His Honour provided a precise account of his reasoning process. He said that with respect to the order sought pursuant to s 18(1) (the forfeiture of $4,110) ""I have no difficulty in coming to a conclusion that that was tainted property and accordingly I order that that amount be forfeited.""
7However, having considered the evidence relevant to the issue his Honour said that he ""was unable to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that [the sum of $25,000] was used in or in connection with the commission of the offence or was received as a result of the commission of the offence."" For this reason his Honour declined to make an order in respect of the sum of $25,000. The Director does not challenge that decision.
8With respect to the order sought pursuant to s 29(1) of the Act (which sought the sum of $54,750) his Honour said that s 29(1) has ""applicability to drug trafficking quite apart from any drug trafficking which constituted the commission of the offence for which he had been previously sentenced."" His Honour said that the section:
""really provides the court with the power, where any person has been convicted of an offence involving drug trafficking, to consider whether he has at any time in the past obtained a benefit in connection with drug trafficking, although not in connection with the offence for which he was dealt with by the court.""
9His Honour referred to s 30 of the Act, noting that it provides for the court to have regard to ""information"" concerning:
(a) the money or the value of the property other than money that came into the possession or control of the defendant or another person at the request or by the direction of the defendant at any time in connection with drug trafficking by the defendant: s 30(a);
(b) the market value at the time of the drug trafficking of substances similar or substantially similar to the prohibited drug or prohibited plant involving the drug trafficking offence or offences: s 30(d);
(c) the amount that was or the range of amounts that were, ordinarily paid for the doing of an act or things similar or substantially similar to the doing of the act or thing constituting the drug trafficking: s 30(e).
10His Honour then referred to the evidence from an investigating police officer who said that the respondent had volunteered to the police that he had been involved in the supply of drugs at times before the commission of the offence for which he was ultimately charged. His Honour records this evidence in the following manner:
""The police officers explored or attempted to explore the scope of his supply on earlier occasions. He indicated at answer 93 that he thought he had sold cannabis for 'nearly 12 months'. He was asked how much would you say you sell on a daily basis. He said 'I don't know maybe half an ounce'. How much would that be money wise? Answer $150,200. Question: A day? Answer"" No audible reply.
There was further responses which indicated that when he supplied people with cannabis he would weigh it up in front of them. It would be about $20 a gram. He was asked at 103: 'And you sell any more bigger sizes than that? Answer: No, maybe 3 grams for $50.' He was asked 'Are you willing to tell us where you get your drugs from?' He said 'No' adding, 'my life wouldn't be worth living would it.'
At question 109 this appears:
'You just said you sold 1.5 for $20 and 3 grams for $50, but 3 grams is exactly twice of 1.5 grams?' Answer: 'Well mate I don't make the prices, that's just what it is.'
Question 110: That's just the rate that people will pay for? All right. You just told Constable Payne when he asked you when you sold from that people who came to your door? Answer: Sometimes yeah.'
At question 118:
'Have you ever banked any of the cash that you sold from - you've gained from selling marijuana? Answer 'No, since I've never actually made a profit. I only just sell enough to get what I smoke. See I've been a drug addict all my life and I've been on heroin for 25 years. I've just got off the heroin. I've been using the marijuana only I can't afford to buy it, so I've got no choice by to sell it. Question: How much marijuana do you use a day? Well actually I'm cutting down at the moment, so I try to smoke it as least as possible, maybe three times a day.'
He was asked to put a weight value on it, as to how much he smoked a day and he said 'say $50 a day'.
'Question 121: You probably smoke $50 a day? Answer: $100 a day.' Question 122: $50-100, but you were selling somewhere between 150-200 a day? Answer: Sometimes. Question 123: So you're getting a bit on top? Answer: Sometimes I sell $20 a day'.
There are further questions and answers along that same topic. Ultimately the prosecution have requested a Drug Proceeds Order in the sum of $54,750. This was apparently based on some form of calculation derived from those utterances by Mr Hall in his recorded interview.""
11His Honour then expressed his conclusion that because he could not make any meaningful assessment from the available material he declined to make an order. His Honour said:
""In my view, for a court to make an assessment and for it to be a meaningful assessment there would need to be more precise information placed before the court about the actual money that was obtained and in respect of what quantities of drugs were actually supplied. Accordingly, on my reading of that material in the recorded interview I am of the view that it is just not capable of being the basis for any reasonable assessment in accordance with s 29 and 30 of the Confiscating and Proceeds of Crime Act and I decline to make any such order.
 Submissions in this Court
12His Honour's conclusion was challenged by the Director in this Court. It was submitted that in his ERISP the respondent admitted that he had sold cannabis and had been selling ""maybe"" half an ounce a day which, having regard to the prices, may amount to $100 to $200 per day. Although he said that he did not keep records of his sales, he also said that he had been trying to cut down the amount he smoked. He said that he was financing his current habit from his sales.
13The amount originally claimed of $59,765 was calculated by the Director at $175 per day for 365 days being $63,875. From this sum was deducted $4,110 being the forfeited proceeds as required by s 29(2). During argument before his Honour the solicitor for the Director reduced the amount sought to $54,750 being $150 per day for 365 days. In making the calculations the concession was always made that, orders having been for the recovery of $4,110, this sum had to be deducted. It was submitted that because his Honour had declined to make a confiscation order in the sum of $25,000, no further deduction was required.
14The Director also submitted that s 30(6) of the Act provides that expenses or outgoings (being the purchase price of the drugs) are not to be deducted when assessing the benefit: see Director of Public Prosecutions v Nieves [1992] 1 VR 257. It was submitted that once an application had been made for the assessment of a Drug Proceeds Order the court was required to make an order. It was submitted that this could be contrasted with the Pecuniary Penalty provisions which are ""arguably"" discretionary. Section 24(1) of the Act provides that the court ""may make the order sought."" In contrast s 29(1) provides that if an application is made the court ""must"" proceed in accordance with the subsequent provisions of that section.
15It was submitted that although the primary judge may have believed that the application, if granted, would be unduly harsh on the respondent and, having regard to the respondent's personal circumstances, there was little chance of recovery, these matters were irrelevant to the decision that his Honour was required to make.
16The Director submitted that the relevant provisions of the Act operated so that his Honour was first required to determine whether the respondent had made a benefit (s 29(1)(a)) before moving to assess its value (s 29(1)(b)) and thereafter order that it be paid (s 29(1)(c)). It was submitted that his Honour did not engage with the question that he was required to determine pursuant to s 29(1)(a). It was submitted that if his Honour had considered that subsection he would inevitably have found that the respondent had derived a benefit in connection with drug trafficking. This followed from the fact that his Honour had already ordered forfeiture under s 13(2)(a) of the Act of $4,110 in cash, which his Honour had no difficulty in concluding was tainted property. Section 29(2) required this sum to be deducted from the value of any amount assessed under s 29(1). It follows that at least that sum was required to be assessed. 
17With respect to the assessment process it was submitted that the reliability of the admissions in the ERISP had never been challenged by the respondent and provided ample detail to enable his Honour to determine a figure in accordance with s 29(1)(b). It was submitted that the comments by the Court in R v Fagher (1989) 16 NSWLR 67 reflect the reality, which was apparent in this case. When assessing the benefits derived from the illegal activity of drug taking there will normally be no records or at best very inadequate records unlike the evidence that may be available when the court is performing a conventional judicial task. It was submitted that provided there was at least some relevant information the court could never determine that it was ""too hard"" to make an assessment. That task was mandatory. It was further submitted that having regard to the information before the court in the present case it was not beyond his Honour's capacity to have made an assessment.
18It was further submitted in the appellant's written submissions that his Honour proceeded to judgment in the matter before the Director had formally closed its case and before there had been any address from either the Director or the respondent. It was submitted that after receiving the relevant material his Honour did not receive submissions that would have assisted him to a conclusion. However, no ground of appeal that relies upon a denial of procedural fairness was pursued. The appeal was confined to an argument that his Honour had erred in the construction and application of ss 29(1) and 30 of the Act.
Resolution of the appeal
19Two issues require resolution. Firstly, whether s 29 obliges the court to make a Drug Proceeds Order. Secondly, whether in the present case the court had sufficient information to enable an assessment to be made of the benefit that the respondent derived in connection with drug trafficking.
20The respondent submitted that s 29 should be understood as giving a discretion to a court as to whether or not to make an order. Reliance was placed upon a decision in relation to similar legislation in South Australia: Director of Public Prosecutions v George [2008] SASC 300; (2008) 102 SASR 246. Section 95 of the Criminal Assets Confiscation Act 2005 (SA) (""CAC Act"") provides (in subs 1) that upon application by the Director Public Prosecutions, if certain conditions existed the Court ""must"" make a pecuniary penalty order. The Full Court of the South Australian Supreme Court held that having regard to its content the word ""must"" did not impose an obligation but vested a discretion in the Court to make an order.
21Section 95 relevantly provides:
""(1) A court must, on application by the DPP, make an order (a pecuniary penalty order) requiring a specified person to pay an amount determined under Subdivision 2 to the Crown if satisfied that the person has been convicted of, or has committed, a serious offence and -
(a) the person has derived benefits from the commission of the offence; or(b) an instrument of the offence is owned by the person or is under his or her effective control.
(2) The court's power to make a pecuniary penalty order in relation to benefits derived from the commission of a serious offence is not affected by the existence of another confiscation order in relation to the offence (emphasis added).
(3) The court cannot make a pecuniary penalty order in relation to an instrument of a serious offence if-
(a) a pecuniary penalty has been imposed in respect of the instrument under this Act or any other law; or
(b) the instrument has been forfeited, or an application has been made for a forfeiture order that would cover the instrument, under this Act or any other law in relation to the offence (emphasis added).""
22The provisions of the CAC Act are complex. They are summarized in George by Doyle CJ at [17]-[40] and White J at [197]-[201]. The CAC Act provides for restraining orders, freezing orders, forfeiture orders and pecuniary penalty orders. There are two kinds of forfeiture orders: court ordered forfeiture orders under s 47 and statutory forfeiture orders under s 74. Statutory forfeiture means forfeiture that will occur by operation of the provisions of the CAC Act unless a court orders that particular property be excluded: s 76. Two kinds of property may be forfeited: benefits derived from the commission of the offence (proceeds) and instruments of offences (property used in, or in connection with, the commission of an offence).
23In relation to instruments of offences, the court has a discretion whether to make a forfeiture order: s 47(3) of the CAC Act. In deciding whether it is appropriate to make this order the court may have regard to the hardship to any person (other than the suspect) and the ordinary use of the property. In this respect this provision is similar to s 18 of the NSW Act dealing with forfeiture orders, although hardship may be also considered in relation to the defendant under the NSW provision.
24In George a number of questions arose for consideration, one of which was whether a court must make a pecuniary penalty order under s 95 of the CAC Act in relation to an instrument of an offence even though the court had decided under s 47 that it was not appropriate to make a forfeiture order, or had decided under s 76 that the instrument should be excluded from statutory forfeiture, or had decided to exclude the instrument from a restraining order. This involved a consideration of whether ""must"" for the purpose of s 95(1) was to be interpreted as meaning ""may"" so as to confer on the Court a discretionary power not to make a pecuniary penalty order.
25White J, with whom Doyle CJ (at [80]) and Vanstone JJ (at [170]) agreed on this point, held that s 95 was not obligatory in nature and should be construed, in the statutory context, as vesting in the court a discretionary power to make a penalty order (at [239] and [245]).
26White J referred (at [187]) to Re Davis (1947) 75 CLR 409 where the High Court considered s 10 of the Legal Practitioners Act 1898-1936, which provided that every candidate approved by the admissions board ""shall"" be admitted as a barrister by the court. The majority of the High Court held that this provision did not create an obligation, and referred to the context of the Legal Practitioners Act and to the consequences of adopting such a literal construction of s 10. Starke J held at 418:
""But the word ""shall"" does not always impose an absolute and imperative duty to do or omit the act prescribed. The word is facultative: it confers a faculty or power ... Apart from the word ""shall"" there is nothing in the Legal Practitioners Act which suggests an imperative and absolute duty upon the Court to exercise its authority to admit persons as barristers. Indeed the interposition of the Court would be merely ministerial if it were under an absolute duty to admit a person as a barrister upon approval of the Board.  And the Court would be without jurisdiction to refuse admission to any person approved by the Board though information was before it that such person, though unknown to the Board, was a lunatic or a thief or otherwise disreputable or unfit to belong to the profession of a barrister.""
27In George at [191] White J said:
""The question of whether the word ""must"" in s 95 means ""may"" also involves the application of more general principles of statutory interpretation. The modern approach to statutory interpretation of a legislative provision requires the whole context of the legislation in question and its purpose to be considered. The provision should be construed so that it is consistent with the language and purpose of all the provisions in the statute. When this is done, it may indicate the words used in a statutory provision do not have the meaning which they appear, at first sight, to convey.""
28At [192] his Honour said:
""The modern approach to statutory interpretation was stated by Brennan CJ, Dawson, Toohey and Gummow JJ in CIC Insurance Ltd v Bankstown Football Club Ltd in the following terms:
'It is well settled that at common law, apart from any reliance upon s 15AB of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth), the court may have regard to reports of law reform bodies to ascertain the mischief which a statute is intended to cure. Moreover, the modern approach to statutory interpretation (a) insists that the context be considered in the first instance, not merely at some later stage when ambiguity might be thought to arise, and (b) uses ""context"" in its widest sense to include such things as the existing state of the law and the mischief which, by legitimate means such as those just mentioned, one may discern the statute was intended to remedy. Instances of general words in a statute being so constrained by their context are numerous. In particular, as McHugh JA pointed out in Isherwood v Butler Pollnow Pty Ltd (1986) 6 NSWLR 363 at 388, if the apparently plain words of a provision are read in the light of the mischief which the statute was designed to overcome and of the objects of the legislation, they may wear a very different appearance. Further, inconvenience or improbability of result may assist the court in preferring to the literal meaning an alternative construction which, by the steps identified above, is reasonably open and more closely conforms to the legislative intent (emphasis added footnotes omitted)'.""
29The factors White J considered in finding that, in the context of s 95, ""must"" meant ""may"" were:
Section 95(2) refers to the court's ""power"" to make a pecuniary penalty order under s 95(1). This indicated an understanding by Parliament that s 95(1) invests a power in the courts, rather than imposes an obligation: [217].
The role of pecuniary penalty orders within the statutory framework. Pecuniary penalty orders are subordinate to forfeiture orders in respect of the timing of their making and their availability. The fact that there was a prohibition in s 95(3)(b) on making a pecuniary penalty order where an instrument was forfeited or an application for forfeiture was pending indicated the primacy of forfeiture orders over pecuniary penalty orders. A pecuniary penalty order could only be made as an alternative to forfeiture of the same instrument as, if an instrument was forfeited, no application could be made for a pecuniary penalty order s 195(3). However, it did not follow that the Court's powers with respect to pecuniary penalty orders were subordinate: [222]-[229].
The Act contained a detailed regime for court ordered forfeiture, and applications for forfeiture under ss 47 and 76 may involve a substantial hearing. If the court determined under s 47(3) that a forfeiture order is inappropriate, it would be curious if this could be negated by the imposition of the alternative but subordinate sanction of a pecuniary penalty order. Accordingly, if a court was obliged by s 95(1) to make a pecuniary penalty order once satisfied of the specified matters, it would mean that the pecuniary penalty order would operate as the equivalent of a ""trump card."" Thus even where a person is successful in avoiding forfeiture orders under the other substantive provisions of the Act, the effect of that success could be ""trumped"" by a pecuniary penalty order application.
This construction could not have been intended by Parliament, as it would render the substantive hearing provisions in respect of the forfeiture orders pointless: [230]-[234].
The obligatory construction had the potential to bring the administration of justice into disrepute, due to the lack of respect that would be accorded to the now-pointless proceedings in respect of the forfeiture provisions: [236].
30Vanstone J said (at [170]) that the interpretation that s 95 confers a discretionary power was not only available, but also led to a result that ""does no violence to the scheme of the Act.""
31This Court is bound to follow a decision of the Full Court of another State Supreme Court unless persuaded that the decision is wrong: Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 22; (2007) 230 CLR 89. We were urged to take that course by the respondent and determine that s 29 did not oblige the Court to make an order.
32As it happens, it is not strictly necessary to determine the question in this appeal. The trial judge did not decide that he was not obliged to make an order. Instead, his Honour concluded that the information that the court had was insufficient to enable an order to be made. As I will discuss below this must always be a possibility, the most obvious case (although I accept it is unlikely) being where there was no relevant information available to the judge at all.
33There are significant differences between the structure and words used in the CAC Act and the Act. The CAC Act is worded so that the making of an order is facilitated. The Act had been drafted to provide that if an application is made the court must undertake three tasks: (a) determine whether the defendant has derived any benefit; (b) assess its value; and (c) make an order. It is not possible to conclude that the court is not obliged to exercise the power in subsections (1)(a) and (b) in which case it must be obliged, if subsections (a) and (b) are satisfied, to make an order pursuant to subsection (1)(c).
34This position is confirmed by consideration of the legislation which preceded the Act. The Crimes (Confiscation of Profits) Act 1985 provided for a court to make a pecuniary penalty order. Section 10 stated that upon an application being made the court ""may"" order a person to pay a pecuniary penalty: s 19(1)(b). However, the language of obligation was deliberately adopted when the Act was being enacted. The Second Reading speech by the Attorney speaks in terms of a mandatory obligation without any suggestion that in the event that the precondition was fulfilled the making of an order is discretionary.
35The position under the Act is made plain by the contrast between the power in s 18 and s 24 and the power in s 29. Both s 18 and s 24 provide that in appropriate circumstances the court may make an order, clearly providing a discretion. By contrast s 29 provides that a court must undertake the task in subsections 29(1) (a), (b) and (c). The words of obligation in the preamble can only be understood as obliging an order to be made in accordance with s 29(1)(c) provided that the assessment contemplated by s 29(1)(b) has been made.
36The second issue is whether his Honour was, having regard to the information before the Court, correct to decline to make an order. Section 29(1)(a) requires the court to determine whether a defendant has derived any benefit in connection with drug trafficking at any time. If the court believes that a defendant has so benefited it must assess the value of that benefit (s 29(1)(b)) and order the defendant to pay a pecuniary penalty equal to the amount so assessed: s 29(1)(c). The assessment is to be made having regard to the information before the Court as to the matters identified in s 30(1) including:
that the money came into the respondent's possession in connection with drug trafficking: s 30(1)(a); the value of any benefit provided for the respondent: s 30(1)(c); the market value of the drugs (s 30(1)(d)) disregarding any expenses as outgoings incurred by the respondent in connection with the commission of the offences: s 30(6).
37This Court recognised in Fagher that the task of a court in carrying out the assessment required by the Act may prove difficult. Fagher was concerned with the Crimes (Confiscation of Profits) Act, which relevantly adopted the same formulation as in the Act, the court being required to make an assessment ""having regard to information before the court.""
38We were urged by the respondent to adopt a stringent standard of proof when a court is carrying out the assessment task. As I understand the submission, it was that the correct approach required the Director to prove the case on the balance of probabilities ""informed by the decision in Briginshaw v Briginshaw [(1938) 60 CLR 336]."" However, as I understand that submission it is at odds with the words of the statute and the discussion of the task by this Court in Fagher. In Fagher Roden J said at 71-72:
""Calculation or assessment of the value of the benefits derived by a particular offender from any criminal transaction, is likely to be difficult. There will be no audited accounts available, nor can one expect a contract or other documentation evidencing the nature of the dealings among the several participants who may be involved. Additionally, if the participants themselves give evidence of the details of those transactions, their evidence is unlikely to be the most reliable, and to the extent that it may be relied upon is unlikely to disclose clearly defined legal relationships.""
39Allen J then said at 80:
""In the construction of s 10 and s 11 the court should not lose sight of reality that the court, to fulfil its statutory obligation, often will have to assess the value of the benefits derived by the defendant on material which is far less satisfactory than what it normally would expect to have in litigation. It is not the nature of criminals to keep records of such a kind as to assist the court; nor is it the nature of criminals to tell the truth when telling a lie would seem more advantageous. The sections clearly recognise the difficulty of the task imposed upon the court and accept that the assessment of the value must in many cases be a somewhat rough and ready process. Section 11(2) does not speak of the facts proven or even of the 'evidence' adduced. It speaks of the 'information before the Court'. That the legislature envisaged such a roughness and readiness in assessment of the value is clear also from subs (3) and subs(4) of s 11 which provide an arbitrary method of assessment of the minimum value of the 'benefits derived' by comparing the value of the defendant's total assets before the commission of the offence with the value of them after the offence.""
40The primary judge found, and indeed there was no dispute, that the cash sum of $4,110 should be forfeited pursuant to s 18(1), it being tainted property. Although his Honour did not articulate his reason it must be that his Honour concluded that the monies were realised in connection with, and as the result of, the commission of the relevant offence. The consequences of that finding must be that the only conclusion open to his Honour pursuant to s 29(1)(a) was that the respondent had derived a benefit in connection with drug trafficking, at least in the sum of $4,110.
41In the present case the information before the court did not otherwise enable the precise amount of the benefit to the respondent from his drug trafficking to be assessed. However, the admissions made by the respondent, which I have previously related, clearly provided information from which an assessment could be made. His Honour should have made that assessment.
42At first I was minded to order that the matter be remitted to the District Court for the appropriate assessment to be made. However having regard to the additional cost and inconvenience that would be involved I believe it appropriate that this Court exercise the power provided in s 92(4) of the Act and make the appropriate order.
43From the available information it is apparent, and I would on the balance of probabilities conclude, that the respondent was trafficking to at least the extent of $70 per day for nearly twelve months (being the $50 of cannabis he smoked plus an additional sale of at least $20). Accepting that period to be eleven months, I would assess the benefit at 330 days at $70 per day being $23,100. From that sum $4,110 would have to be deducted making $18,990. An order reflecting this assessment should be made.
44Before leaving the matter I should mention that the procedure provided by s 31 for the tender of statements by the prosecution from which an assessment of the benefit to an offender can be made would appear to be the preferable manner by which to prosecute this type of matter. By casting an onus upon the offender to respond, the court may be more comfortably able to make an assessment which must, of course, always be adverse to the interests of an offender. The procedure provided by s 31 appears to be that encouraged by Roden J in Fagher. Section 31A will also be of assistance to the prosecution in many cases.

1. Appeal upheld.2. Order pursuant to s 29(1)(c) of the Confiscation of Proceeds of Crime Act 1989 that the respondent pay to the State of New South Wales the sum of $18,990.

		01 March 2013",2013-02-28 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2707100,Holcroft v R [2013] NSWCCA 45,"Judgment

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant was tried with a co-accused, Kodie Rozilannie Beaudean for the murder of Danny Ralph. The indictment alleged that the relevant events happened in Queanbeyan in the early hours of the morning of 29 March 2008. The indictment pleaded that the co-accused was an accessory after the fact of murder.

2The jury found the applicant guilty of murder but acquitted the co-accused.

3The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 22 years comprising a non-parole period of 17 years and a balance of term of 5 years. 

4There is one ground of appeal which is concerned with the summing-up of the trial judge. It is expressed in the following terms:

The response of his Honour in the summing up to the final address of defence counsel resulted in an unfair trial, thereby occasioning a miscarriage of justice.

Evidence at the Trial

5Before turning to consider the summing-up it is important to understand the essential elements of the Crown case.

6In the early hours of 29 March 2008 the deceased, Danny Ralph, was brutally assaulted on a pedestrian bridge commonly referred to as the ""sway bridge"" which crosses a river in Queanbeyan. The deceased's blood was found at three locations on the bridge. The severely injured body of the deceased was found in the waters of the river below the bridge. Although he initially expressed doubts about the matter the forensic pathologist Dr Duflou expressed the opinion in his evidence at the trial that the cause of death was probably drowning. Certainly, although the assault had occasioned severe injuries to the deceased, drowning could not be excluded as the cause of death. Accordingly, the prosecution accepted that unless it could prove that the applicant had caused the deceased to fall into the water the offence of murder could not be proved.

7The Crown case left to the jury was that the applicant had inflicted injuries upon the deceased whilst they were on the bridge and then when the deceased had probably lost consciousness, pushed him off the bridge with the intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. The Crown case accepted that the applicant may have been assisted by another person or persons although this was not an essential element of it.

8The applicant did not give evidence. However, through his counsel he did not deny that he had assaulted the deceased on the bridge. It was accepted by the applicant in this Court that the scientific evidence that he had been part of an assault was ""very powerful."" However, the applicant denied that he was the cause of the deceased falling into the river either alone or with assistance. The applicant's case was that having brutally assaulted the deceased he left the scene and some other person or persons must have thrown the deceased into the water. The applicant's case was that after he left the scene he returned to find the deceased gone.

9The applicant's position was supported by evidence of a telephone call which he made to his sister after he had assaulted the deceased in which he asked her to come and pick him up from the vicinity of the bridge. According to her evidence the applicant said to her during the telephone call:

""I've been in a fight. I think I might have killed him. ... When I went back he wasn't there.""

10Because the applicant did not give evidence he could not be tested in relation to this statement. However, it came to form the basis of the essential hypothesis of the defence case.

11The defence theory of the case required credence to be given to a remarkable coincidence. On the same night that the deceased was severely assaulted by the applicant he was shortly thereafter thrown into the river by some other person or persons who must have known that as a consequence he would certainly die. The evidence to support that defence theory was minimal.

12In an effort to strengthen the prospect of the jury accepting this coincidence defence counsel sought to lead evidence of other attacks upon the deceased by different persons. One of these incidents was an occasion when the deceased was chased by three men, one of whom was calling him a paedophile and threatening to kill him. This came to be referred to as the ""Felton incident."" 

13Bruce Felton, who had been a friend of the deceased for a number of years gave evidence that ""a good six weeks give or take a week"" around late January/early February he was woken at home at about 2.00am by ""a lot of yelling and banging"" coming from his front yard. He said that he heard a voice saying ""I'm going to kill you ... you're a paedophile."" He said that another voice was saying to the people to go away and stop belting the motor car. Felton said he went outside armed with a baseball bat and saw two men near his car with the deceased standing behind a short fence level with the front door. He said that when he swung the bat the men dispersed. Mr Felton said that as one man left he said ""You can't run for ever ... I'll kill you ... I know where you live now ... you can't run. I'll kill you.""

14Felton said he later saw the deceased and asked him if the issue had been fixed. The deceased told him that it had been.

15There was evidence of the deceased having previously been injured. Amanda Schultz gave evidence of seeing his face cut, swollen and bruised and experiencing difficulty breathing because of injuries to his ribs about a fortnight before he died. The deceased apparently told Ms Schultz that there were three people who were ""after him."" She referred to another incident which the deceased had reported to her of a random attack in which he said he was bashed.

16Sharyn Obi also gave evidence of having been told by the deceased that he had been accosted by a man who accused him of being a paedophile.

17Michael Padey who commonly drank at the same hotel as the applicant said that there was an occasion at the hotel when he was very intoxicated. He said that as he walked from the hotel he was followed by the deceased who he said had jumped into someone's yard and banged on the door. He said that the occupant of that premises came out swinging a bat and the deceased left. Mr Padey was unsure about when the event had occurred.

18The defence position was significantly weakened by the fact that Michelle St Claire, who heard noise emanating from the bridge that night, and said that the sounds of the assault were audible. Following which, and after only a very short interval, she heard a sound which was undoubtedly the body of the deceased hitting the water. 

19There was also evidence of letters written by the applicant from prison and the content of a telephone conversation he had with his mother, which was recorded, and which very significantly weakened the applicant's position.

20Professor Duflou, a forensic pathologist, conducted the autopsy upon the deceased. He concluded that he had suffered a combination of serious blunt force injuries to the head and neck which were likely to have caused loss of consciousness making it inevitable that he would drown when immersed in the river. The deceased was found to have suffered a total of 15 injuries. There was extensive bruising and bleeding at various locations on the head and neck, the lips, the scrotum, all aspects of the face, into the whites of the eyes, to the side of the tongue on both the arms and shoulders and on the left heel and shin. There were bruises to the mid part of the arm, which Professor Duflou said typically result from being grabbed by another with some force. There was also multiple impact injuries occasioned by blows from a range of different angles. The deceased suffered multiple bruises to the frontal and temporal lobes of his brain. There was bleeding in the brain stem and the pons and there was bleeding in the corpus callosum and a subarachnoid haemorrhage.

21It is plain from Professor Duflou's evidence that the attack upon the deceased was violent and brutal.

22A forensic examination was conducted of the bridge. The evidence indicated that on the deceased's face there were five areas of regularly spaced linear imprints which were possibly caused by his face being forcefully pushed into the surface of the bridge, which had planks of a similar pattern and appearance. 

23The wooden surface of the bridge had three distinct areas of blood staining which were referred to as Sites 1, 2 and 3. There was extensive blood staining and spatter on the bridge itself, the handrails and other supporting parts of the structure. The evidence of blood spatter was consistent with the degree of violence which was found to have been occasioned to the deceased.

24The wooden planking of the bridge showed extensive blood staining in two distinct areas. Site 1, as it came to be known, the larger of the two areas of staining was about 27 metres from the eastern end of the bridge. Site 2, a smaller area, was a further 31 metres away. Site 3 was on the southern side of the bridge, about 700mm east of Site 1. In addition there was extensive blood staining and spatter on the white painted metal sides and safety rails and, to a lesser extent, on the suspension cables. Most of the blood was from the deceased. The applicant's blood appeared on the outer edge of the northern railing very near to Site 1. The applicant's blood was also identified on the inside/top of the northern handrail.

25The evidence from Detective Sergeant Moon suggested that the deceased was first assaulted in the vicinity of Site 3. It is likely that his head was in contact with the walkway at this point and at some stage he was lying with his body orientated towards the east. The evidence indicates that multiple violent acts then occurred at Site 1. The deceased was either moved or moved himself and it was at Site 2 that the deceased went over the northern side of the bridge into the river. 

26There were some imprints from the soles of shoes detected on the bridge. These appeared to travel from Site 1 to Site 2. Three imprints were found to be similar in manufacture and size to a pair of ""Duff"" brand shoes found in the car owned by the mother of the applicant. 

27Various witnesses gave evidence of the deceased's movements on the night he died. He was employed as a ""handyman"" at the Royal Hotel in Queanbeyan. After finishing his work duties he stayed on drinking at the hotel with friends. He was described as being in ""very good spirits"". At one stage the deceased was involved in a conflict around the pool table. At about 1.30am Sharyn Obi drove him to his home but he realised he had left his house keys at work and needed to retrieve them. Ms Obi drove him back to the Hotel where he continued drinking. 

28When the deceased arrived back at the bar one of the attendants, Stephanie Boyle, asked him to cover the employee shirt he was wearing. The deceased's friend Glenn Homan gave evidence in which he said that the deceased was not permitted to drink while wearing the shirt, Mr Homan leant the deceased one of the shirts he had been wearing. 

29As the Hotel was closing there was evidence that the deceased was ""moderately intoxicated, but he was still in control and was happy"" although he was upset at having been accused of stealing a packet of cigarettes. Two members of the staff (Allan Gee and Shannon Heckenberg) both said that last drinks were generally called around 2.30am, however, Ms Boyle said they were called around 3.30am. Mr Gee, a bartender, said that he saw the deceased leaving with most of the other patrons around 3.15am and then talking to the security staff at the front of the hotel for about 15 minutes. There was no evidence of the deceased's movements after he left the hotel. However one convenient route took him across the sway bridge.

30Ms Michelle St Claire lived in a block of home units situated near to the river and the sway bridge. When she gave her evidence in chief she said that at about 3.00am she heard from the direction of the bridge male voices ""yelling."" She believed there were three voices, one was softer than the other two. She then heard thumping and footsteps on the bridge then ""something that sounded like a firecracker, then I heard a splash"" followed by the creaking of the bridge. 

31During cross-examination Ms St Claire was taken to her police statement where she had said ""I remember looking at the clock at about 2.30am and again at 4.30am."" In re-examination she gave evidence that this event took place more than 10 minutes but less than an hour before she looked at her clock at 4.30am. Ms St Claire said that she had told the police ""I also looked at the clock at about 3.00am."" This event is almost certainly when the deceased was assaulted and thrown into the river. 

32Ms St Claire also said that at about 1.30am she heard the words ""fuck off, I'm going to get you. Fucking cunt"" in a male voice. The deceased was known to be alive until after 3.00am probably until at least 3.30am and accordingly this event appears to have no connection with the deceased's death.

33At about 1.15am Paul Izzard heard ""a yelling and a loud cracking noise ... like something had been thrown into the river."" He heard what sounded like three young people yelling ""get him, get him, yeah hit him."" He also heard a vehicle not long after that, he said that it revved a lot and headed towards the road bridge. Again the timing of this incident is too early to be related to the death of Mr Ralph.

34James Cullimore said that during the early hours of Saturday he heard ""loud voices, yelling, breaking bottles"" from the direction of the bridge - and then a noise ""like wood banging."" Almost immediately afterwards he saw a car on the grass by the bridge which then sped off.

35It would seem most likely that Mr Cullimore's evidence related to the same event as that about which Mr Izzard gave evidence. Because of its reported time it must be separate to the event related to the assault and death of the deceased. This was probably the earlier event reported by Ms St Claire.

36When the deceased's body was retrieved from the river he was wearing a T-shirt. The shirt was extensively blood stained and there was a shoe print on the front of it. There was a zigzag pattern on the shirt consistent with either the front or back portion of the sole of a shoe. A similar pattern was made by the sole of the ""Duff"" brand shoes retrieved by the police from the applicant's mother's car. It was also similar to three footprints identified in the blood stains on the bridge.

37I have previously referred to the letters which the applicant wrote. They were tendered at his trial. One letter addressed to ""Mummy and Stinky"" included the following:

""I'm going to ask my lawyer to pull that file if he is aloud to show that when I was assaulted by Jason that when I was ripped out of the car I defended myself and it was him that was left on the ground and that I went to get back in my car and drive off cause I didn't want to get in trouble and the same thing happened with danny so I left him there on the bridge cause I didn't want to get in trouble, so that not my fault what had happened too [sic] him when I left.""

38In another letter which commenced ""Gday mum"" he said the following:

""... things would have been so much different I wish that fuckwit was killed years ago. We wouldn't have had any of these fears or worries about anything or having to watch our backs all the time and been able to live normal lives just like everyone else.""

39In a third letter which commenced with the words ""Hey Phil"" the applicant said:

""Ive just been going through my brief and reading all this shit. Yesterday I wrote out what happened after I finished work on the Friday and what I done up until he was found in the river. And I don't even believe what I wrote down. So I don't know how I'll get the jury to believe me but they might think that because its too unbelievable that it must be true

...

There are too many unanswered questions in my mind about what happened and too many people that would rather him dead than alive so even though I had played a part in his death I'm not responsible for it and that's what I have to prove and then, if I can prove that I'm going home and it's the truth that will set me free so I've got a bit of homework to do by going through this brief everyone that's seen it can't believe it ...""

40Teneeka Beaudean is the applicant's sister. She was originally charged with being an accessory after the fact to murder but later pleaded guilty to accessory after the fact to manslaughter.

41Teneeka knew the deceased through her mother dating him when she was aged about 10-11. She had no contact with him after that. The applicant called Teneeka on her mobile telephone early in the morning of 29 March 2008. She was staying at her boyfriend's place. She said the call took place before 6.00am. The applicant wanted her to collect him and they arranged to meet. The applicant asked his sister to bring him some clothes.

42Teneeka arranged to borrow some clothing from her boyfriend and drove to where the applicant was located. She gave evidence that the applicant said to her: ""I've been in a fight. I think I might have killed him.""

43He then said something Teneeka could not recall followed by ""when I went back he wasn't there."" Teneeka did not recall seeing any blood on the applicant.

44Teneeka drove the applicant from the area. After they had driven a distance she stopped the car and the applicant lit a fire and burned the clothes which he had been wearing at the time of the incident.

45The matter was investigated by the police and a listening device was installed which recorded a conversation between the applicant and his mother. The transcript uses their first names, Kodie and Ben:

""Kodie: so what else did they ask you

Ben: they just asked me like my name like I pretty much got out of it like I said... I went in there and they asked me I said I'm on Zoloft and when I go out cause I said I don't drink.... so when I do go out like I go out and I get real drunk she was like alright

Kodie: aren't they anonymous witnesses

Ben: yeah cause at that time they wouldn't have seen the bashing if they seen me and then if not they would have seen if there was witnesses and they were up on the bridge side of Queanbeyan they would have seen me walking and spew and then keep walking then ring Teneeka and waited for her to come and pick me up

Kodie: mmm

Ben: well all I can say is that I do what every other person does grab the bridge and shake it...

Kodie: mmm does it shake that bridge

Ben: yeah not as much as it used to but it does shake

Kodie: so say I bet if you went along you'd find my fingerprints probably all the way along that bridge

Ben: no they did go all along

Kodie: oh did they I thought it was just in that in that

Ben: yeah every spot

Kodie: every spot

Ben: that's why I kept saying I should go back down there

Kodie: you never go back to the scene of the crime.""
(Emphasis added)

46When interviewed by the police the applicant initially denied any involvement in the incident. He said he had no recollection of where he was on the relevant night and denied that he had been on the bridge, although he said that he had later heard that there was ""blood everywhere"" on it. He denied ever having a physical altercation with the deceased.

The applicant's submissions

47Although the issues in the trial were relatively straightforward, considerable time was consumed in argument in relation to various matters. The trial judge attempted to confine the debate much of the argument being repetitive and unproductive. The level of interaction between the trial judge and defence counsel increased after the completion of defence counsel's address to the jury and intensified during the course of the trial judge's summing-up. It is apparent that controversy surrounded the accuracy of the submissions made by defence counsel in relation to some of the evidence which had been given at the trial. In particular the evidence of Detective Sergeant Moon and Dr Duflou caused difficulties. Detective Sergeant Moon was a blood spatter expert. 

48As I have previously mentioned [25] Detective Sergeant Moon gave evidence that there were three main areas where blood was found on the bridge. There was blood on the bars of the railings of the bridge. He said that there was a transfer pattern of blood on the metal suspension wire located above where the deceased was found in the river. The type of blood staining at this location was consistent with the deceased being thrown from the bridge at that point. He said there was a third site at which the deceased was apparently assaulted before he collapsed. Accordingly, the sequence of events which he said the evidence of blood staining supported was that the deceased was assaulted at one site before he was moved or moved himself to a second site where he was thrown off the bridge.

49There were difficulties stemming from the prosecutor's address to the jury. He initially contemplated asking the jury to accept that the applicant may have been accompanied by another person when carrying out the assault and the applicant may then have left with the other person throwing the deceased from the bridge. After discussion with the trial judge the prosecutor was confined to a case which argued that the applicant was responsible for the deceased's death and was present when he was thrown off the bridge although he may have been accompanied by another person.

50During the course of defence counsel's address the prosecutor indicated that he had some concerns about the accuracy of some of the statements the defence counsel had made. His Honour also said that he had concern about some matters. However, his Honour did not respond to defence counsel's request to be told what his concerns were. His Honour said ""your obligation is to get them right to start off with."" 

51Complaint is made in this Court that although the Crown Prosecutor was allowed to supplement his final address, and in particular to more carefully define the way the Crown case was presented, this opportunity was denied to defence counsel because he was not made aware of the possible inaccuracies in his address to the jury. The submission to this Court was framed as a denial of procedural fairness.

52Beyond these matters, as reflected in the grounds of appeal, the fundamental submission of the applicant to this Court was that the summing-up as a whole was unfair and for that reason the trial miscarried. It was asserted that a substantial part of the trial judge's summing-up was critical of defence counsel. Although this Court was invited to read and assess the summing-up in its entirety, and I have undertaken that task, particular passages were emphasised by the applicant. Those passages and counsel's comments on them are set out below. Not all of them concern criticisms of the trial judge (I have numbered the paragraphs in the submissions to assist in their later reference):

(i) At page 3 paragraph 1, of the summing-up, his Honour said ""Thirdly, you are entitled to disregard any views you think I may have as to the evidence or the facts. Indeed, you should disregard them unless by the end of your deliberations you are persuaded by the evidence to a similar view.""

(ii) In the subsequent paragraph, his Honour said ""Fourthly, your decision must be based on only the evidence given in this courtroom, that is, the exhibits and what the witnesses have said. Except to the extent that an answer may incorporate a question, the evidence does not include questions or what counsel or I say about the evidence during the trial.""

(iii) At page 6 paragraph 3, his Honour said ""Firstly let me say that I am entitled to express views. That said, it is certainly not my intention to indicate any view on the question of what your verdicts should be. However, for a case of this length and the number of witnesses, you are likely to be assisted if I concentrate on the matters that seem to me important rather than referring to all of the evidence that has been given.""

(iv) In the following paragraphs, paragraph 4 of page 6 and the paragraph after that, his Honour discussed the role of the jury in fact finding and how that was to be approached in light of the aspects of the evidence that his Honour proposed to highlight.

(v) At page 7 paragraph 3, his Honour said ""I would also say that the evidence does not include counsel's summaries of it during the course of their addresses. Indeed, it does not include my summary of it in the course of this summing-up. Now, I will say more about some of these matters later, but you may think that not all the references during the course of counsel's addresses were accurate or complete. Rely on the evidence.""

(vi) At page 14 paragraph 4, having provided the jury with written directions as to the elements of the offences which became MFI 43, his Honour said, ""Now I rather think, though I have not checked the transcript since, that some of the things that counsel said to you on the topic of consequences of Mr Ralph being thrown off the bridge or being dropped off the bridge (meaning the legal consequences) do not accord with what I have said here. If there is difference what I say goes, as indeed counsel acknowledged.""

(vii) At page 65 paragraph 3, his Honour said ""Next let me say something about the topic of intent because both Mr Wallach [defence counsel for the applicant] and Mr White were wrong in the number of things they said to you on the topic of intent, and as I think all counsel said, and as I said at the beginning of my summing up what I say on questions of law, and this is a question of law, binds everyone.""

(viii) At page 69 paragraph 5, his Honour said ""Now, the next thing I want to say is simply a suggestion as to the drawing of inferences, and this is not an instruction of law; you can ignore it if you want to, but I would suggest it is probably worth your while paying significant regard to it.""

(ix) At page 71 commencing at paragraph 4, his Honour said ""Firstly, it is important that you base your decisions on the evidence, not counsels summaries or references to it. Unfortunately it seems to me that parts of what counsel said in their references to the evidence were wrong or misleading.

(x) Now, in saying that, I do not intend to invite you to disregard all counsel said. Their arguments should be considered but, when it comes to the question of evidence, rely on what you heard rather than the summaries.

(xi) Secondly, it is your duty to have regard to all of the evidence and see whether that evidence leads you to the conclusion that the accused are guilty.

(xii) Mr Wallach suggested that it was not your function to see how you can work out a way that it all fits. Mr Wallach was wrong. You can fairly expect assistance from the Crown, but it is your function to determine whether, on the whole of the evidence presented to you, the accused, or either of them, is guilty.""

(xiii) At page 72 commencing at paragraph 3, his Honour said, ""Mr Wallach also said (transcript 541 line 30), and I quote: ""Now all of this evidence about the other shoe marks, and marks which could not have been made by Mr Holcroft, came up during the trial. The prosecution is left in a sort of hard place.""

(xiv) ""Our system involves providing to the defence, well before the trial, all of the significant documents and statements upon which the Crown proposes to rely. You may remember strident protest from Mr Wallach at one stage when the Crown sought to tender one of the charts with the overlays on it on the basis that he said he had not been given a copy previously.""

(xv) ""Now, one accepts that sometimes what is provided pre-trial is supplemented by something during the course of the trial, but it would not be right for you to go away with the impression that the first time there was any reference in the material which has been placed before you, or used by the lawyers in this case concerning the presence of someone else, was during this trial. It must have been revealed beforehand to the defence, and obviously also available to the Crown, and I include in that the evidence of the presence of another shoe print, the record of the intercepted conversation suggesting the presence of Luke, the statement of Teeneka, suggesting someone else may have done something, the evidence as to the absence of blood between sites 1 and 2 and the evidence of the deceased's weight.""

(xvi) From page 75 until page 81, his Honour reviewed the evidence in the ""Felton incident"". At the end of that analysis, on page 81 about 10 lines down, his Honour said, ""There is, I think, apart from the statement on the night after he had been drinking at the hotel 'you're a paedophile' no evidence that any one else used the expression 'you're a paedophile' and no evidence that I am conscious of of any one of the one, two or three persons who chased the deceased on that occasion actually believing the deceased was a paedophile.""

(xvii) At page 90 last line, in the context of discussing the evidence of Detective Sergeant Moon, the blood splatter expert, his Honour said ""Now, particularly in my coming to this sort of material because there was a deal of criticism or disparaging by Mr Wallach of Detective Moon's conclusion, and I just want to be fair to bring it to your attention what the detective said and any reasons he gave.""

(xviii) At page 100 paragraph 2, his Honour said ""The second bit of forensic evidence that I want to bring to your attention is that of Detective Langsford. During the course of his address Mr Wallach, somewhat critically, you may think, said, ""well, why did they only apply this LCV chemical to the area between the stains? Why didn't they look at the whole bridge?""

(xix) At pages 102 to 104, his Honour discussed the evidence of the sister of the applicant. It is noteworthy that, just as there was no challenge to her evidence by defence counsel, she having been called by the Crown prosecutor, there was no application made by him to cross-examine the witness under any one of the bases contained in s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995.

(xx) At page 148, his Honour delivered a judgment (the second judgment of 22 April 2010), in which his Honour gave the reasons for his Honour's decision to specify the fact that, in his reference to inaccurate summaries of evidence, his Honour was referring only to Mr Wallach.

(xxi) From page 159 to page 161, his Honour put into effect what had been foreshadowed in the judgment to which I have just referred. In particular at the last line of page 159, his Honour said ""Firstly, I have been asked to say that my reference to counsel there was intended to refer specifically to Mr Wallach and not to Mr White or the Crown.""

(xxii) At page 167 paragraph 5, in the context of discussing the intercepted conversation between the applicant and his mother, his Honour said ""65, the second passage attributed to Ben: 'they wouldn't have seen the bashing if they seen me;' this is a passage relied upon by Mr Wallach but, insofar as it suggests that a bashing of the deceased and Mr Holcroft were at two different places, you may think it is hard to reconcile with what he told Teeneka.""

(xxiii) At page 169, his Honour commenced to summarise the arguments of counsel. At paragraph 4, his Honour said ""I now want to briefly summarise the arguments that counsel have put to you. Before I do so it is proper to remind you that counsel's addresses are essentially arguments in favour of their clients. You should consider them carefully but critically. That said I do not for one moment suggest that you should discount or discard any of the arguments, and I draw a distinction between the arguments and the statements of law or the summaries of facts. I do not for one moment suggest you should discount any of the arguments that have been advanced. Consider them on their merits and decide what weight you give to them.""

(xxiv) At page 171, his Honour commenced to summarise the defence case. In that context at page 172 paragraph 3, his Honour said ""Mr Wallach called in support of that proposition the agreement of Dr Duflou to that effect, and Mr Wallach in fact submitted that that was Dr Duflou's preferred view, but I leave you to determine that from the transcript of the doctor's evidence which you have had for some time.""

(xxv) Finally, at page 190 paragraph 2, his Honour said this ""The next thing I have been asked to add is this: To remind you, as I reminded you of some of the fundamental principles at the beginning of my summing up, that it is your decision on the facts of the case that matters and you should disregard any views you think I have, unless at the end of your deliberations you come up with the same conclusion.""

(xxvi) Throughout the summing-up, defence counsel repeatedly objected to what was being said. He had also repeatedly requested notice of what he had allegedly done wrong, and the chance to correct himself in the presence of the jury whatever errors he had made.

53The applicant accepted that before he could succeed in the appeal this Court must be satisfied that there were inadequacies or irregularities in the summing-up or otherwise in the course of the trial which resulted in a miscarriage of justice.

54The applicant accepted that the trial judge had accurately put to the jury the matters which the Crown had relied on. Furthermore it was not suggested that the trial judge had failed to properly put the defence case to the jury. The submission was confined to the proposition that the summing-up lacked balance and was unfair due to a sustained attack on the applicant's counsel by the trial judge. 

55The applicant referred to the decision of the High Court in Green v The Queen (1971) 126 CLR 28 where the High Court found that the trial judge's summing-up was unfair, lacking in judicial balance and so partaking of partiality as to render the trial a miscarriage of justice (p 34).

56Similarly it was submitted that in the present case the summing-up of the trial went beyond anything which a trial judge was entitled to do in correcting the submissions of counsel. The applicant accepted that the relevant principles were those discussed by this Court in Abdel-Hady (SA) v R [2011] NSWCCA 196 from [134]-[141]. 

57It was submitted that when the trial judge sought to place the correct evidentiary position before the jury his Honour was excessively critical of defence counsel to the point where the trial miscarried. It was submitted that the concerns which his Honour had with respect to the accuracy of statements by defence counsel should have been brought to counsel's attention at a time when he had an opportunity to correct, withdraw or modify any matter that he saw fit to deal with. It was submitted that only if defence counsel had refused to amend the position after it had been brought to his attention was his Honour entitled to have ""embarked upon a trenchant criticism."" It was submitted that the summing-up became something of a continuing criticism of defence counsel and that in particular the reference to disregarding the summaries of the evidence of counsel generally but then later naming defence counsel for the applicant was ""an extreme example of that phenomenon."" It was submitted that the ameliorative remarks by his Honour to which I refer below did not sufficiently correct the situation.

58Turning to specific matters, it was submitted that the reference to the jury being entitled to expect assistance from the Crown without any reference to defence counsel was likely to cause the jury to give the submissions of defence counsel much less weight. It was submitted that although defence counsel complained about that remark it was not corrected by his Honour.

59Furthermore, it was submitted that the submission made by defence counsel about the ""Felton incident"" was not erroneous and was not deserving of express or implied criticism. It was submitted that it was quite open to ask the jury to infer that the other two assailants shared the same views and intention as those expressed by the main assailant and that if those three men were on trial based on principles of accessorial liability, it would have been quite open to a Crown Prosecutor to submit that they were all acting together in concert. It was submitted that the extended view of the evidence by his Honour that culminated in the criticism of the submission of defence counsel on this topic was unwarranted.

60In short, it was submitted that the summing-up read as a whole, and even accepting that some ameliorative statements were made by his Honour, would have caused the jury to accord the submissions of defence counsel little or no weight. It was submitted that even if there were failings or imperfections in the final address of defence counsel, they could and should have been dealt with in another way. The result was that the applicant did not have a fair trial according to law. 

Applicable principles

61The principles relevant to the obligations falling upon the trial judge when summing-up are well known. They were discussed by this Court in Abdel-Hady. They may be summarised in the following manner:

The summing-up must be fair to both the prosecution and to the accused having regard to the evidence which is before the court.

Provided the trial judge makes plain to the jury that they are not bound to accept the view of the judge, a judge may express a view of the facts.

To further the object of a fair trial the trial judge should bring the jury's attention to significant portions of the evidence. This will include corrections to any inaccurate summary or statement of the evidence by either the prosecutor or defence counsel. Irrespective of the submissions of counsel a trial judge has an overriding duty to bring to the jury's attention those parts of the evidence that reflect significantly on the factual issues in the case and how the evidence relates to them.

Because of the potential difficulty for jurors in understanding the evidence of experts it will often be necessary for a trial judge to take the jury through that evidence in some detail.

To consider whether a summing-up is fair it must be read as a whole.

Conclusions on the applicant's submissions

62A reading of the transcript of the trial in the present case reveals some of the difficulties experienced by the trial judge. In particular the submissions by counsel for the applicant on issues arising from counsel's address and his Honour's summing-up were lengthy and repetitive. It is apparent, and this is not surprising, that his Honour felt some frustration at being unable to move the trial forward efficiently and was rightly concerned about the inconvenience which delays were causing to individual jurors. His Honour was also concerned, and in my opinion was entitled to be concerned, about some of the inaccuracies in the applicant's address to the jury. Apart from debate about the parameters of the ""Felton incident"" I did not understand the applicant to submit otherwise.

63The fundamental and often repeated submission by trial counsel was a complaint that before the trial judge reminded the jury of evidence which had been wrongly summarised by counsel, necessitating a correction from the trial judge, his Honour was obliged to tell counsel of his concern and provide an opportunity for trial counsel to correct the position. It was submitted that to do to otherwise was to deny the applicant procedural fairness.

64I do not believe that this submission correctly states the law. As the submission recognises and is undoubtedly the case a trial judge is required to ensure the trial is fair. Where there are problems with the accuracy of the submissions of counsel whether prosecution or defence, and they relate to significant issues in the trial the judge is obliged to bring the correct position to the attention of the jury. Provided this is done in a manner, which having regard to the issues and the manner in which they have been addressed by trial counsel, effectively deals with the problem and does not occasion unfairness to a party no difficulty will arise. It may be that in many cases the trial judge will bring the problem to counsel's attention and provide an opportunity for counsel to make a correction. This may be the prudent course but I do not believe it to be essential if the trial is to be fair. Of course, depending on the nature of the misstatement by counsel and the significance of the issue in the trial an appropriate correction from the trial judge may either expressly or implicitly carry with it a criticism of counsel. If a statement made by counsel is ""wrong"" there can be no error in the judge pointing out that it is wrong, where the error lies and reminding the jury of the correct position. It is the duty of counsel to firmly and at times forcefully put their client's position before the jury. However, they carry an obligation to remain faithful to the evidence, be it oral or documentary, which has been admitted at the trial. If they fail in that duty there must always be a risk that following correction by the trial judge the jury may think less of other parts of counsel's argument.

65Although, when criticism is made of a trial judge's summing-up it is necessary to read the summing-up as a whole it is also necessary to carefully consider those particular aspects of it which it is submitted contributed to an unacceptable lack of balance. With respect to the applicant's particular criticisms of the trial judge's summing-up there is nothing unexceptional, quite the contrary, in a trial judge reminding the jury that it is the evidence and not counsel's summary of it to which they must have regard when deciding the case. Where, as counsel before this Court accepted, defence counsel has made errors in summarising any part of the evidence it was inevitable that his Honour would point out the error and remind the jury of the correct evidence. If this reflected adversely on trial counsel this was but a consequence of counsel's approach to his task. There is no ground of appeal that the trial miscarried because of counsel's incompetence.

66There was an unfortunate consequence from his Honour's attempt to avoid confining any implicit criticism to the applicant's counsel. When referring to the inaccuracies in counsels' submissions his Honour initially generalised the position referring to all counsel. Later in the summing up, it was on the following day and in response to the reasonable protests of other counsel, his Honour confined his criticisms to counsel for the applicant. However, as part of his summing-up his Honour also emphasised to the jury that he was not making a personal criticism of counsel. The relevant passage is:

""Members of the jury, before I continue with my summing up there are a number of things I want to say to you arising out of, in large part, things I said yesterday. One of the things I said at page 68 of the summing up was that it was important you base your decisions on the evidence, not counsel's summaries or references to it. Unfortunately it seems to me that parts of what counsel said in their references to the evidence were wrong or misleading. Firstly, I have been asked to say that my reference to counsel there was intended to refer specifically to Mr Wallach and not to Mr White or the Crown.

Secondly, I want to make it clear to you that my use of the term 'misleading' was intended to encompass something that was wrong and significant so that it might have the effect of misleading you in your consideration of the case.""

67His Honour also told the jury that:

""Anyone attempting to effectively summarise what is now well over one thousand pages of transcript can readily make mistakes. Counsel do it. Judges do it from time to time. So please understand that when I made that reference, and some other reference to errors I saw in specific other parts of Mr Wallach's summing-up, my criticism was directed to the accuracy of what he said, not against him personally."" 

68Counsel before this Court raised complaint about the exchange which is recorded in para (xii) above. Particular complaint was made about the statement ""you can fairly expect assistance from the Crown"" which may seem to implicitly diminish the assistance which the jury may receive from defence counsel.

69I do not believe that complaint is justified. As it happens this direction was prompted by defence counsel's submission to the jury that it was not their task to sort out the Crown case. If read out of context his Honour's statement would require careful consideration. However, all that his Honour was saying was that in understanding the Crown case and how it may prove that the applicant was guilty, the jury was entitled to expect the assistance of the prosecutor. So much is plain. That after all, is the prosecutor's task in a criminal trial. His Honour was also correct to remind the jury that whatever assistance they may have received from the prosecutor in understanding the Crown case it remained their job to consider the whole of the evidence, whether or not referred to by the prosecutor when determining whether the applicant was guilty.

70The applicant also complained about his Honour's statement in para (xiv) reminding the jury of the ""strident protest"" of defence counsel when he suggested that a document which the Crown sought to tender had not previously been provided to the defence. If, and this does not seem to be contested, the protest was ""strident"" then no doubt as his Honour seemed to reason this attitude was taken deliberately by counsel to build an impression in the jury's mind that the prosecutor was unfair. It was not submitted that his Honour's view of counsel's motive was wrong. In these circumstances I have no concern about his Honour, in the interests of a fair trial, pointing out the true position to the jury.

71With respect to issues relating to the circumstances of the ""Felton incident"" his Honour believed it appropriate to remind the jury of the detail of the evidence which had been given. The event had significance because it gave support to the applicant's assertion that other persons had reason to do harm to the deceased.

72Defence had told the jury that all three men involved in the incident believed that the deceased was a paedophile. This was not the evidence.

73As it happens his Honour told the jury that they ""may well think [the evidence] falls significantly short"" of defence counsel's submission. His Honour reminded them that apart from the statement ""you're a paedophile"" directed to the deceased on the night of that incident, there was no evidence that anyone else used that expression or that any one or more of the three assailants of the deceased had believed he was a paedophile.

74The evidence of Mr Felton was that the deceased had reported one man using the term ""paedophile."" There was no evidence whether any of the three assailants who participated in this incident in fact believed the deceased was a paedophile. 

75To my mind his Honour was entitled to remind the jury of this evidence and invite them to reflect on its significance as he did.

76The applicant's counsel filed with his written submissions a table which was provided as a summary of the complaints made about the trial judge's summing-up. It is convenient to look at each of these matters. The individual matters formed part of the overriding submission that the remarks of the trial judge had the consequence that the submissions of defence counsel would be given little or no weight by the jury.

Issue 1

77This issue concerns the submissions of defence counsel in the final address that Detective Sergeant Moon refused to allow for the possibility that the deceased might independently have moved between Site 1 and Site 2 on the bridge and that his evidence on that subject cannot stand with the evidence of Dr Duflou that the deceased might have been able to do so.

78In fact the evidence of Detective Sergeant Moon did not preclude the possibility that the deceased might have independently moved between Site 1 and Site 2. He said that the evidence of blood spattering did not demonstrate that such movement had occurred. The trial judge took the jury to the portions of the evidence of Detective Sergeant Moon relevant to that issue.

79As it happens his Honour also reminded the jury of the evidence of Dr Duflou that the deceased could have moved independently between the sites on the bridge, his Honour then contrasted and compared some aspects of the opinions of Dr Duflou and Detective Sergeant Moon.

80It follows that it was not open to defence counsel to submit that the evidence of Detective Sergeant Moon could not stand with the evidence of Dr Duflou. The evidence of both witnesses left open the possibility that the deceased could have independently moved between the two sites.

81It was appropriate for the trial judge to deal with this issue as he did.

Issue 2

82This issue concerns the submission of defence counsel in his final address that Detective Sergeant Moon was giving an opinion that fitted a nice simple prosecution case that the applicant did it. It was a direct and forceful attack on Detective Sergeant Moon's credit.

83As it happens defence counsel conceded that such a proposition had not been put to the witness and indicated that it was merely a comment being made to the jury.

84Although the matter was raised as it happened the trial judge made no adverse remark concerning this aspect of the evidence and address during the summing-up. 

Issue 3

85This issue concerns the submission of defence counsel in his final address that it had only become apparent for the first time during cross-examination that Detective Sergeant Moon had said in his initial report that the sole characteristics of the ""Duff"" shoe associated with the applicant ""matched"" the shoe sole marks left in blood on the bridge. The trial judge rejected the complaint of the Crown and accepted that it was open to defence counsel to make that submission.

86The trial judge made no adverse remark concerning this aspect of the evidence and address during the summing-up. The issue is of no present relevance. 

Issue 4

87This issue relates to the submission of defence counsel in his final address that Dr Duflou's initial impression was that the marks on the forehead of the deceased do not match the profile of the timber boards on the footway of the bridge. Defence counsel initially disputed that his reference to this aspect of the evidence of Dr Duflou was wrong.

88However, it would seem from the written submissions that the applicant concedes that this reference by defence counsel to Dr Duflou having an initial impression that the marks on the forehead did not match the boards was wrong since Dr Duflou did not give that evidence.

89In any event the trial judge made no adverse remark concerning this aspect of the evidence and address during the summing up. The issue no longer has any relevance.

Issue 5

90This issue concerns the submissions of defence counsel in his final address that Teneeka Beaudean had not said in her evidence that the applicant had made any other remarks or statements apart from those of which she was giving evidence. In the absence of the jury, the trial judge had spoken with defence counsel in respect of this submission suggesting that it was premised on a selective consideration of Teneeka Beaudean's evidence. Defence counsel indicated that he would redress the position later in the address.

91Defence counsel subsequently made further submissions to the jury which reminded them that Teneeka Beaudean had said she could not recall all the conversation she had with the applicant.

92This issue was raised again by the Crown during the summing up. When the trial judge later addressed the issue, defence counsel submitted that he had later in his final address rectified any misleading impression left by the earlier reference to this issue.

93Later in the summing up before the jury, his Honour indicated that he would be referring to the evidence Teneeka Beaudean had given rather than a summary of it and related the evidence of the ""admissions.""

94The other remarks made by his Honour concerning the evidence of Teneeka Beaudean rehearsed the admissions and the exculpatory remark made by the applicant as well as the qualification that Teneeka Beaudean had placed on her account that the applicant had said he had been in a fight in that he had said ""something close to that"" or ""a little bit different to those words.""

95His Honour also reminded the jury that while the weight to be afforded to the evidence of Teneeka Beaudean concerning her conversation with the applicant was a matter for them, they should bear in mind both the qualifications that Teneeka Beaudean had put on her recollection of the words and her indication that she could not recall all of the conversation.

96I am satisfied that his Honour's remarks were appropriate and reminded the jury of matters that they ought to have considered as relevant to the weight to be placed upon the evidence of Teneeka Beaudean. They were not unfair to the applicant.

Issue 6

97This issue concerns the submissions of defence counsel in his final address that Teneeka Beaudean had given evidence that the applicant was always going to the golf club.

98Teneeka Beaudean gave evidence that the applicant used to attend the golf club all the time, that he would go there for dinner ""every week"" and sometimes she would accompany him.

99The trial judge appears to have accepted the defence submission that the evidence supported the submission and made no adverse remark concerning this aspect of the evidence and address during the summing-up. The issue does not support the ground of appeal.

Issue 7

100This issue concerns the submissions of defence counsel in his final address that Teneeka Beaudean had not needed the headlights of her car to see the applicant as she arrived to pick him up after the attack on the deceased on the sway bridge. 

101Teneeka Beaudean did not give evidence that she did not need the headlights to see the applicant. Rather, her evidence was that she was not sure about not needing her headlights and that she could not remember exactly.

102As it happens, the trial judge made no adverse remark on this aspect of the evidence and addresses during the summing-up.

103Issue 7 does not provide any support for the applicant's appeal.

Issue 8

104This issue concerns the submissions of defence counsel in his final address that Teneeka Beaudean had not noticed blood on the applicant when she picked him up in her car after the attack on the deceased on the sway bridge.

105When she was asked whether she had observed blood ""all over"" the applicant she said that she had not noticed this or anything unusual about the applicant when she picked him up in her car. 

106It appears from the written submissions that the applicant now concedes that the submission by defence counsel in his final address was ""not a fair and non-misleading representation of Teneeka Beaudean's evidence.""

107In any event the trial judge made no adverse remark concerning this aspect of the evidence and address during the summing up.

Issue 9

108This issue concerns the submissions of defence counsel in his final address that the evidence of Detective Sergeant Moon suggested a clean lift of the deceased over the hand railing of the sway bridge without leaving any significant blood mark or stain.

109Detective Sergeant Moon gave evidence that there was ""no or minimal blood"" evident on the handrail of the sway bridge above the location in which the body of the deceased was found, which was consistent with the body of the deceased being lifted over the railing and dropped but that the evidence does not exclude the possibility that the deceased may have been in some contact with the hand rail as he went over it and into the water below.

110When defence counsel subsequently explained the evidentiary and logical bases for the submission, the trial judge said, ""Very well.""

111The trial judge made no adverse remark concerning this aspect of the evidence and address during the summing up.

Issue 10

112This issue concerns the submissions of defence counsel in his final address that the letters of the applicant that were intercepted had been written in private and the applicant would have expected them to remain so.

113The Crown brief included a copy of some intercepted letters that had been written by the applicant while in custody. The applicant had been served with a copy of the brief at the time that he wrote the further letters that are the subject of the submission by the defence counsel that the latter had been written in private.

114When defence counsel subsequently explained the evidentiary and logical bases for the submission that had been made to the jury, he indicated that he would not seek to take the matter further if the learned trial judge did not mention the issue in the summing up. His Honour said, ""Very well.""

115The trial judge made no adverse remark concerning this aspect of the evidence and address during the summing up.

Issue 11

116This issue is dealt with in relation to Issue 5.

117It follows that apart from the criticisms otherwise made of the trial judge's summing-up, which I do not believe are justified, the particular matters raised in the table to the submissions do not support a conclusion that the trial miscarried.

The proviso

118I have previously discussed the evidence in the Crown case. The key elements of the case, which to my mind establish the applicant's guilt, are within a small compass.

119The applicant conceded that he had carried out a significant assault on the deceased. The significance of the assault was plain both from the wounds to the deceased and the presence of blood at the site at which the assault undoubtedly occurred. The applicant says that he then left the scene and some unknown person or persons must have come along and thrown the deceased into the water. 

120The argument of the applicant invited supposition which, to my mind, is entirely fanciful. Of necessity it contemplates a serious assault of the deceased by the applicant who then leaves the scene and almost immediately another person or persons comes along and instead of helping the deceased, who must have been in extreme distress, throws him into the water. Although there had been other occasions when other people had shown animosity toward the deceased there was no evidence to suggest that anyone else was present when he died. 

121Furthermore the argument is contradicted by the evidence of Ms St Claire who said that there was a very short interval between when she heard sounds consistent with the assault and when she heard what must have been the body of the deceased hitting the water in the river. 

122There are other matters which support the Crown case. The applicant reported to his sister that having assaulted the deceased he went back to the bridge and ""he wasn't there"". However, he said to his sister that he thought he had killed the deceased. Footwear impressions leading from Site 1 to Site 2, where the deceased went over, had ""similar manufacturing characteristics and size characteristics"" to the ""Duff"" shoes found in the applicant's mother's vehicle indicating that the applicant had moved in that direction when blood was falling onto, or was present on, the bridge. There was evidence of the animus that the applicant held for the deceased. In correspondence with his mother the applicant said that he ""wished[ed] that fuckwit was killed years ago.""

123Even if I am not correct in my conclusions in relation to the ground of appeal I am in no doubt that the applicant was rightly convicted of murder. There could not have been a substantial miscarriage of justice.

124I would make the following orders:

1. Grant leave to the applicant to appeal against his conviction.
2. The appeal is dismissed.

125ROTHMAN J: I have had the advantage of reading the judgment, in draft, of McClellan CJ at CL and agree with his Honour's conclusions and the orders his Honour proposes. 

126In the perfect trial, were there no time pressures and were the inconvenience of jurors not a matter to be considered, counsel should be expected to prepare addresses free of error such that trial judges would not need to be prompted to correct them. Likewise, were it not for such pressures and the necessity to ensure that jurors are engaged in the trial process including attending to counsel's addresses, judges could allow counsel the time to correct errors put to the jury before the addresses concluded. 

127However, in the real world, it would impose an intolerable burden on a trial judge to identify each occasion on which counsel's submission overstates the evidence or conveys a wrong impression of the evidence. A trial judge, to the extent necessary, must be able to summarise the evidence (and the case of each party) without first providing counsel with an opportunity of ""correcting"" that which they have put that differs from the trial judge's summary of the evidence. 

128The fundamental task of a trial judge is to ensure a fair trial. Sometimes that is best achieved by allowing counsel to correct any error that may have infected counsel's address. On the other hand, often such correction in this way can highlight issues that causes even greater unfairness to the accused and, perhaps, the Crown, and a fair summary of the evidence by the trial judge is the better method of bringing to the jury's attention the accurate state of the evidence. This is particularly so when, the statements of the trial judge refer the jury to the transcript of the evidence (or exhibit) and stress the importance of relying on the primary material, namely, what the jury has seen and heard. When, as now usually occurs, transcript is provided to juries, it is less important for judges to summarise the evidence, except in the context of summarising the respective cases or putting in context the directions of law.

129The foregoing is intended to stress my concurrence and agreement with the reasons for judgment of McClellan CJ at CL at [64]. 

130For my own part, telling a jury that it ""can fairly expect assistance from the Crown"", without making a similar comment of defence counsel, implicitly informs the jury that it can rely on the Crown for assistance, but not defence counsel. When a trial judge also states that defence counsel has misrepresented the evidence in his summary, the trial judge is reinforcing that impression to the prejudice of the accused. Studies of juries in New Zealand indicate that jurors already possess such a prejudice. There is no reason to expect any different view in Australia.

131The foregoing is not a criticism of the trial judge. Rather, it points to the difficulty all judges have in dealing with a submission by counsel to a jury that is contrary to the evidence, or a wrong statement about the evidence. It also points to the care that counsel must take when addressing. 

132The jury is entitled to expect counsel to do their best to summarise the evidence accurately and offer arguments about it. That is the function of counsel. That the Crown has a duty to put its case fairly is not a matter that should inform the jury's assessment of the strength of the prosecution. Nor should the jury be informed of that duty, directly or indirectly. 

133The defence counsel's submission to the jury to the effect that it was not their task to sort out the Crown's case, in my view, was an infelicitously expressed attempt to draw to the jury's attention that it was not able to fill gaps in the Crown case by guessing what probably happened. In this case, any ""gap"" in the evidence did not affect the strength of the Crown case, but counsel's submission did not require one out of the three counsel to be singled out for the attention he was given.

134Further, I am not convinced that counsel's submission about the victim being chased by three people needed correction. The evidence was that the victim had been chased, on a different occasion to the date of his death, by three persons, one of whom yelled ""paedophile"" at the victim. The only relevance of the evidence was the suggestion that persons other than the accused held significant animosity towards the victim.

135If defence counsel were seeking to poison the jury's mind about the victim, that would have been improper and would have required correction. I do not take the view that defence counsel was so acting. It is difficult to understand what fact in issue the paedophile comment renders more probable. The motive for the animosity is at best peripheral.

136That defence counsel chose to ascribe, to all three of the persons, the motive (or words) of one of them is even less significant and, in my view, did not require correction. However, that is a matter upon which judges will reasonably differ. In those circumstances, the manner of correction needed even more careful attention to ensure that the summing-up remained balanced and fair to the accused, and did not give greater significance to the error than it otherwise deserved. The degree to which it required correction, and the terms of that correction, depend to a significant extent on the manner in which counsel addressed and the effect of that part of the address. For that reason, it must be a rare occasion when an appellate court can intervene on such a basis, because it is difficult for the appellate court to be aware of those aspects, and this Court should not intervene now.

137The reasons for judgment of McClellan CJ at CL at [61] set out the principles relevant to the obligations on judges in summing-up, with which summary I agree. The overall objective in a summing-up is to assist the jury to reach its verdict by understanding the role it must play and the issues it must consider. This must be done fairly to both the prosecution and the accused. In my view, reading the summing-up as a whole, his Honour could have maintained greater balance. 

138Nevertheless, there were errors in the address of counsel and it was necessary for the jury to be assisted by an accurate summary of the evidence. The trial judge considered that the remarks of counsel and the incorrect statements required correction. It is the method used that is challenged on appeal.

139I agree with the reasons and conclusions of McClellan CJ at CL on each of the enumerated issues to which his Honour refers at [77]-[117]. I also agree that in its entirety the summing-up did not involve a substantial miscarriage of justice. Nor do I consider that a more balanced summing-up would have altered the result. 

140I also agree with the reasons of McClellan CJ at CL at [118]-[124]. I have no reasonable doubt, on the evidence adduced at trial, as to the guilt of the applicant. On the whole of the evidence, making due allowance for the limitations on an appellate court which has not seen and heard the evidence, the accused was proved guilty of the offence beyond reasonable doubt: Weiss v The Queen [2005] HCA 81; (2005) 224 CLR 300. I agree with the orders proposed. 

141ADAMSON J: I agree with Justice McClellan.

		19 April 2013",2013-02-28 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2707103,Ward v R [2013] NSWCCA 46,"Judgment
1McCLELLAN CJ at CL:  The applicant was convicted following a trial with a jury of the murder of Eli Westlake. She was sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 18 years 9 months commencing on 7 June 2008 and expiring on 6 March 2027 with an additional term of 6 years 3 months. She seeks leave to appeal her conviction.
2The grounds of appeal against conviction which were filed are as follows:
1.  The trial miscarried;
2. The trial judge misdirected on the standard of proof;
3. The trial judge gave confusing and incorrect directions on the effect of the accused's rejected plea to manslaughter;
4. The trial judge erred in failing to direct on accident;
5. The trial judge erred in his directions on intoxication and intent;
6. The trial judge erred in his directions on provocation;
7. The trial judge erred in his directions on substantial impairment;
8. The trial miscarried as a result of incorrect admission and rejection of evidence;
9. The trial miscarried as a result of the accused being incompetently represented.
3The applicant also seeks leave to appeal her sentence. I will consider that issue after considering the application for leave to appeal against the conviction.
Leave
4Many of the grounds of appeal raise for consideration the application of Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. The applicant also requires leave to appeal out of time pursuant to s 10(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
5The applicant was found guilty on 24 March 2010 and was sentenced on 22 April 2010. Notice of Intention to Appeal was filed on 4 May 2010 and expired on 4 November 2010. It was not until 29 May 2012 that a notice of application for extension of time to file a notice of application for leave to appeal was filed. The notice was accompanied by an affidavit from the applicant's solicitor seeking to explain the delay.
6In that affidavit Mr Green deposes that a grant of legal aid was made in October 2010 when the matter was assigned to his firm. However, it was not until August 2011 that a conference was held with the applicant. In September 2011 senior counsel advised that there was merit in both the conviction and sentence appeals. However, at that time he also advised that further work needed to be done and sought further instructions from the applicant.
7The applicant was provided with a copy of a draft notice of appeal and written submissions on 28 November 2011. Thereafter the solicitors had corresponded with her and trial counsel. It would seem that only in April 2012 was it appreciated that in order to pursue the appeal it would be necessary to view an original copy of the CCTV footage taken of the relevant events. This is surprising given that the record of the relevant events revealed by the footage is one of the most significant parts of the evidence in the Crown case. The CCTV was obtained following which the grounds of appeal were finally settled on 14 May 2012, the submissions being completed on 25 May 2012.
8The principles relevant to an application for leave to extend the time to appeal were reviewed by this Court in Ng v R [2011] NSWCCA 227 which referred to Edwards v R [2009] NSWCCA 199:
""In the context of an application for extension of time to seek leave to appeal against sentence, this Court said in Edwards v R [2009] NSWCCA 199 at [8], [13]:
'The court has a discretion with respect to extension of time under s 10(1)(b) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. In exercising that discretion, the court has regard to the prospects of success on the application for leave to appeal itself: R v Young [1999] NSWCCA 275 at [30]ff. The court will usually require some satisfactory explanation as to why an appeal was not brought within the time allowed, especially if the delay is considerable: R v Beattie [2000] NSWCCA 201 at [17].
...
The principle of finality of litigation is relevant on an application such as this. Although it may be, as here, that the Crown cannot point to any actual prejudice because of the delay in bringing the application, there is a public interest in avoidance of delay, and the finality of litigation, in the area of sentencing as with litigation generally. In many cases, the prospect of sentence being reopened long after the event may impact adversely upon complainants of crime.""
9As the Court made plain, although it is necessary to consider the interests of the applicant in being able to pursue an appeal, there is a public interest in the avoidance of delay and the finality of litigation. That interest also reflects the necessity for the court to be mindful of the impact that the reopening of the proceedings may have upon either the victim of an offence or, in the event of a homicide, those who have suffered the grief and loss of a family member or close friend. 
10I shall return to consider the application for leave after I have considered the merits of the grounds of appeal.
The facts
11The trial judge made findings of fact in his remarks on sentence which I am satisfied accurately summarise the relevant events reflected in the evidence at the trial.
12The deceased, his brother Joel, and a number of other young persons had gathered at Joel's home principally to record music by a band in which a number of them played. After the recording session concluded they consumed alcohol and eventually decided to walk the short distance from the premises to a local tavern. CCTV footage shows that at about 3.00am the group walked past the place where the main incidents leading to the death of the deceased later occurred. The deceased can be clearly identified, being the only person wearing a white top. The group went to the tavern where they drank alcohol, talked and played pool. They left at closing time, about 4.00am.
13In the meantime the applicant had left her premises with a companion to purchase cigarettes at a convenience store on the corner of Christie Street and the Pacific Highway at St Leonards. This store is directly opposite the tavern on the other side of the Pacific Highway from where the group of young persons had been drinking. The applicant had been consuming alcohol since the afternoon and had also smoked cannabis. She took the keys of the vehicle owned by the person, with whom she was residing at the time, without his knowledge. She was unlicensed to drive and was very much under the influence of alcohol.
14The applicant drove the vehicle down the Pacific Highway and eventually entered Christie Street at the corner where the convenience store was situated. In the meantime the deceased's group had left the tavern. They crossed the Pacific Highway and entered Christie Street. As they passed the store, the deceased decided he wanted something to eat. The deceased, his brother and a third member of the group became separated from the rest while a packet of, what were referred to as ""cheese balls"" was purchased. By this time the rest of the group had gone down Christie Lane, that ran from Christie Street not far from the convenience store to Lithgow Street. There they waited for the other three to join them.
15Just how the three, who had stopped at the store, and the applicant's vehicle initially came into contact was not made clear by the evidence. The trial judge concluded that at some stage, as the three young men entered Christie Lane, the applicant turned into the lane from Christie Street. She had travelled past the parking available outside the store and turned into the lane. This meant that she was going the wrong way in a one-way street. At about this time something occurred that caused the three young men to react to the applicant's driving. The trial judge could not determine whether this was because she sounded her horn, or startled them or simply as a result of the fact that she was driving the wrong way in the lane. The deceased reacted by throwing the cheese balls into the air onto the front of the vehicle. He made a sarcastic remark wishing the occupants ""happy anniversary"" or something similar.
16There was an abusive exchange between the three young men and the two occupants of the vehicle causing the passenger to get out to confront them. However, he decided against a physical altercation as Joel was a very heavily built young man whereas the passenger was slight. There is a dispute as to what then occurred. The trial judge concluded that as the passenger tried to re-enter the vehicle, there was a tug of war between one or more of the young men and the passenger resulting in the passenger's shirt and jumper being pulled off him. It was not a serious incident and the passenger regained the safety of the vehicle and retained his clothing.
17At about this time the applicant exited the motor vehicle. She was in a highly aggressive and abusive state. The trial judge had no doubt that she confronted Joel, remonstrated with him and commenced to physically attack him. At least one of the three young men was trying to placate the applicant indicating that it was only ""cheese balls"" that had been thrown onto the vehicle. An observer, Mr Coyle, believed that the deceased was wiping the vehicle with his top in an endeavour to convince the applicant that no harm had been done. The trial judge found that the applicant struck at Joel and at one stage tried to kick him. His Honour concluded that Joel retaliated and as a result the applicant was either pushed or fended off so that she fell to the ground at least once.
18Shortly after this incident the three men turned, left the vehicle and walked down the lane to Lithgow Street where the rest of the group were waiting. Joel, with some premonition of danger, ran up Lithgow Street having warned the others to be careful of the vehicle. At the end of the lane the applicant could have driven to the right up to the Pacific Highway which could be easily seen about 50 metres away. However she chose to turn left into that part of Lithgow Street where the group were walking on the pavement. This was an area where a number of commercial premises backed onto the street. There were a number of very large driveways.
19The applicant drove along Lithgow Street and suddenly turned left into one of the driveways at the very moment that the deceased was walking across the driveway. She either struck him or came very close to him. I have examined the CCTV footage where this incident can be clearly observed. The vehicle then reversed and the deceased can be seen walking near the passenger side of the car, clearly remonstrating with the occupants. He is then pulled away by one of the group, Stuart Taylor.
20The deceased and Taylor then waited behind one of the two industrial bins that were on the kerbside. The applicant's vehicle remained in the middle of Lithgow Street. Although the vehicle is out of the range of the CCTV, the headlights can be seen. The vehicle appears to straighten but remains where it is on Lithgow Street.
21One of the group had been lying on the grass verge on the other side of the driveway waiting for the others. He was warned by another of the group to get up because someone was trying to kill them. He got to his feet. The deceased can be seen on the CCTV footage leaving from behind the bins and crossing the driveway. He walked onto the verge close to the building at the far end of the driveway. The headlights of the applicant's vehicle then appear to go into high beam. The vehicle is driven diagonally from the street mounting the curb. It hit a glancing blow to the young man who had been lying on the grass. It then made contact with the deceased who was struck by the front of the vehicle and carried forward. The vehicle continued until it careered down a flight of stairs to a gym at the corner of the building taking the deceased with it and crushing him beneath the vehicle at the foot of the stairs.
22The applicant tried to put the vehicle into reverse but it did not move. The passenger exited the vehicle taking the keys with him and fled the scene. Joel returned down Lithgow Street to the scene of the accident. He was joined by some of the group at the front of the vehicle and they tried to lift it off the deceased. By this time the applicant had alighted and went to the front of the vehicle where she tried to help. Joel accused her of having killed his brother and she was told to leave. The applicant was in a highly emotional condition on the roadway when a nurse from nearby premises arrived to offer support.
23At this time a call was made to emergency services. A short time later an ambulance arrived and then the police. The applicant was in a very distressed state and concerned that she may have killed the deceased. She eventually made two recorded interviews. In both she was distressed. Her account was in effect that, as a result of the incident in Christie Lane, she was terrified and wanted to escape the group. She said that after turning into Lithgow Street she saw more of the group and panicked. She tried to do a three-point turn to get away. She said that the passenger pulled the wheel and that because of the boots she was wearing, she accidentally hit the accelerator and was unable to stop the vehicle.
24It follows from the jury's verdict that the applicant's account of the events when she was interviewed was rejected by the jury. Having myself carefully considered the CCTV footage, it is difficult to reconcile the applicant's account with the two separate movements of the vehicle leaving the roadway and crossing onto either a driveway or the grass verge and directed to where the young persons were walking. I shall discuss this issue later in these reasons.
Rule 4
25The applicant concedes that leave is required pursuant to Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. 
26In FP v R [2012] NSWCCA 182 this Court repeated the principles which must be considered when leave is sought pursuant to Rule 4. It is common to refer to the judgment of McHugh J in Papakosmos v R [1999] HCA 37; (1999) 196 CLR 297 at [72]:
""There is no case for the grant of leave under r 4 unless the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the appellant has an arguable case that the trial judge has made an error of law or is satisfied that the appellant's conviction is otherwise a miscarriage of justice. Satisfying the Court that there is an arguable case is extremely difficult where the appellant has failed to object to evidence or failed to ask for a direction concerning evidence. In such cases, the trial judge has made no error of law because he or she has not been asked for a ruling. Consequently, an appeal can only succeed if the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the admission of evidence or the failure to give the direction has caused a miscarriage of justice, proof of which lies on the appellant. Where the evidence was admissible, but the trial judge had a discretion to limit its use, the burden on the appellant is greater: the appeal can succeed only if the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the discretion would have been exercised in favour of the appellant and that, if it had, it is more likely than not that the appellant would have been acquitted...""
27It is important to appreciate that the requirements of Rule 4 are not mere technicalities. In particular, Rule 4 cannot be used to allow an accused who has been convicted having regard to the issues litigated at a trial, to raise a new set of issues on appeal and accordingly seek a new trial where the parameters of the controversy have been significantly altered. If an issue was not raised or an objection not taken at the trial, it is likely that trial counsel could see no advantage in the point or, as is often the case, believed the point to be in conflict with the case the defence was developing before the jury. 
28There is a fundamental right of an accused person to a fair trial. However, under the adversary system the integrity of the trial process must be assessed having regard to the ""battle ground"" on which the trial was fought.
29Many of the grounds of appeal sought to be raised by the applicant involve issues in relation to the legal correctness of the summing-up by the trial judge. All are matters which could have been but were not the subject of objection at the trial. The fact that no objection was taken at the trial will usually be a reasonably reliable indicator of the fairness of the trial and the adequacy of the trial judge's directions to the jury: Teckley v R; Nagle v R [2007] NSWCCA 75 at [89]; R v ITA [2003] NSWCCA 174; (2003) 139 A Crim R 340 at 354.
30Before leave is granted under Rule 4 an applicant must demonstrate that there has been a miscarriage of justice in that he or she has lost a real chance (or a chance fairly open) of being acquitted: Picken v R; R v Picken [2007] NSWCCA 319 at [21]. Usually leave will only be granted where the irregularity ""is such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings"": R v Tripodina (1998) 35 A Crim R 183 at 195.
31In Darwiche & Ors v R [2011] NSWCCA 62 Johnson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and James J agreed) said at [169]-[170]:
""The Court of Criminal Appeal is a court of error. The Court determines grounds of appeal, whether relied upon as of right or by leave, in accordance with ss 5 and 6 Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Rule 4 Criminal Appeal Rules requires the leave of the Court for a ground of appeal to be taken with respect to a direction, omission to direct, or decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction, omission, or decision by the party appealing.
The Criminal Appeal Act 1912 does not exist to enable an accused who has been convicted on the basis of one set of issues to have a new trial under a new set of issues which he could and should have raised at the first trial: R v Abusafiah (1991) 24 NSWLR 531 at 536. This ground, and a number of other grounds relied upon by the Appellant Darwiche, have the flavour of an ""armchair appeal"" , where counsel not involved in the trial has gone through the record of the trial in minute detail looking for error or possible arguments without reference to the manner in which the trial was conducted: R v Fuge [2001] NSWCCA 208; 123 A Crim R 310 at 319-330 [40]-[45]; llioski v R [2006] NSWCCA 164 at [155].""
32The respondent submitted that in the present case, whether addressed through grounds 1 to 8 or ground 9 of the appeal, leave to appeal should be refused. It was submitted that the applicant has not lost the chance of an acquittal which was fairly open to her: TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; (2002) 212 CLR 124.
33The respondent argued that there is a fundamental flaw in the submissions advanced on behalf of the applicant. It was submitted that those submissions failed to appreciate that it is essential when a criticism is advanced of a trial judge's summing up to consider the summing-up, as a whole rather than seek to identify a problem in one sentence or passage which may prove inconsequential or non-existent when the impugned sentence or passage is understood in the context of the entire summing-up. The Crown emphasised the statement by the Victorian Court of Appeal in R v Page [2008] VSCA 54 at [15]-[16] which was in the following terms:
""The submission for the Crown was that the impugned passage needed to be seen in the context of the whole of the charge, in which the judge properly directed the jury as to the drawing of inferences and related those directions to the issue to be determined by the jury. It was submitted that the effect of all of the directions regarding proof of intent was that the jury were properly instructed in accordance with the law.In my opinion, the Crown submission must be accepted. Axiomatically, the charge to the jury must be read as a whole. Unlike the appellate court, the jury is not reading the charge but hearing it. What matters, therefore, is the overall effect which the charge had on the jury, as best an appellate court can assess it. There is an obvious artificiality in isolating one sentence from a full and detailed charge. Although there may be cases in which a single sentence could be viewed as having 'supplanted, overridden or overtaken' other explanatory or qualifying statements elsewhere in the charge, this was certainly not such a case. As appears from the final extract from the charge set out in [12] above, the impugned sentence was immediately preceded, and followed, by express references by the judge to the jury's task of drawing inferences and by a reference back to the full explanation of inferences given earlier in the charge.""
34To my mind, this problem emerges from the submissions of the applicant in this case. The application has many of the indicia of an ""armchair appeal."" I consider all of these issues when considering the individual grounds of appeal.
The course of the trial
35The events which occurred at the commencement of the applicant's trial have significance in respect of the grounds of appeal pursued in this Court. The applicant was arraigned on the sole count of murder in the presence of the jury panel. This occurred on 1 March 2010. The applicant pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty of manslaughter. The Crown did not accept that plea.
36There can be no question that defence counsel intended that the prospective jurors be aware that the applicant conceded that she was responsible for the death of the deceased by an act amounting to the crime of manslaughter. In the circumstances of this case it may be readily understood that this was perceived by defence counsel to be an appropriate forensic tactic from which he sought to gain an advantage. The purpose was to seek to persuade the jury that, having accepted responsibility for the death and accepted that she should be convicted of the lesser offence of manslaughter, the jury would more readily conclude that they should find the applicant not guilty of murder. Given the fact that the jury would inevitably come to view the CCTV footage and the powerful evidence which it provided to the Crown to support the charge of murder, and notwithstanding the concession involved in admitting manslaughter, this was undoubtedly a sensible course for defence counsel to take.
37In his preliminary remarks to the jury the trial judge sought to give appropriate context to the plea. The trial judge said:
""Perhaps some of the facts that might normally be in dispute wont [sic] be in dispute because (the applicant) has admitted that she is guilty of manslaughter. Now that doesn't bind you in any way but you might take it from what she does admit that she was responsible for the death of Mr Westlake.""
38His Honour briefly addressed the jury in relation to murder and manslaughter on the ground of substantial impairment and said:
""Now as I understand it, nobody will be suggesting to you that she should be acquitted of any charge whatsoever. But that's a matter for you. Just because the accused pleads guilty to manslaughter doesn't mean that you, properly finding the facts and properly finding the law have necessarily to find her guilty of murder or manslaughter. It's a matter for you.
The Crown rejected that plea, and so, if I can use the vernacular, the ball is in your court. You have to decide whether she should be found guilty of murder or manslaughter in the way that I have very briefly explained those two events to you. It is open to you at law to find her not guilty of either murder or manslaughter, but you might expect at the end of the day that the accused is going to be suggesting to you that she is guilty of manslaughter rather than murder.""
39Later in the trial the jury sent a question to the trial judge which asked ""Could you please reiterate the difference between murder and manslaughter, and the role of provocation!"" His Honour told the jury:
""Let me tell you, at this point, provocation has no role to play whatsover.... [A]s I understand it from what was said to you by Mr Wasilenia at the time he was opening to you, the accused is not suggesting that she was provoked. What she is saying, as I understand it, is that in some way this is accidental. The only basis that I understand at the present time that manslaughter is being relied upon by the accused is either on the basis that she did not intend to kill the deceased, but that it was very bad driving on her part, or that if you find that she did intend to kill the deceased then that she could prove the defence of substantial impairment.""
40His Honour then gave the jury a brief outline of the law in relation to provocation and said:
""If on hearing all the evidence at the end of the day I believe the issue of provocation has been raised, then I will tell you and I will give you proper directions of law on provocation. At this stage, put it out of your minds.""
41Towards the end of the evidence there was a discussion between the trial judge and counsel with respect to the issues which the jury would have to resolve. His Honour noted the fact of the plea and received an affirmative reply from the applicant's counsel when he asked whether the plea was based on gross criminal negligence. To his Honour's question whether the applicant could be acquitted Mr Wasilenia said:
""That means that they would have to reject the plea as your Honour mentioned.
HIS HONOUR: The Crown's rejected the plea. The plea is not before them.
WASILENIA: It would logically follow I think your Honour that they could if they rejected gross criminal negligence.""
42The Crown Prosecutor then raised the issue of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act and his Honour asked Mr Wasilenia to give it some consideration.
43At the conclusion of the evidence his Honour sought further assistance in identifying the issues and the necessary directions for the jury. In particular he raised the matter of the applicant's plea to manslaughter at the start of the trial and the issue of provocation. He ultimately told counsel that if he decided upon further consideration to leave provocation and gross criminal negligence manslaughter to the jury he would provide them with some further draft written directions. This ultimately occurred.
44When the Crown Prosecutor addressed the jury she reminded them that the applicant's version in the ERISP was that ""this was basically an accident"". 
45When defence counsel addressed the jury he dealt at length with the applicant's account in the ERISP and then compared it with the eyewitness evidence. The essence of his address was that the event was an accident but that if the jury did not accept that explanation they would find the applicant guilty of manslaughter on the basis of substantial impairment. He did not address provocation.
The grounds of appeal
Ground 1
46This ground adds nothing to the applicant's case and no more need be said about it.
Ground 2
47It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the trial judge had given the jury inappropriate directions in relation to the standard of proof. Senior counsel for the applicant confined the submission to a complaint that when informing the jury that the Crown must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt his Honour inappropriately said ""they are every day ordinary words"" and later said ""what you have to do is think about them as a concept. You don't look at them individually and you don't ask what this word means and that word means."" It was submitted that his Honour was in error by making these remarks to the jury and that no trial judge should go beyond telling the jury that the words ""reasonable doubt"" are every day words which mean what they say.
48It is important to appreciate that the comments of his Honour which are criticised formed part of a comprehensive direction in relation to the standard of proof. That direction was in the following terms:
""HIS HONOUR: The Crown must prove the essential factors that go to make up the charge of manslaughter or murder, however shape the manslaughter takes, except for substantial impairment, beyond reasonable doubt.
Now you have understand that those words, they are every day ordinary words. What you have got to do is to think about them as a concept. You don't look at them individually and you don't ask what this word means and that word means. You look at it as a concept and you think to yourself, at the end of the day has the Crown satisfied me beyond reasonable doubt, for example in murder, that when the accused drove at the deceased she did so intentionally? She must have done it intentionally if it is to be murder.
Another way of doing it is to ask yourself, is there any reasonable possibility that when she drove at the deceased on the second occasion she did not intend to drive at him? If that reasonable possibility exists the Crown does not satisfy you that her version, in effect, in the record of interview could not possibly be true then the Crown has failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the charge of murder. It is the same way of looking at it. Am I satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, means the same thing as saying, has the Crown convinced me that the opposite could not possibly reasonably be true? The easiest way to think about it, as I say, is in relation to the accused's record of interview. The Crown must satisfy you to the charge of murder that account could not reasonably be true. She does not have the proving that it is, or could possibly be true [sic]. The Crown has to for the charge of murder has to make it clear to you that you would reject it as a possible account, as a possible scenario. So that is how the onus of proof works.""

49In RWB v R [2010] NSWCCA 147 Simpson J considered in some detail, decisions relating to trials where the trial judge had given the jury instruction in relation to the meaning of the words ""beyond reasonable doubt"" (see in particular Green v R (1971) 126 CLR 28). Her Honour said that it will not be in every case that where the strictures of appellate courts have gone unheeded it may be concluded that the transgression has given rise to a miscarriage of justice.
50However, critical to a conclusion that a direction which is not confined as required by Green has caused a miscarriage of justice will be whether or not the direction which has been given had the effect of diminishing the standard of proof (FP v R [2012] NSWCCA 182 at [178].
51In the present case it is plain that the trial judge emphasised to the jury that the Crown must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. Although his Honour's comment that the phrase was to be viewed as a concept and the words should not be looked at individually was unnecessary, they did not in any way diminish the standard of proof. For this reason there is no merit in the argument that his Honour misdirected the jury.
52In further support of this ground of appeal senior counsel for the applicant referred to his Honour's instruction to the jury in relation to the proof of the Crown case by reference to a set of balance scales. The statements criticised were firstly that his Honour said ""[i]n a criminal case if you put the Crown's evidence and arguments on one side of the scale in one pan and you put the defence arguments and defence evidence in other side of the pan the scales must go that way, must tip over in favour of the Crown."" Counsel emphasised that his Honour went on to give a description of the civil onus intending to contrast it with the position in a criminal case, by reference to the scales saying ""if they tip over ever so slightly in favour of the plaintiff the plaintiff has succeeded.""
53It was submitted that these directions were wrong and misleading because they diminished the force and degree of certainty required before the Crown could discharge the criminal standard of proof. 
54This submission is without merit. Firstly it is apparent that when his Honour spoke of the scales tipping in relation to the criminal onus, his Honour must have demonstrated using his hands to indicate how the scales must tip. More importantly the passages from the summing-up selected by counsel for the applicant form part of a more comprehensive direction in which his Honour emphasised to the jury that the Crown must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. The entire passage was as follows:
""The criminal onus is proof beyond reasonable doubt. The civil onus is proof on the balance of probabilities. One way that is used to explain it, I do not know if it is helpful or not, but I might as well do it because everybody does it and it may help you understand the difference. Think of the set of balance scales, you know, the old scales that used to be in chemist shops, a set of traditional scales of justice, if you like, that is where they are there for [sic]. In a criminal case if you put the Crown's evidence and arguments on one side of the scale in one pan and you put the defence arguments and defence evidence in other side of the pan the scales must go that way, must tip over in favour of the Crown. That is because the onus of proof is on the Crown and it is proof beyond reasonable doubt.
But if we are in a civil case you put the evidence of the plaintiff and the plaintiffs arguments in one pan and you put the defendant's arguments and evidence in the other pan. If they tilt ever so slightly in favour of the plaintiff the plaintiff has succeeded. That is because the balance is moved ever so slightly. It must move. If it moves in favour of the defendant, or does not move at all the plaintiff loses."" (Emphasis added)
55Finally, in support of this ground of appeal it was submitted that his Honour failed to direct the jury in relation to the ""presumption of innocence"" which it was submitted may have assisted in correcting what was asserted to be the incorrect description of ""beyond reasonable doubt.""
56Apart from my conclusion that there was no incorrect description of the concept of ""beyond reasonable doubt"", the trial judge at an early stage of the trial reminded the jury that the applicant was ""presumed innocent"", had to prove nothing and the onus fell upon the Crown to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. On a number of occasions in the course of his summing up the trial judge repeated the instruction that the Crown must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. I am not persuaded that the fact that his Honour did not refer to the presumption of innocence in the course of the summing up caused any disadvantage to the applicant or had any impact on the trial.
57In my judgment the arguments advanced in relation to Ground 2 are entirely without merit and leave to raise them should be refused.
Ground 3
58As I have previously indicated during the course of his initial remarks to the jury, the trial judge referred to the fact that the applicant had pleaded guilty to manslaughter with the consequence that facts that might otherwise have been in dispute were now not in issue. His Honour indicated that it would seem that there was no issue that the applicant's act caused the death of the deceased. However, his Honour did note that although it was open to the jury to find the applicant not guilty of murder or manslaughter, the jury could expect ""at the end of the day that the accused is going to be suggesting that she is guilty of manslaughter rather than murder.""
59In the written submissions made to this Court it was submitted that his Honour erred by referring to the manslaughter plea which, having been rejected, ""must be rejected as having been withdrawn and should have been treated as a nullity."" Three cases were advanced to support this proposition: R v Hazeltine [1967] 2 QB 857; 51 Crim App R 351; R v McGregor-Reid [1999] Crim LR 860 and R v Yeardley [2000] 2 Crim App R 14. It was further submitted that it was inappropriate for the trial judge to make these statements at the outset of the trial and the jury should have been directed to ignore what his Honour had said. It was further submitted that it was incumbent on the trial judge to explain that the applicant was not saying she had done a deliberate act but was accepting that she was negligent.
60Further complaint was made that his Honour on more than one occasion in the course of the summing up referred to the fact that the applicant did not dispute her criminal responsibility for the death of the deceased and on occasions said that ""murder or manslaughter ... appeared to be the two realistic options.""
61On another occasion his Honour said to the jury ""you cannot accept her plea as meaning anything in particular except that she accepts responsibility for killing the deceased.""
62Apart from the submission that the rejection of the plea should have meant that it was not referred to it was submitted that his Honour gave an unfair and inaccurate description of how trial counsel put the applicant's case. On one occasion his Honour said that the Crown had to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt but added ""but she [the applicant] says, at least, well I am guilty of manslaughter on that basis, simply from what I said to the police on the particular day in question."" It was submitted that it was unfair to remind the jury of what the applicant had said when she spoke to the police at a time when she was both inebriated and in a state of some shock. It was further submitted that nowhere in the course of his final address did defence counsel make the submission that the applicant was guilty of manslaughter. It was submitted that the effect of his Honour's direction was that the jury were directed not to consider whether the collision was an accident.
63As I have previously mentioned, towards the end of the evidence the trial judge raised with defence counsel the applicant's plea of guilty to manslaughter. It is necessary with respect to this ground of appeal to consider what occurred in a little more detail. 
64His Honour said: 
""Now, Mr Wasilenia, I am troubled about the plea of guilty. Do you still say it could be justified on the basis of gross criminal negligence? 
Wasilenia: Well, your Honour, it's my submission it is open to the jury bearing in mind, one, there is the alcohol reading, secondly, there is the influence of drugs, thirdly, there's the driving in against the signage. That is, going the wrong way down the one-way street in Lithgow [sic], and at a time when pedestrians are present on the roadway as well as on the footpath and then subsequently mounting the footpath where there are pedestrians present, and it places a duty of care. 
His Honour:  I'm not troubled by all of that. but what I am troubled by is the very high breach of the duty of care that's required for gross criminal negligence. Anyway, you submit that I should leave it open to the jury to find her guilty of gross criminal negligence, manslaughter?""
65Subsequently the issue was again discussed. The Crown Prosecutor submitted that gross criminal negligence manslaughter arose having regard to the applicant's version of the events. The question of leaving the alternative of aggravated dangerous driving was also discussed. In the course of that discussion, defence counsel conceded that there was no defence to a count of aggravated dangerous driving.
66During the course of the remarks which his Honour made to the jury before commencing his summing-up, the trial judge reminded the jury that when opening his case, defence counsel had told the jury that the applicant had entered a plea of manslaughter because she admitted that her negligent driving was so gross as to amount to manslaughter. 
67In the course of the summing-up his Honour said:
""Remember what I said to you that the accused pleaded guilty at the start of the trial to manslaughter. As it was put to you in opening, the manslaughter that she was accepting that she committed was gross criminal negligence manslaughter. That does not mean that you are bound to find that way. You can not accept the plea as meaning anything in particular except that she accepts responsibility for the killing of the deceased. That plea was rejected by the Crown. It is now open to you to decide what is the appropriate verdict irrespective of the plea based upon your understanding of the facts that you find proved and applying the law to them.""
68This direction emphasised to the jury that they were to disregard the plea and determine the appropriate verdict for themselves. Although the issue had been discussed, both with the jury and in their absence, in the manner which I have previously indicated, it was this direction which brought the matter into its proper context.
69It is significant that trial counsel did not object to the course which the matter had taken. There is nothing to suggest that he adopted this position otherwise than because of the potential forensic advantage in the jury finding manslaughter rather than murder. As I have previously indicated this was a legitimate course for him to take and is a position commonly adopted in trials where there is little prospect of avoiding a conviction for manslaughter but a prospect that an acquittal on the murder count may result. 
70With respect to the other two issues raised under this ground of appeal there was no complaint at the trial from defence counsel. The jury could hardly not have been mindful of the fact that when the applicant spoke to the police she was still under the influence of alcohol and affected by the accident.
71In relation to the submission that trial counsel did not make the submission that the applicant was guilty of manslaughter, the position is that he made submissions to the effect that the collision was ""an accident."" He ended his address to the jury with a submission that the applicant was not in a fit state at any time to be driving the vehicle. He said ""when this collision occurred it created a set of consequences that resulted in an appalling tragedy but murder it ain't.""
72Implicit in counsel's submissions was an acceptance that, although the applicant did not suggest that she was provoked, a proposition never advanced by defence counsel, the jury should find her guilty of manslaughter but not murder. Far from complaining about the manner in which the trial judge had dealt with the issues created by the entry of the plea before the jury to manslaughter, counsel effectively embraced it. It could not have been other than a conscious decision to enter the plea before the jury panel. Once that had occurred, the fact of the plea could not simply be ignored. It was necessary to put it into context for the jury. Furthermore the trial judge had to ensure that the forensic advantage which the applicant sought by entering a plea was not lost. The trial judge appropriately dealt with these matters.
73I would refuse leave to raise this ground of appeal.
Ground 4
74The applicant submitted that there was a possibility that the incident was an accident. It was submitted that this possibility was recognised by the trial judge when he spoke to some visiting students about the trial in the absence of the jury. It was submitted that notwithstanding this possibility, no directions were given in relation to the issue of accident. 
75It was submitted to this Court that the effect of his Honour's direction in relation to manslaughter was to effectively exclude the issue of accident from the jury's consideration. It was submitted this was reinforced by his Honour referring on more than one occasion to either the motor vehicle or the applicant driving at the deceased and a further direction that ""this wasn't an accident, it was an intentional act on her part.""
76In the course of his summing up the trial judge addressed the issue of provocation. His Honour said using conventional language: ""so you have to consider whether there is a reasonable possibility that the accused did lose her self control by reason of what the deceased and his group said or did to her during the events in the lane."" His Honour also said that the applicant had not asserted ""she was provoked, rather she says she panicked and accidentally drove at the deceased; in effect, it was an accident as a result of her very incompetent driving."" The possibility that the event was an accident was accordingly addressed by his Honour. However, having regard to the sequence of events revealed by the CCTV footage, the prospect of the jury finding that the applicant's actions were not deliberate were slim if non-existent.
77With respect to the submission that his Honour erred by saying to the jury at one point in the summing-up ""this wasn't an accident ..."" it is apparent the applicant's counsel framed the submission without reference to the context in which his Honour spoke. The full sentence, from which part was extracted by counsel, was as follows:
""so if you come to this question of murder you must at least have come to the view that notwithstanding her intoxication she was able to form certain intentions, and one of those intentions was to drive at a particular person; this wasn't an accident, it was an intentional act on her part.""
78When seen in the context of the entire sentence it is plain that his Honour did not direct the jury that the applicant had committed an intentional act. All that his Honour was saying was that in order to reach the conclusion that the applicant may be guilty of murder or, in the alternative manslaughter by reason of provocation, the jury would have to find that when driving at the deceased she was carrying out an intentional act. It is unfortunate that the submission was made as it was. It completely misrepresents what his Honour said.
79There is no merit in this ground of appeal and leave to raise it should be refused.
Ground 5
80The applicant accepted that she was heavily intoxicated with a combination of alcohol, cannabis, ecstasy and prescription drugs at the time of the collision. Apart from the evidence of her blood alcohol level she was described by a constable who attended at the scene as ""being unsteady on her feet, very emotional, shaking and crying uncontrollably."" At 5.00am she was described by another policeman as appearing to be affected by alcohol, unsteady on her feet and her breath smelt of alcohol. When her blood alcohol level was taken at Royal North Shore Hospital, about two hours 10 minutes after the collision, she returned a reading 0.171. The Crown did not dispute that at the time of the accident the applicant was affected by alcohol, ecstasy, Valium or diazepam. There was evidence from Dr Allender that the combination of alcohol and the drugs would have affected the applicant's driving ability and would have been likely to increase her aggression and risk taking behaviour.
81Although the matter passed without controversy at the trial, the applicant complained to this Court that his Honour had made a number of errors when directing the jury on these issues. To my mind there is no substance in these complaints. Although it is necessary to record the submissions, it is not necessary to otherwise discuss them in any detail.
82The trial judge directed the jury in relation to the relationship between intoxication and the capacity to form an intention. His Honour said:
""You can have an intoxicated intention. You can have an intention that is based on alcohol and drugs. In fact, very often, unfortunately, the situation is that a person forms a certain intention because they are intoxicated and they would no [sic] not have formed it if they were not.""
83The applicant complains that although it may be true that a person can have a ""intoxicated intention"" the balance of the direction was not a matter of judicial knowledge and should not have been made. It was submitted that the last part of the direction was misleading.
84During the course of the trial the trial judge said to the jury on this issue:
""You have a specific intention to do something, even though you are intoxicated. That may be the reason why you have that intention. You have heard some evidence about the disinhibiting effect of alcohol. How sometimes people will do things, form intentions, carry out actions they wouldn't do if they were stone cold and so on.""
85The applicant submitted that these remarks were ""prejudicial"" and should not have been made. It was submitted that when read together with other directions and comments by the trial judge, the directions were in substance directions of law to the effect that rather than confusing the accused her intoxication caused her to have a positive intent. It was submitted that his Honour's directions ""invited the jury to be satisfied of the accused's intent because generally alcohol caused such an intent.""
86Complaint is made about other directions or comments which the trial judge made in relation to intoxication.
87At SU 30 the trial judge directed or commented that: ""Nobody is suggesting here that the accused was so intoxicated that she did not know what she was doing at any state at any time.""
88It was submitted that this did not do justice to the applicant's case because she had effectively told the interviewing police that she did not understand how she had come to be where she was or, how she hit the deceased; she showed confusion and considered herself to be still drunk, as did others who observed her, when she was being interviewed.
89Complaint is also made in relation to the further statement by his Honour: ""Of course it also may be relevant in explaining, if you accept her account, as a possible scenario as to why she mishandled the motor vehicle, because she was intoxicated.""
90It was submitted that this was incorrect and misleading in so far as it again invited the jury to consider her (confused) account and if they rejected it to dismiss the effect of intoxication. It was submitted that it also raised the suggestion that this was something like a special defence for which there was a burden on the accused to establish.
91It was further submitted that the simple and correct direction to the jury that should have been given was that if the jury thought that the applicant did not or might not have had the requisite intent then they should acquit her.
92During the discussion of the expert evidence with respect to abnormality of mind his Honour said: ""intoxication can impact upon people differently and it can make them more impulsive. It can make them more irascible.""
93It was submitted that these remarks were highly prejudicial and should not have been made. It was submitted that they were not and could not properly have been given as a direction of law but were very likely to have been received by the jury as such. It was submitted that they were doubly unfortunate in a trial where one argument being advanced by the Crown was that the applicant had simply lost her temper over a very trivial incident.
94On Friday 25 March 2010 after retiring, the jury asked the following question ""how does intoxication impact upon the formation of intent?""
95The trial judge responded by giving further directions in the following terms:
""If we're dealing with murder you must have come to the conclusion that she at least intended to drive the motor vehicle at the deceased or one of the group, whether she picked him out particularly or was just driving at any person. So if you come to this question of murder you must have at least come to the view that notwithstanding her intoxication she was able to form certain intentions, and one of those intentions was to drive at a particular person; this wasn't an accident, it was an intentional act on her part.""
96The following submissions were made:
(i) the direction was not correct and confused the issue. It assumed a vital issue that the jury had to decide, namely that the jury had already decided that the accused had deliberately driven at the deceased or the group. A vital issue that the jury had to determine was whether at the time the path of the accused's vehicle went in the direction of where the deceased or the group of young persons was, the applicant was deliberately aiming at him or them. That required a consideration of the effect of alcohol and drugs on her. It was submitted that it was quite wrong to commence with the assumption that she intended to drive at the deceased or one of the group. The important issue was not her ability to perform certain physical functions such as steering the car, nor her capacity to form the particular intent but whether she did form such an intent.
R v Garlick [1981] 72 Cr App R 291
(ii) the direction should not have been given as the ability of a highly intoxicated person to carry out complex tasks was not the subject of evidence before the jury. There are abundant illustrations in decided cases of highly intoxicated persons being able to carry out complex motor tasks.
(iii) the direction ""this wasn't an accident"" was a direction of law that removed from the jury's proper consideration a defence upon which the onus lay on the Crown.
97At SU 98/9 the trial judge directed the jury "" Don't get confused between blood alcohol readings for the purposes of control of the motor vehicle and blood alcohol readings for the purposes of acting any other way as a human being. There is [sic] a lot of skills involved in a motor vehicle, driving a motor vehicle, beyond the intention. The most drunk person in the world can form an intention to get into the motor vehicle and drive it home. He's formed, or she forms that intention. That's why he or she is in the motor vehicle.""
98It was submitted that:
(i) far from removing confusion the effect of this direction was to effectively direct the jury to ignore the accused's high alcohol reading which was always an important fact for the jury to take into account when assessing her level of intoxication and its effect on her.
(ii)  Nowhere did the judge summarise in detail the evidence of Dr Allender and other doctors on this issue.
99At SU 99 the trial judge directed the jury: ""but nobody would doubt that the person was capable and did form the intention of driving the motor vehicle, and even formed the intention to drive to a particular place"". It was submitted that this ""direction"" confuses physical ability to steer a motor vehicle with intent. Furthermore, it again confuses the capacity to form an intent with its actual formation.
100At SU 99 his Honour said: ""Nowhere in the evidence of Dr Allender was it ever suggested to him or by him that the level of intoxication was such that she could not form certain intentions. But let's just have a look at it. This is not a theoretical exercise, we 're not dealing here with a test for young lawyers about the theoretical impact of alcohol on intention.""
101Again it was submitted that reference to capacity to form the requisite intent is wrong in law, unnecessary and confusing. Reference was made to R v Makisi [2004] NSWCCA 333 and R v Viro (1978) 141 CLR 88.
102The applicant emphasised that following the above, the trial judge proceeded to make a number of references to the fact that no one was suggesting that the applicant was unable to form the intent and it was submitted ""put sarcastic and unreasonable propositions"" to the disadvantage of the applicant which the jury was bound to reject. The applicant drew attention to the following matters in the summing-up:
At SU 100 the trial judge told the jury: 'Was she driving in some randomly unreasonable, unpurposeful way, she just got in the motor vehicle and thought she'd just tour the streets without any intention of what she was going to do?""
The applicant emphasised that the trial judge went on to then suggest that because the applicant knew where she was going to get cigarettes ""... you might accept that she was not that intoxicated that she didn't understand that"" and then told the jury that because she had said that she had got out of the vehicle to help or assist Mr Long that was ""purposive intentional behaviour"" although it was submitted that that proposition was directly contrary to the Crown case.
At SU 101 the trial judge said to the jury: ""She got out of there with a specific intention, not just to drunkenly wander around the streets unsure of what she was doing, without any formed intention.""
At SU 101 the trial judge said to the jury: ""If you accept that she kicked one of the persons or that she abused one of the persons, again, it was all intentional purposive behaviour...""
At SU 101 his Honour told the jury: ""So we know that although she's intoxicated, although she's got a reading of at least 0.161, although that's a very high reading for the use of a motor vehicle, it's well over the limit for driving a motor vehicle, that doesn't necessarily tell you anything about what her intentions were and whether she was capable of forming a particular intention to bring about a result.""
At SU 101 his Honour told the jury ""she gets back to the motor vehicle ... - its again purposive intentional behaviour.   The accused's case was that she wanted to get out of the street, - purposive intentional behaviour. She wanted to avoid the boys, the group. She wanted to get to safety. An intention to act in a particular way, to achieve a particular result, to achieve a particular object.""
At SU 102 his Honour told the jury ""... nobody's suggesting that what she's doing was not purposive; that she didn't have an intention to bring about a result.""
At SU 102 his Honour told the jury: ""So the point here is that nobody's really suggesting on any count that she was so drunk that she was unable to form intentions, that she was unable to act purposively to bring about a result...""
At SU 102 his Honour told the jury: ""Now you have to take intoxication into account, but you've got to look at it in a real situation, what was going on here and what's each side saying about it.""
At SU 103 his Honour told the jury: ""Nobody is suggesting that she was so drunk that she was incapable of knowing what she was doing, knowing what she wanted to do, knowing what purpose she wanted to gain, knowing what objective she wanted to bring about...""
At SU 103 his Honour reiterated in part what he had said earlier, saying: ""Now the importance of intoxication might explain why people do things and we talked about this yesterday. She told the police officers that one of the problems she had was alcohol and that sometimes it had an effect on her and that, you might think she's suggesting that sometimes it made her aggressive.""
At SU 103 his Honour told the jury: ""So it impacted on her intention, it impacted upon her purpose, it didn't eradicate them. It didn't mean that she didn't have an intention. It meant that she might have had an intention to do a particular thing that she might not have had that intention to do had she been stone cold sober""... ""But, so, sometimes the alcohol can in fact, rather than tell you or rather than indicate that the person hasn't got a specific intention, indicate the person has it. Because an intention, even if its an intoxicated intention, even if its an inhibited intention, is an intention, and we know that alcohol sometimes leads us to do things, leads us to make decisions, leads us to have intentions that we wouldn't have if we weren't under the influence of alcohol.""
At SU 104 his Honour told the jury, referring to the applicant's version: ""Reject that version, reject beyond reasonable doubt, and then come to look at the impact of alcohol on her. Did it make her form an intention that she wouldn't have done if she had been sober? Had it made her aggressive, had it led to her forming a view or forming an intention to do something that she wouldn't have done had she been stone cold sober and thought about it?""
103It was submitted that the final directions in relation to intoxication and intent were inaccurate, misleading, conflated ability to perform a physical act with purpose and conflated purpose with intent. It was submitted that the remarks set a tone of sarcasm and denigration of the applicant's case and amounted to a final Crown address highly prejudicial to the applicant. It was submitted that by the series of examples of so called purposive behaviour the trial judge misled the jury on the real issue of the effect of alcohol on the applicant's specific intent.
104It was further submitted that the trial judge failed to put an alternative scenario open on the evidence.
105At T648 the trial judge said of the jury, in the latter's absence: ""they may decide because of her intoxication that she's got no particular intention, she just wants to get him. Maybe she hoped to apply the brakes and scare him and went too far.""
106At T702 the trial judge said "" Well she could have driven at him with an intention to scare him, with no intention to kill or do grievous bodily harm and just mucked it up as it were. So that seems to me to give rise to unlawful and dangerous act.""
107However, it was submitted that in all his directions/comments to the jury the trial judge never mentioned this line of reasoning as even a possibility. Instead it was submitted that his Honour reiterated with some vigour the Crown argument which the applicant records as an extract from SU 46 in the following terms. The applicant referred to what was said to be an extract from his Honour's summing up. It was not correct. His Honour actually said on this issue: 
""""[A]nd the Crown says if you reach that conclusion [that the applicant intentionally drove the vehicle at the deceased], why else would she do it other than to do him really serious injury? Why would she do it other than that, or to cause his death?""
108And at SU 47 told them:
""If you find that she did intentionally drive at him then of course she would have the intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm.""
109It was submitted that contrary to the above the jury should have been directed that if, because of the evidence of the effect of intoxication or otherwise they were not satisfied that the accused did in fact have the necessary intent they must acquit: R v Bellchambers [2008] NSWCCA 235.
110It was further submitted that the trial judge contradicted other directions he gave on intent.
111At SU 69 it was submitted that the trial judge cut across all his other directions of their being a requirement for the Crown to establish an intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm by telling the jury: ""people are not that much in control of a motor vehicle that they can decide how much or what degree of injury they are going to impose on a person.""
112It was submitted that this effectively directed the jury that if they were satisfied that the applicant had driven at or in the direction of the deceased objectively that would suffice to establish the requisite intent. As I have already indicated to my mind there is no substance in the applicant's submissions. 
113His Honour's comments about the relationship between alcohol and the capacity to form an intention were based on the evidence that was given in the trial by expert witnesses. I am satisfied that the jury would have understood them in this manner rather than as directions of law.
114It is important to appreciate that it was not the applicant's case that she was ""so intoxicated that she could not know what she was doing at any time."" Her case was that she was intoxicated and partly as a result, had trouble with the gear shift, the accelerator and/or the brake. The problems with the brake and accelerator were compounded because of the boots she was wearing in addition to the fact that the passenger had grabbed the steering wheel from her.
115A number of his Honour's comments were favourable to the applicant and invited the jury to have regard to whether the applicant mishandled the car as a result of her intoxication rather than intentionally driving at the deceased.
116His Honour encapsulated the relevant issue for the jury in the following passage from his summing up
""In effect, the real question here, the one for you to determine, is, remembering where the onus of proof lies and what the standard of proof is, whether it's more likely than not that at the time of the killing, that's the relevant time, the accused was suffering from this abnormality of mind, that is, that she was, as I understand Dr Roberts' evidence, in a manic state which interfered with her capacities in two ways, one, to understand and react to events in a rational and logical way, and, secondly, to control herself.
In other words she was more impulsive. She did not think about consequences because of the effect upon her of this manic state. Dr Roberts said that was even so notwithstanding her highly intoxicated state and effect that that would have the same you might think effect upon her. You can appreciate that we talked about this. Intoxication can impact upon people differently and it can make them more impulsive. It can make them more irascible but anyway that is the issue in a nutshell.""
117His Honour concluded his directions with the following statement:
""She had an intention. Both sides agree she did. Again, it's for you to decide what that intention was. But nobody is suggesting she didn't have an intention, she didn't have a purpose, she didn't have an objective in what she was doing. She gets to the end of the street. Again, different views about what she was doing and what she could have done or what she was intending to do, but nobody's suggesting that what she was doing was not purposive, that she didn't have an intention to bring about a result. The Crown says her intention, even though it was a drunken one, is to follow the boys and to punish them. The accused's case is no, my intention was to avoid them, I just simply got confused by the signs, I would have better gone right but I went left, I found myself in trouble, there were more people than I believed were there, again, what did I do, I didn't meander around, I didn't drunkenly wonder what I was doing, where I was going, I was confused about the situation; I had a purposive intention to get out of there, to do a three point turn or U turn, purposive, intentional behaviour, even though drunk.
The Crown says no, no, no, that's not her intention, that's not her purpose. Her purpose was to punish. So the point is here that nobody's really suggesting on any count that she was so drunk that she was unable to form intentions, that she was unable to act purposively to bring about a result. The question is, what did she want to bring about?""
118His Honour was clearly directing the jury that they had to determine what was the actual intent the applicant had formed. To my mind, there was nothing in his Honour's directions which misstated the issue which was inherent in the ""battle ground"" on which the trial was fought, or would have occasioned any unfair prejudice to the applicant. The fact that in discussion with counsel, his Honour may have expressed other thoughts is not to the point. All that matters is that the directions given by the trial judge were appropriate and fair. To my mind they were. I would refuse leave to raise this ground of appeal.
Ground 6
119The law in relation to provocation is complex and difficult. The intellectual steps which a jury must take mean that there are difficulties for any judge seeking to explain the relevant concepts in a manner which a jury will understand. This is made more difficult when the accused does not raise the issue and accordingly cannot assist by identifying the conduct which is asserted to have provoked the criminal act.
120Although the applicant did not raise the issue of provocation at her trial his Honour formed the view that the jury should receive directions in relation to it. As I have previously indicated during the course of the trial, the jury sought guidance on the differences between murder, manslaughter and the role of provocation. At that point his Honour told the jury that the applicant did not seek to raise provocation but asserted that she either, did not intend to kill the deceased, or if the jury found that she did, then she could establish the defence of substantial impairment. 
121At a later stage of the trial his Honour gave the jury a direction which indicated that the only issue in dispute in relation to murder was the matter of intention.
122It was submitted that by the time of the summing up, having regard to the fact that his Honour believed it appropriate to give directions in relation to provocation, he should have told the jury to ignore his earlier remarks.
123The trial judge gave the jury written directions with respect to provocation. He gave the jury the document and during the course of his oral directions read verbatim from it. No complaint is made to this Court about the content of the written directions. His Honour was careful to tell the jury that although it was not the applicant's case that she was provoked his Honour was obliged to direct them in relation to it.
124To my mind there was no reason for his Honour to tell the jury to ignore his previous comments. It remained no part of the applicant's case that she had acted under provocation. Her counsel did not address the issue.
125I am satisfied that the comments about which the applicant complains would not have been understood to suggest that there was any legal or evidentiary requirement placed on the applicant. They simply reminded the jury that in order to consider the question of provocation they must effectively disregard the applicant's version of the relevant events. His Honour made plain to the jury that the onus remained on the Crown to negative provocation beyond reasonable doubt.
126Although his Honour found it necessary to give the jury instruction as to the law relating to provocation there was to my mind no event in the surrounding circumstances, or act of the deceased, or those with him, which could have caused the jury to have a doubt as to whether the applicant acted under provocation. For this reason it is strictly unnecessary to resolve the criticisms which have been advanced in respect of his Honour's directions. They could not have occasioned a miscarriage of justice. There could be no possibility of a jury finding that the conduct of the deceased or his friends could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the applicant to have so far lost self control as to have formed an intention to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm on the deceased.
127Nevertheless it is appropriate to consider the submissions which were made. It was submitted by the applicant that the directions which his Honour gave to the jury were flawed because amongst other reasons they invited the jury to reject the ""partial defence"" by stressing that the applicant did not herself say that she was provoked. Complaint is directed towards the following passages in the summing-up which the applicant extracted and included in the written submissions. I have set out below the passages as they were set out in these submissions:
""One of the issues that you have to look at I suppose and one of the things that makes it somewhat difficult, is that she doesn't say she was provoked. Her account is not that she was provoked and lost her self-control.
""... the accused says she wasn't provoked at all. The accused case is that she was frightened as a result of what happened in the laneway. She wasn't angry, she wasn't certainly wasn't provoked.""
""you may wonder why I am telling you about provocation when in fact the accused says she wasn't provoked at all. The accused's case is that she was frightened as a result of what happened in the laneway. She wasn't angry, she wasn't, certainly wasn't provoked.
... I'm obliged to tell you the law on provocation even though that's not the defence case.
In her account the accused has not asserted that she was provoked, rather she says that she panicked and drove at the deceased ...""
128A further criticism was made of these remarks. It was submitted that ""insofar"" as they suggested that there was some legal or evidentiary requirement that the applicant should say she was provoked, his Honour was wrong in law, and ""at the very least"" misleading.
129I have no hesitation in rejecting these criticisms. As I have previously indicated the applicant never suggested that she was provoked and it was appropriate for his Honour to make plain to the jury the manner in which the applicant sought to raise her defence. Her counsel did not address on the issue although he did not oppose it being left to the jury by the trial judge. The written directions were settled with trial counsel and there was no objection raised to his Honour's oral directions.
130The passages referred to by counsel for the applicant did not suggest that there was any legal or evidentiary requirement placed on the applicant. They did, as his Honour inevitably was required to do, tell the jury that in order to effectively consider the issue they would have to disregard the applicant's version of the events.
131It was further submitted by the applicant to this Court that his Honour gave a number of directions which suggested a need for immediacy of reaction before provocation could be sustained. The passage to which counsel referred was part of his Honour's directions. The passage was as follows:
""Very often provocation cases occur almost instantaneously."" Of course the longer the period between the conduct and the response the less it may be likely that conduct is the loss of self-control arising from the act of provocation. But it's one of the factors you take into account. For example, you might more readily find that she acted from a loss of self-control if she immediately got into the vehicle and drove at the people in the laneway and killed them there and then. I'm not suggesting you would or you wouldn't, it's just one of the relevant factors you take into account.""
132This formed part of a longer passage which in its entirety reads as follows:
""The next matter to consider is the severity of the provocative act and its effect upon the accused. There must be a possibility that the provocation actually caused the accused to lose her self-control and kill the deceased while deprived of her self-control.I interject again. Very often provocation cases occur almost instantaneously. Somebody does something or says something to the accused and there's a loss of self-control because of the provocative at or the provocative conduct but there doesn 't have to be. Of course the longer the period between the conduct and the response the less may it be likely that conduct is a result of loss of self-control arising from the act of provocation. But it's one of the factors you take into account. For example, you might more readily find that she acted from a loss of self-control if she immediately got into the vehicle and drove at the people in the laneway and killed them there and then. I'm not suggesting you would or you wouldn't, it's just one of the relevant factors that you take into account in deciding whether the killing, that's what we 're looking at, the killing, was a result of the loss of self-control"" (emphases added)
133There is a further passage in the summing-up of relevance:
""I told you there are a number of ways upon which you can find the verdict of manslaughter, and it all depends upon what facts you find. One of the ways we just discussed is by finding that the accused may possibly have been acting under immediate provocation, in other words that the Crown hasn't satisfied you beyond reasonable doubt that if she intentionally drove at the deceased with the intention to kill him or do him grievous bodily harm that she was not at that time acting from a loss of reason as a result of provocation.""
134It is apparent that his Honour introduced the concepts of instantaneous or immediate response. However, he did this in order to assist the jury in understanding the nature of provocation in the criminal law. There may have been error if in the facts of the particular case, the introduction of those concepts may have diverted the jury from its task and excluded some of the circumstances of the alleged provocation from their consideration. However, that was not the position in this case. The relevant circumstances were confined in time and there was no possibility that the jury would have been misled into excluding the entirety of the encounter between the deceased, his friends and the applicant from their consideration of the issue of provocation.
135It was further submitted that his Honour gave a wrong and misleading direction ""on the need for a loss of self control by the applicant."" In particular the applicant emphasised that his Honour told the jury that loss of self control is a ""loss of ability to reason"" or ""loss of her normal ability to reason."" Her counsel submitted that his Honour then drew a distinction between loss of self control and loss of temper without explaining how the jury might resolve the difference between the two states. It was submitted that anger is a reaction that can be accommodated within provocation. It was further submitted that his Honour failed to properly establish the distinction that the law draws between an intentional killing in an uncontrolled state induced by the deceased's provocative conduct and an intentional killing induced simply by revenge.
136To my mind there is no substance in either submission. No doubt a person who loses their self control may be angry but his Honour correctly emphasised that anger alone is not enough. There must be, even in a person who has been provoked to anger, a loss of self control. Furthermore, there was no requirement for his Honour to embark upon a discussion which contrasted provocation with a killing motivated by revenge. There was no suggestion that the applicant acted from a desire to obtain revenge for any act of the deceased.
137In the course of his oral directions his Honour spoke in terms of whether the provocation was such that it would cause the applicant to lose her self control. On two occasions when referring to the ""ordinary person"" test his Honour referred to ""would cause"".
138There is no doubt upon the assumption that the transcript is an accurate record that his Honour slipped when using the word ""would."" His Honour told the jury on numerous occasions both in the written directions and orally that the test was whether the provocative conduct could have caused the applicant to lose self control. As it happens on the pages of transcript to which the applicant draws attention, his Honour also used the word ""could."" I am not persuaded that the two mistakes which his Honour made would have been of any significance to the jury. If there was any prospect that his Honour's slips could have caused them confusion they would undoubtedly have returned to the written directions to clear up any ambiguity. The jury's silence, they did not ask any questions about the issue, bears testament to the fact that they understood the test which they had to apply.
139It was further submitted that his Honour erred by telling the jury that the law did not require that the reaction of the ordinary person had to be reasonable and failed to emphasise that the capacity for self control of that person had to be measured by reference to an ordinary person who had been provoked to the extent that the applicant had been provoked. It was submitted that both propositions were supported by the High Court's discussion of these issues in Green v The Queen (1996-97) 191 CLR 334 Brennan CJ at 346 and McHugh J at 371.
140I do not accept the submission. I do not understand the High Court to have said that a trial judge is required to tell the jury that the reaction of the ordinary man did not necessarily have to be a reasonable one.
141It was submitted that the trial judge gave incorrect directions on proportionality. It was submitted that the trial judge told the jury that the ordinary person test put a limit on its operation in respect to a particular accused by considering how an ordinary person might possibly have reacted to the provocative conduct as it affected the accused. It was further submitted that his Honour gave the jury unnecessary and confusing directions by making a part analogy with the law on self-defence, when his Honour said: ""...it's a limit. It's a standard that the community bases, it says, right, we understand that people can act in self-defence, but there's only so far you can go, and how far you can go is how far the ordinary person in that situation would go.""
142His Honour continued: ""you take all of that into account, then when you come to apply this limit, as I've called it, to how far a person can go when they're provoked"". It was submitted that this direction was contrary to the provisions of s 23 (3)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 because it suggested that the application of the test required that there be a reasonable proportion between the act or omission causing death and the conduct of the deceased that induced the act or omission which incorrectly reintroduced the concept of proportionality that had been rejected by the common law: R v Camplin [1978] AC 705 at 717 cited by O'Brien CJ at CL in R v Croft [1981] 1 NSWLR 126 at 140.
143It was further submitted that it was wrong; or at the very least unwise to raise proportionality in the ""ordinary person test"", as the jury might regard this as an essential part of the ""objective element"": R v McKeown [2006] VSCA 74 per Callaway J; Rv Margach [2007] VSCA 110 at [18-21].
144It was further submitted that for balance the directions should have been accompanied by further directions. Firstly, that provocation is not ruled out by the formation of an intent to kill or do serious bodily harm and secondly, that the effect of provocation is not so much to negate the existence of an intention, which is an essential element in the offence of murder, as to deprive her of her self-control; provocation may occur where a person does intend to kill or inflict serious bodily harm but her intention to do so arises from sudden passion involving loss of self-control by reason of provocation; and traditionally the onset of sudden passion involving loss of self-control characteristic of provocation has been associated with acts or actions which provoke the accused to uncontrollable anger or resentment: per Mason J in Van den Hoek v The Queen (1986) 1 61 CLR 158 supra.
145Further criticisms were made of his Honour's directions on this issue. They were in part repetitive and sometimes unclear. They are reflected in the written submissions which are detailed.
146To my mind these submissions must be rejected. Although his Honour referred to self defence, this was incidental to his Honour's endeavour to ensure that the jury correctly understood the difficult concept of provocation in the criminal law. I do not believe his Honour introduced the concept of proportionality for the jury's consideration. The remarks complained about were unnecessary but they must be understood in the context of the entirety of his Honour's oral directions with respect to provocation, and more importantly, the detailed written directions which his Honour gave to the jury.
147It was further submitted that his Honour should have directed the jury that provocation is not ruled out by the formation of an intent to kill or do serious bodily harm. It is not apparent to me what is asserted to be the error identified by this submission. It was plain from his Honour's directions that the intention required for murder must be present (otherwise the need to consider provocation could not arise) the question being whether the Crown has negatived the suggestion that the applicant was relevantly provoked.
148The applicant further submitted that his Honour gave confusing, contradictory and wrong directions in respect of the issue of provocation:
At SU 52 the trial judge directed that: ""...if you get to the stage where we're considering provocation you must have reached the situation that you're satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that her account can be true"";
AT SU 60 he directed the jury to the contrary: ""... if you are considering this issue of provocation you must have rejected the possibility her account can be true"".
149It was submitted that a direction in these terms foreclosed or ruled out provocation.
At SU 64 his Honour continued with directions in terms of immediacy and a supposed distinction to be drawn between the facts and the situation if the applicant had immediately got into the vehicle and driven at the people in the laneway. He put this as a Crown argument which, it was submitted, seemed to be directed at her lack of self-control not continuing. His Honour said: ""Another way the Crown could prove to you that the accused was not acting under provocation is to prove beyond reasonable doubt that if the accused was acting from a loss of provocation (reported as heard) that state was not induced by some conduct on the part of the deceased, but that, in this case, there seems to be little doubt if the accused did lose her self-control in the laneway that self-control was lost, that is, a lack of self-control was still occurring at the time of the killing, then that was a result of what happened in the laneway""... ""So, that's a second way that the Crown could negative; provocation probably doesn't arise here. It's a matter for you.""
It was submitted that:(i)  the direction was confusing and it was incorrect to tell the jury this whether by way of direction or comment.(ii)  the addition of the rider that it was a matter for them was unlikely to remove the impression such remarks would have on them.(iii)  it should have been accompanied by a direction that the question of whether the accused had regained her control was not a question to be answered by reference to the ordinary person.
150It is clear that, if correctly recorded, there are contradictions in his Honour's directions. There is also to my mind some lack of clarity with the directions at SU64 to which the applicant refers. However, having regard to the otherwise thorough and careful directions which his Honour gave together with the written directions I have no doubt that the slip, if it occurred, was of no consequence.
151As I understand his Honour's direction he was inviting the jury to consider whether if the applicant had lost her self control she was acting because of the provocative act of the deceased reminding the jury (correctly) that having regard to the evidence any provocation must have ""happened in the laneway"" and not subsequently.
152His Honour was entitled to tell the jury that provocation probably did not arise although that decision was a matter for the jury. To my mind any suggestion that the Crown case failed to prove that the applicant was not acting under provocation was untenable. I have already explained my reasons for this conclusion.
153Although I would grant leave to raise this ground of appeal the appeal on this ground should be rejected.
Ground 7
154The applicant submitted that the trial judge's directions in relation to substantial impairment were erroneous. His Honour provided the jury with both written and oral directions on this issue. As with the directions in relation to provocation they must be read as a whole. His Honour, correctly as I understand the evidence, told the jury that the psychiatrists were in agreement - that the applicant suffered from an abnormality of mind - the issue being whether it had any bearing on the events of the night.
155It was submitted to this Court that his Honour's directions did not appropriately summarise the evidence of the psychiatrists. I have carefully considered that submission but to my mind his Honour's directions were appropriate. His Honour was obliged to discuss the evidence of the experts in order to assist the jury in understanding the relevant aspects of their evidence. His Honour did this.
156Particular complaint is made about various statements in the summing-up on this issue. In each case the applicant's counsel has picked out part of a sentence or paragraph without reference to the entirety of the directions on the particular aspect of the issue.
157The applicant further submitted that the trial judge gave a number of directions throughout the trial which alone or collectively were likely to divert the jury from a correct application of the law and failed to give other appropriate directions.
158It was submitted that his Honour effectively eliminated a proper consideration of the expert evidence that was to be called in relation to substantial impairment by telling the jury: ""this is not a case where you need some assistance in understanding the detail. It is ordinary everyday human emotions and activity that is occurring here.""
159Of course by this stage of the trial the evidence had been called. His Honour's comment was related to his statement that that he would not ""go through the evidence in detail as this is not like a fraud case."" Having regard to the evidence and the issues in the trial, there was no error in the course his Honour took. At one point his Honour told the jury that a defence of substantial impairment may seem odd. He told the jury that it was a secondary proposition only after the Crown has found her guilty of murder. He told the jury that government changes to the law were unlikely.
160The precise statement by his Honour about which complaint was made was: ""Of course when you get, if you get, to the question of substantial impairment you must have found beyond reasonable doubt that otherwise the accused was guilty of the murder. That is a given."" There is no error in that statement.
161It was further submitted that those directions were misleading and inaccurate, and unfair to the defence case. The first proposition advanced under this general submission was his Honour's statement with respect to Dr Allnutt, a psychiatrist called by the defence was that: ""he thinks it is unlikely that at the time she was suffering the effects of mania as a result of bipolar disorder and he particularly comes to that view because of the degree of intoxication.""
162The applicant did not include the entire passage from his Honour's summing-up in the submission. The entire passage was:
""Dr Allnutt says in effect that on the balance of probabilities, because that's what we are talking about, and I've been through that with you, he thinks it is unlikely that at the time she was suffering the effects of mania as a result of bipolar disorder, and he particularly comes to that view because of the degree of intoxication, What in effect he says is that ""I think it's more likely than not"" that this dispute on this particular night was not the result of a sudden spike of mania, but that it was a result of intoxication upon her, upon her personality.""
163There was no error in that passage. It is an accurate summary of Dr Allnutt's evidence.
164It was further submitted that his Honour unfairly contrasted the two experts, Dr Roberts and Dr Allnutt. In particular, it was submitted that after saying that ""it's not being critical of Dr Roberts"" his Honour stated ""it had to be pointed out to Dr Roberts in fact he was being called to give evidence of substantial impairment... Therefore, Dr Roberts had to be reminded by both myself and counsel that we were really dealing with substantial impairment and not the effects of slow processing upon her driving skills or ability"".
165Again, the whole of the relevant passage needs to be read. To my mind when that is done there was no error or unfairness to the applicant. 
166During the course of this portion of his summing up it was submitted that his Honour summarised abnormality of mind and ability to control herself as: ""In other words she was more impulsive. She did not think about the consequences because of the effect upon her of this manic state"". It was submitted that this was not an accurate summation of Dr Roberts' evidence and put in this limited way invited the jury to reject the defence.
167I reject the submission. His Honour did not ""summarise abnormality of mind and ability to control herself"" in this way. Again, the whole of the relevant passage must be read. I am satisfied that it was an appropriate summary of the effect of Dr Roberts' evidence on this particular aspect.
168Criticism was made of his Honour's remarks during the summary of the expert evidence on abnormality of mind when he directed or remarked: ""intoxication can impact upon people differently and it can make them more impulsive. It can make them more irascible ..."" There is no problem with this statement. His Honour's comment was based on the evidence of the experts.
169It was submitted that his Honour gave the jury directions on the defence as being one provided by Parliament but not existing at common law. It was submitted that he went on to make pejorative remarks about its effect and directed: ""you say to yourself well look I understand that technically she is guilty of murder but that is a terrible thing. She took away a young man's life in circumstances where she had no justification for doing so. She has caused enormous pain to a number of people"".
170It was submitted that this passage contained an error. The applicant has again isolated part of the relevant direction. The quoted passage was followed with:
"".... She did it with the intention to kill him or do him really serious injury and therefore technically she is guilty of murder.
But in all of the circumstances of this case, taking into account her mental state, the degree to which you find that her mental state was not normal so that she was not in full control of herself or able to understand the facts by reason of this mental condition, that rather than be branded a murderer and be dealt with according to that offence she should be found guilty of manslaughter.""
171I can discern no error in this statement.
172It was submitted that his Honour put the test of substantial impairment as an objective test when he said ""so that she deviated from the normal range of control of an ordinary person in the community''. It was submitted that although his Honour's directions may have been directed to telling the jury (incorrectly) what was substantial, their likely effect was to create an artificial undefinable objective standard of a normal range of control.
173As it happens the entirety of the relevant passage was:
""So you look at all of these matters, the whole of the evidence, you come to the view firstly, if you found that it is more likely than not that she was substantially impaired in her ability to control herself or understand the events surrounding her so that she deviated from the normal range of control of an ordinary person in the community as a result of this abnormality of mind, this mental disorder, and ask yourselves whether at the end of the day this should reduce the charge of murder to manslaughter.""
174It is plain that his Honour did not put the test of substantial impairment as an objective one.
175The trial judge gave directions on intoxication. His Honour said: ""You have to be able to say well I am satisfied it is more likely than not that this mental condition, this mania as described by Dr Roberts, was active and it was so powerful that it affected her notwithstanding the amount of alcohol and the effect of alcohol on her."" It was submitted that the direction should have ceased at ""affected her"". It was submitted that the trial judge should have given the jury a full Cheatham (R v Cheatham [2002] NSWCCA 360 at [111]) type direction.
176I reject the submission. The directions were that the effects of alcohol had to be disregarded when considering the issue of substantial impairment. This was correct. There is no reason why the quoted phrase should have ""ceased at 'affected her'"".
177It was submitted that ""since the decisions in Ryan (R v Ryan (1995) 90 A Crim R 191), Gieselmann (R v Gieselmann (Unreported, NSWCCA, 12 November 1996)) and Cheatham, where an accused contends that his/her perceptions of events were substantially impaired or that his/her ability to form a rational or sensible judgment as to whether his/her actions were right or wrong was substantially impaired or, as is usually the case, both, it is necessary for the judge to tell the jury that in determining whether the accused was suffering such abnormality of mind as substantially impaired his/her mental responsibility for the acts or omissions they must take into account the perceptions of events of the accused and the nature and extent of any impairment of her perceptions, her capacity to understand events and her ability or capacity to form a sensible judgment as to whether his/his actions were right or wrong. The relevant passages from Cheatham are at [111]:
""Ryan at 195 makes the point that attention should be paid to the accused's perception of events, his ability to form a rational judgment as to whether his actions were right or wrong and his capacity to exercise willpower to control his physical actions in accordance with rational judgment. The judge told the jury this when he explained what abnormality of mind covered.
Since the decisions in Ryan and Gieselmann where the accused contends that his perceptions of events were substantially impaired or that his ability to form a rational or sensible judgment as to whether his actions were right or wrong was substantially impaired or, as is usually the case, both, it is necessary for the judge to tell the jury that in determining whether the accused was suffering such abnormality of mind as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for the acts or omissions (in the present case the stabbings) they must take into account the perceptions of events of the accused and the nature and extent of any impairment of his perceptions, his capacity to understand events and his ability or capacity to form a sensible judgment as to whether his actions were right or wrong. I think that the directions in total did this.
The judge took the view that it was unnecessary for him to summarise the facts in view of the thorough and lengthy addresses of counsel. The psychiatrists had themselves pointed up their areas of agreement and disagreement. The jury had the transcripts of the psychiatric evidence with them in the jury room. Juries often find it difficult to understand and deal with the question of diminished responsibility. They have to wrestle with the psychiatric evidence. It is difficult when experienced psychiatrists disagree. In the present case the disagreement extended to the weight and interpretation to be given to the appellant's actions and statements between 5 to 8 March 1998 (both inclusive). On any view it was a difficult question whether the accused's abnormality of mind was such as substantially impaired his mental responsibility.
The judge identified the issues for the jury. He reminded them of the differing views of the psychiatrists and briefly summarised the ultimate difference. The judge was not required to do more. The law was sufficiently related to the facts.
If experienced senior counsel who appeared for the appellant at the trial had thought that more needed to be said by way of explanation about the need to consider the appellant's perceptions of events and whether they were impaired and the appellant's ability to form a rational (or sensible) judgment as to whether his actions were wrong, senior counsel could have asked the judge to explain those matters further."" (emphases added)
178Dr Roberts did not suggest that the applicant's ""ability to form a rational or sensible judgment as to whether [her] actions were right or wrong was substantially impaired."" There was thus no reason for his Honour to direct the jury in that regard.
179The following evidence was given by Dr Roberts:
""HIS HONOUR
Q: We're only dealing with substantial impairment on the basis that the jury have rejected her version. I'm not sure that I understand how this has got anything to do with substantial impairment?
A.  Because your Honour I would be of the view on psychiatric grounds that the slow processing speed is the substantial impairment with which she suffers.
WASILENIA
Q. Well if the slow processing speed is the substantial impairment with which she suffers what do you say would be her capacity to understand events?A. This  would be impeded because  she  couldn't compute  the information that was being presented to her in rapid sequence at that time.
Q.  What about her ability to control herself?A.  If you can't compute the information that's been presented to you I think it would be very difficult to exercise judgment and exercise control. If we assume that there's an additional or two additional Axis 1 diagnosis such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and/or bipolar disorder, those would also be contributing factors to her ability to control herself and to deal with the situation."" (emphases added).
180Accordingly, there was no issue as to what effects the undisputed abnormality of mind might have had. The issue was whether it did operate on the morning in question. This was made clear by his Honour.
181No issue was taken with the directions his Honour gave at the trial. I would refuse leave to raise this ground of appeal.
Ground 8
182This ground of appeal is primarily concerned with the admission of evidence of the interview of the applicant at the police station after the incident. It was submitted that the applicant was both affected by alcohol and tired. It was further submitted that she was denied access to legal advice.
183For these reasons it was submitted that, despite the fact that no objection was taken, his Honour should have rejected the whole or at least parts of the record of interview. Particular concern is expressed about the statement by the applicant when she said ""I can get emotional and fight."" His Honour reminded the jury of this evidence in his summing-up saying that ""the Crown submits the simple explanation for her behaviour is her intoxication and that she is an aggressive drunk. The Crown says in effect she says so much in her record of interview.""
184Notwithstanding that objection was not taken, it was submitted that his Honour should have intervened in the interest of a fair trial for the applicant: Libke v The Queen (2007) 230 CLR 559 at 577 [35]; see also Shaw v The Queen (1952) 85 CLR 365 at 381; R v Chai [2002] NSWCCA 512.
185To my mind this ground of appeal is without substance and leave to raise it should be refused.
186It is not correct as the applicant submitted that ""No access to a lawyer, or any form of legal advice was ever provided... The statement 'I, I really want to have a lawyer'"" was made at A231. After the required questioning by an independent senior officer, the interview concluded at Q/A257. At the conclusion of page 26 it is noted ""INTERVIEW RESUMED"" and at p. 27 the time is noted as 1.54pm Saturday 7 June 2008.
187Detective Harmer (the officer in charge) gave evidence that between the first and second interviews the applicant contacted and spoke with her solicitor ""Mr Proctor"". Detective Harmer also spoke with him and was told that the applicant did not wish to attend a ""crime-scene walkthrough"" but was willing to partake in ""any further interview if we needed"" and a forensic procedure later in the day. During the interval the police obtained the CCTV footage. The applicant's responses to that, together with her remarks which are complained of, followed the provision of legal advice to the applicant.
188It was asserted that the trial judge, of his own motion, should have rejected ""some or all of ... the Record of Interview"" because it or they were inadmissible. Apart from a possible lack of sleep, the unchallenged evidence of Dr Allender was that by 1.54 pm on Saturday 7 June 2008 the applicant's level of blood alcohol reading would have been between 0.00 and 0.066 with the most likely level being 0.029 (grams of alcohol per one hundred millilitres of blood). Leaving that to one side there is nothing in the interview which could to my mind lead to the conclusion that in the circumstances of this case the admission of the evidence occasioned a miscarriage of justice. Clearly defence counsel did not believe that a successful objection could be formulated to its admission.
189It is not part of a trial judge's function to go through an interview, offered by the accused as his/her sole version of events (ie in the absence of giving evidence) and pick and choose between its contents in the absence of objection.
190Dr Allender was called by the Crown as an expert on the effects of alcohol and drugs. He was asked to and did comment on the CCTV footage of the passage of the applicant's vehicle with respect to the applicant's driving including whether it showed substantial impairment. He responded at T508 ""not really. It struck me as somewhat predatory."" No objection was taken to the question or the answer.
191It was submitted that although the balance of Dr Allender's evidence was admitted as expert evidence, which it was accepted he was qualified to give, he was not qualified to give this opinion. He was not an expert on driving, nor on conclusions that might be drawn from looking at a few seconds of CCTV footage.
192Sergeant Jenkins of the Crash Scene Investigation Unit gave evidence that with a blood alcohol reading of 0.145, persons are severely impaired in their driving ability. Despite there having been no objection raised by the Crown and the evidence being part of his report provided by the Crown to the defence the trial judge rejected it. 
193It was submitted that absent an objection by the Crown the evidence should not have been rejected by the trial judge. It was submitted that there was an inexplicable contrast between how this evidence and that of the ERISP were dealt with.
194To my mind Dr Allender was not qualified to give the opinion and the question and answer should not have been allowed. However, objection was not taken. If it had been it would have inevitably highlighted the sensitivity of the issues and probably emphasised that the CCTV was damming of any prospect of the applicant being found not guilty of murder. The CCTV footage is powerful if not overwhelming evidence that the applicant having once driven at the deceased, reversed, and then returned to deliberately target him with the motor vehicle. Although it should not have been admitted, the evidence from the CCTV footage was so compelling that Dr Allender's evidence added little if anything to the conclusion which the jury must have drawn for themselves when viewing the film.
195His Honour rejected the evidence of Sergeant Jenkins, concluding that he was not qualified to express the opinion. Nothing has been put before this Court to indicate that his Honour's decision was not correct. Furthermore, Dr Allender gave evidence in which he clearly stated that he would have expected significant impairment of the applicant's condition ""due to alcohol, and exacerbated by cannabis to have been present at the time of the incident.""
Ground 9
196It was submitted that the failure of counsel to object to the asserted error in the summing-up or to take appropriate objection was a result of the incompetent representation of the applicant by trial counsel denying her a fair chance of an acquittal. Apart from the fact that the asserted errors in the trial are without substance the essential inquiry is not whether trial counsel was incompetent but rather whether the asserted defect or irregularity has occasioned a miscarriage of justice: TKWJ v The Queen at [25]-[27].
197As I have made plain I am not persuaded that by reason of any of the asserted failures to take objection either to the admission of evidence, or to raise issues with the summing-up, the applicant lost the fair chance of acquittal. I would refuse leave to raise this ground of appeal.
The Proviso
198Even if his Honour had made an error of any significance I am entirely satisfied that there has been no substantial miscarriage of justice so that the Court should apply the proviso under s 6(l) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
199The single most important piece of evidence was the CCTV footage. It showed the car, which the applicant was driving the wrong way in Lithgow Street, cross the kerb and move onto the driveway of an industrial building, heading directly toward the deceased and his companions.
200The deceased managed to jump out of the way after the car hit him in the legs. He then appeared to stand (with Stuart Taylor) behind the skip, bins which were situated just to the north of the driveway. Although not visible on the CCTV footage the applicant must have then reversed the car. Its headlights can be seen as the car straightened up on the right and remained stationary for a short period.
201At this time the deceased (and Stuart Taylor) were starting to walk together down Lithgow Street again.  The car was then driven straight up over the grass verge and onto the footpath and again without deviation headed directly at the deceased, knocking him down onto the steps leading to the gymnasium and finally landing on top of him.
202The expert evidence (from the police officers) was to the effect that there was no mechanical defect or failure in the vehicle which could have been a contributing factor. Although the CCTV footage does not enable a viewer to see what was happening inside the car, the vehicle's movements do not suggest, as the applicant suggested, that her passenger grabbed the steering wheel or that her foot jammed on the accelerator. The car's movements were direct and continuous. There are two occasions when the vehicle was headed for the deceased. The inevitable conclusion is that the applicant intended to drive at the deceased and his companions. Officer Simon Parker, a collision reconstruction expert, calculated that the vehicle must have travelled across the footpath at a speed of 27 kilometres per hour. There was no indication of deceleration before the collision or any attempt to avoid the accident. The sequence of events captured in the CCTV footage allows only the conclusion that the applicant deliberately drove at the deceased.
203This evidence, combined with that of the events in Christie Lane shortly beforehand which, on any version other than the applicant's, caused her to react aggressively, undoubtedly lead to the conclusion that she at least intended to inflict grievous bodily harm on the deceased. On all the evidence presented, including that of the psychiatrists, the jury was entitled to find that the Crown had negatived provocation and the applicant had failed to establish ""substantial impairment"". I have reached the same conclusion..
Sentence
204The applicant seeks leave to raise six grounds of appeal in relation to her sentence. Ground one is best dealt with after the other grounds have been considered.
Ground Two:  The sentencing judge erred in finding that the offence was in the mid-range of offending.
205The sentencing judge was of the opinion that the offence committed by the applicant was in the mid-range of offending. His Honour said that he made this finding ""despite the fact that I am prepared to sentence her on the basis of an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm rather than an intention to kill. It was an intention to inflict very serious injury and the risk of death was very high.""
206His Honour said that the only matter of mitigation was the applicant's remorse. His Honour said that the applicant almost immediately regretted her actions and had continued thereafter to express her remorse.
207The applicant submitted that his Honour's finding that the offence was in the mid-range was inconsistent with the fact that his Honour found that the applicant did not intend to kill and that the offence was impulsive and was otherwise inconsistent with the circumstances of the offence.
208In the course of his remarks on sentence his Honour said when discussing the seriousness of the offence, that the typical case of murder coming before the Supreme Court is probably lower than mid range. He said that:
""These tend to be domestic killings usually in the heat of the moment and often fuelled by alcohol. This offence seems to be more serious than that. Very few murders are planned although they may occur in the course of planned activities. Those where the killing is planned would almost inevitably be well above mid range.""
209His Honour concluded that the offence was more serious than the typical cases because it was not an instantaneous reaction to the events in the lane.
210This finding of his Honour was criticised, it being submitted that as the events occurred in a short time frame his Honour's finding was not open.
211Other criticisms were made of his Honour's reasoning including his Honour's findings that; there was the use of a weapon of a dangerous kind; it involved a grave risk of injury or death to another person; there was little difference between an intention to kill and an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm; the applicant's past offending was all the result of alcohol was seen as an aggravating factor; his Honour ignored or rejected any effect of provocation.
212Before an offender may successfully challenge a finding as to the range within which an offence should be assessed it is necessary to establish that the finding which the sentencing judge made was not open to him. The evaluation of the seriousness of an offence is a matter for the sentencing judge and only if there is some error of principle can this Court intervene: House v The King (1936) HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 505.
213To my mind the submission which the applicant makes in support of this ground of appeal cannot be sustained.
214It is not necessary that there be an intention to kill and premeditation before an offence could be viewed as within the middle range of offending.
215I can discern no error in his Honour's finding that the offence was not an instantaneous reaction to events in the lane. After those events the applicant returned to the driver's seat, turned left the wrong way into a one way street and drove straight at the deceased. On this occasion he managed to jump out of the way of the car after it hit him on the leg. She then reversed the vehicle and after some time, and when the deceased was again walking down the footpath, she drove the car directly at him.
216In relation to the car being a weapon to my mind his Honour was entitled to make this finding. Many cases of murder involve the use of a weapon although this is not exclusively the case. In many cases the weapon is a household implement or a gun but not a motor vehicle. When used as a weapon a motor vehicle is properly described as a weapon of a ""particularly dangerous kind.""
217To my mind the finding that the offence was aggravated by the fact that it involved a grave risk of injury or death to another person was clearly open to his Honour. Jesse Horn gave evidence that the vehicle struck him on his right knee and caused him to be flipped over and land on the grass. His Honour said ""he was fortunate not to be killed or more seriously injured.""
218I am also satisfied that his Honour's finding that there was little or no provocation was open to him having regard to the factual findings which his Honour made.
219Accordingly, I am not persuaded that his Honour erred in the finding that the offence fell within the mid-range of offending. That finding was open.
Ground 3:  The sentencing judge erred in finding that the applicant being under the influence of alcohol did not diminish her culpability
220In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge detailed the applicant's history of offending when intoxicated. His Honour accepted the evidence of Dr Allnutt that the applicant's mental disorder had nothing to do with her offending. She was not suffering from mania at the time. His Honour found however, that ""she is simply aggressive when under the influence of alcohol. She was aware that whenever she is under the influence of alcohol she is likely to act in an impulsive, aggressive manner to people or things that irritate her.""
221This Court has previously indicated that even in circumstances of offending against adult victims, voluntary intoxication rarely operates to mitigate penalty: R v GWM [2012] NSWCCA 240 [78].
222With respect to provocation it is apparent that the jury were in no doubt that the applicant was not provoked for the purposes of a finding of murder. When sentencing, the trial judge was required to make findings of fact which were not inconsistent with the jury's verdict. His Honour did this by finding that there was no provocation, or if there was, it was of a minor nature and out of proportion to the consequences of the act and could not mitigate the offence. It is plain that this finding was open to his Honour.
223In the present case the sentencing judge found that the fact that the applicant was under the influence of alcohol was not related to the offence so as to diminish her culpability. The applicant submitted that this finding was not open as his Honour could not be satisfied that it was consistent with the jury's verdict. It was further submitted that the finding was incorrect and contradicted the weight of the evidence, the way the Crown presented its case, the established circumstances of the offence, and the trial judge's summing up to the jury. It was submitted that the Crown case was opened on the basis that the applicant was highly intoxicated at the time and the evidence indicated that alcohol was likely to have had an impact upon the applicant. The Crown relied upon her intoxication in submitting to the jury that the evidence demonstrated that when intoxicated the applicant became an aggressive drunk.
224It was submitted that the finding by his Honour ignored the opinion of Dr Allender who said that he believed that at the time of driving the applicant was under the combined influence of alcohol and cannabis, and her driving ability would have been substantially impaired. It was also submitted that the finding ignored the opinion of Dr Allnutt when he said that ""the most significant factor was the disinhibiting effect of intoxication caused by the combined effects of alcohol, cannabis and benzodiazepines and her emotional response and the interaction that produced.""
225It was further submitted that the applicant's statement to the police that she could become aggressive when drunk was irrelevant and that the only issue was the actual effect of alcohol upon her in the present case. It was submitted that she did not have any history of committing acts involving aggression while drunk with a motor vehicle.
226Finally, it was submitted that the applicant's intoxication should have been found to have been relevant and have been taken into account to mitigate the objective criminality of the offence and indicate that the conduct was impulsive and unplanned. It was further submitted that it was relevant to explain the context of the crime and informed the impulsive nature of the applicant's actions.
227I am not persuaded that the applicant's culpability in running down the deceased in the motor vehicle could be diminished by the fact that she committed the offence while intoxicated with a mid-range prescribed concentration of alcohol. His Honour's finding that the applicant's offending was not a consequence of a mental disorder but resulted from her tendency to aggression when under the influence of alcohol was clearly open. The applicant said as much. The circumstances of the offence confirmed the applicant's assessment of her own response to significant consumption of alcohol. Rather than being a mitigating factor, the applicant, being aware of the disinhibiting effect of alcohol upon her, nevertheless chose to drive while under the influence of alcohol and drugs. Rather than being a matter of mitigation it would have been open to his Honour to conclude that it was an aggravating feature. The finding that it did not diminish her culpability was clearly open and no error has been demonstrated.
Ground 4:  The sentencing judge erred in making no allowance for the offender's mental condition
228The sentencing judge rejected any direct association between the offender's mental disabilities and the commission of the offence. His Honour found that the applicant's mental disorder had nothing to do with her offending and in no way diminished her culpability.
229It was submitted that this finding was not open and that his Honour could not be satisfied that it was consistent with the jury's verdict. Furthermore, there were competing versions presented by the experts. It was submitted that his Honour reflected these differences in his instructions to the jury.
230There is a fundamental difficulty with the applicant's submissions. Although a trial juge is bound to find the facts relevant to the sentencing of an offender, the constraint is upon a finding of fact which is inconsistent with the jury's verdict. It is not the case that the finding must be one which the judge is certain reflects the jury's thinking. 
231In relation to this ground of appeal it was necessary for the applicant to demonstrate error in the approach taken by the trial judge. The presence of a mental condition or disorder may bear upon the question of sentence: Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 at [177]. However, as Gleeson CJ observed in R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 68, ""it is therefore erroneous in principle to approach the law of sentencing as though automatic consequences follow from the presence or absence of particular factual circumstances."" See the discussion of this issue by Johnson J in Beldon v R [2012] NSWCCA 194.
232The sentencing judge gave careful consideration to the impact of the applicant's mental illness when determining the appropriate sentence. He accepted the evidence of Dr Allnutt and found that her mental illness was not causally connected with the offending. His Honour was entitled to accept that evidence in preference to that of Dr Roberts where there was disagreement. His Honour found that there was no evidence before him that the applicant's mental disorder would make her time in prison more onerous and that it did not negate or diminish general deterrence to any significant degree.
233In these circumstances I am not persuaded that his Honour's approach to the issue of mental illness was erroneous. His Honour made findings which were clearly not inconsistent with the jury's verdict, were open and no error can be demonstrated.
Ground 5:  The sentencing judge erred in his approach to the standard non-parole period
234The applicant accepts that the sentencing judge approached the issue of the standard non-parole period in the manner approved by this Court in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 which was found to be erroneous in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120. It was further submitted that his Honour adopted a stepped approach commencing with an assessment as to whether the offence was in the mid range of objective seriousness. It was further submitted that he gave primacy or determinative significance to that matter and impermissibly took into account the characteristics of the applicant in his initial assessment of the offence being in the middle range of objective seriousness.
235Although the respondent accepts that his Honour approached the matter in a manner inconsistent with Muldrock, which was decided after his Honour passed sentence, I am not persuaded that his Honour impermissibly had regard to the characteristics of the offender in his initial assessment of the offence as being within the middle range of objective seriousness. His Honour carefully stated his reasons for finding the offence fell within the mid-range of offending. None of the matters that he referred to involved the subjective circumstances of the applicant.
236Notwithstanding that his Honour approached the sentencing exercise in accordance with Way, I am not persuaded that his Honour has otherwise imposed a sentence which was other than appropriate in all the circumstances.
Ground 6:  The sentencing judge erred in rejecting special circumstances.
237Before the sentencing judge, defence counsel submitted that special circumstances should be found on the basis that this was the applicant's first significant period of custody and because she had mental health and alcohol abuse issues. He did not suggest that the applicant's background and her remorse could give rise to such a finding.
238The sentencing judge declined to find special circumstances and indicated that in his view the applicant would have ample time on parole for her to receive whatever assistance she might require when released from custody. It was submitted that this was an error because his Honour had impermissibly confined the matters of relevance to a finding of special circumstances.
239The applicant submitted that the special circumstances relating to the applicant included her background, her mental disabilities, her remorse and the fact that she would be in custody for the first time.
240I am not persuaded that his Honour has erred. Although there may be many circumstances which could inform a finding of special circumstances this Court will be slow to review the findings of a sentencing judge on this issue. Where, as in the present case, the foundation which is advanced for a finding of special circumstances in this Court was not advanced in the court below the likelihood of this Court intervening is remote: Aslett v R [2012] NSWCCA 235.
241Although the background of an applicant and any mental disability may inform a finding of special circumstances, issues of remorse would rarely inform a finding of special circumstances. Remorse may be reflected in the sentence which the court imposes but will rarely be a special circumstance. With respect to the submission that the first time in custody is a special circumstance, this issue has been recently considered on a number of occasions. In Collier v R [2012] NSWCCA 213, I said:
""It was submitted to this Court that the applicant, being almost 50 years of age and facing her first time in custody with good prospects of rehabilitation, should have been given the benefit of a finding of special circumstances. 
Inherent in this submission appears to be a misunderstanding of the role of special circumstances when sentencing. A finding of special circumstances is appropriate and relevant to a decision by a sentencing judge as to whether to depart from the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the overall sentence. The authorities are replete with findings by sentencing judges and by this Court of special circumstances. When an offender's history of offending or personal circumstances indicate that he or she would benefit from an extended period of supervision within the community a finding of special circumstances may be appropriate. For my part, as I said in R v Clark [2009] NSWCCA 49 at [12], I have considerable reservations about whether the fact that a person will be in custody for the first time is capable of constituting special circumstances: see also R v Kama [2000] NSWCCA 23; (2000) 110 A Crim 47 at [10]. The fact that a person has no previous criminal record and, accordingly, has not previously been incarcerated is a matter relevant to the total sentence and non-parole period. However, it is unlikely to be a circumstance warranting further leniency to an offender by a reduction in the term of the non-parole period: R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [18] (Spigelman CJ). Many persons who are sentenced will receive a sentence of imprisonment for the first time. That fact alone is unlikely to justify a finding that the offender's circumstances are special.""
242Whether or not to make a finding of special circumstances was entirely the province of the sentencing judge. Where as in this case a lengthy period on parole is inevitable, a finding that special circumstances could justify a reduction in the non-parole period is unlikely. His Honour did not err by rejecting a finding of special circumstances.
Ground 1:  The sentence was unduly harsh and severe
243As I understand this ground it is more appropriately expressed as a submission that the sentence was manifestly excessive. The capacity for this Court to respond to such a submission is limited. It is not sufficient that this Court may be of the view it would itself have imposed a different sentence. Intervention is only warranted if error can be demonstrated.
244I have previously discussed the circumstances of the offence and the personal circumstances of the applicant. The taking of a young person's life by deliberately running him down with a motor vehicle which the applicant was driving whilst significantly intoxicated and under the influence of drugs required a significant sentence. Having regard to the fact that the Parliament has provided that the offence of murder caries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment the sentence which his Honour imposed was entirely within the range available to him. I am not persuaded that there is any error in the manner in which his Honour approached the sentence or that the sentence was relevantly excessive.
245Although I would grant leave to appeal against sentence I would dismiss the appeal.
Orders
1. Refuse leave to appeal the conviction except for Ground 6.2. Grant leave to raise Ground 6 of the appeal but dismiss that ground.3. Grant leave to appeal against sentence and dismiss that appeal.
246LATHAM J:  I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.
247ADAMSON J:  I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.

		01 March 2013",2013-02-28 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2707110,AH v R [2013] NSWCCA 32,"JUDGMENT

1THE COURT: On 13 December 2011, following a plea of guilty to a charge of manslaughter, the applicant was sentenced by Johnson J to a total term of imprisonment of 4 years, comprising a non-parole period of 2 years with an additional term of 2 years. 

2His Honour ordered that in accordance with s 19 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, the whole of the term of the imprisonment of the applicant was to be served as a juvenile offender.

3The applicant has sought leave to appeal against that sentence on a number of grounds more fully set out below.

THE FACTS
4A document headed ""Agreed facts on sentence"" which was signed by the Crown, counsel for the applicant, and the applicant himself, was tendered before the sentencing judge. The sentencing judge summarised the facts in a manner than cannot be subject to criticism. The following summary is taken from the agreed facts: 

The charge
5The applicant was originally charged with the murder of David Wayne Boyce at Busby on 25 April 2009. Two other persons, Saad Jamie Barghachoun (""Barghachoun"") and JS were also each charged with the murder.

6All three persons were committed for trial for murder. The Crown subsequently accepted pleas of guilty to manslaughter by the applicant, as well as from Barghachoun. JS was found guilty of manslaughter following a trial.

Relevant events at Wentworthville and Busby
7On the evening of Friday 24 April 2009, David Wayne Boyce (""the deceased"") was one of a number of people at a gathering at Wentworthville. Some of those present were drinking alcohol, some were consuming methylamphetamine. Both substances were detected in the deceased's blood stream at a post mortem examination.

8At the same time, there was a gathering of people at an address in Busby (""the Busby premises"") at which JT resided with his parents. JT was drinking and socialising with a number of persons, and was heavily intoxicated as a result. One of the visitors to the Busby premises was RM, a 17-year-old girl who was the friend of another girl (DF) and the girlfriend of JP, who was also at the Busby premises at the time.

The first conversation between the applicant and JT
9At around 12:30am on Saturday 25 April 2009 there was a telephone conversation between RM and DF. During that call, JT asked RM whether or not she was speaking with the applicant. There had been ill feeling between JT and the applicant over their respective relationships with a female, CH. 

10The applicant and JT subsequently spoke to each other and their conversation ended in an argument. 

The applicant's first visit to the Busby premises
11At the time of his conversation with JT, the applicant was in the company of the co-accused JS. DF and her friend NR, were with them.

12After the applicant's conversation with JT ended, JS drove that group (i.e. the applicant, DF and NR) to the applicant's home. The applicant got out of the car for a short time and went into the house. He returned in possession of some metal poles which he placed on the floor of the car. 

13The applicant then travelled to the Busby premises with JS, DF and NR. It is to be noted that the co-accused Barghachoun was not with the applicant and JS at this time. 

14A short time later RM received a call from the applicant who said he was outside the premises, and that he wanted JT to come out and meet him. Although DF and NR had travelled to the area with the applicant, they had chosen to wait away from the premises. 

15JT came out of the Busby premises. He and the applicant argued for a short time, until JT's father came out and intervened. The applicant refused to leave unless and until JT apologised. JT's father apologised on JT's behalf and shook hands with the applicant. The applicant and JS then left the Busby premises and, having returned to their car with DF and NR, they drove away.

16After the applicant left, JP questioned JT as to why he (JT) had allowed his father to intervene and apologise for him. JT became angry at his father for sending the applicant and JS away. JT attempted to contact the applicant so that the applicant would return, but he was not able to do so. 

The second conversation between the applicant and JT
17RM (who was still at the Busby premises after the applicant had left) called her friend DF in the presence of JT. JT took the phone from RM and said to DF:

""Get (the applicant) on the phone.""

18The applicant and JT then had a further conversation in which they agreed to meet again so that they could fight ""one on one"". After that call JT, who was a friend of the deceased, called the deceased and asked him to come to the Busby premises. The deceased agreed to do so. 

The applicant's preparation for his return to the Busby premises
19After speaking with JT, the applicant, along with JS, DF and NR travelled to the premises of another person, AT. Barghachoun had been socialising with AT and another person, LA, earlier that evening. AT received a phone call, either from the applicant or JS, asking him, and the people with him (ie, LA and Barghachoun), to meet the applicant and the others at AT's home. 

20Meanwhile DP, who was the cousin of AT, along with DB and JH arrived at AT's premises in a separate car. 

The applicant's second visit to the Busby premises
21AT (as the driver of a van) along with the applicant, Barghachoun, DF, JS, AH, DP, LA, DB and NR, then left AT's premises and travelled to the Busby premises. On the way they collected JH (who was the brother of AH). 

22A number of metal poles were inside the van. There was discussion on the way between some of the males to the effect that they were going to the Busby premises for the purposes of having a fight. Several people heard the applicant say that he was going to have ""one on one"" fight with JT. JS came into possession of a knife, either prior to arriving at the Busby premises, or at that location. The applicant was not aware at any time that JS had a knife. 

23Upon arriving in the vicinity of the Busby premises, AT stopped the van around the corner and remained there. All of the others who had travelled there got out of the van and started walking towards the Busby premises. A number of them, including the applicant, were armed with metal poles. The applicant, along with DF, NR, JS, Barghachoun and others approached the Busby premises. As they did so, JT and JP were on the verandah. When JT and JP saw the group approaching they retreated inside. 

24The applicant, who was armed with a pole, banged on the screen door of the Busby premises yelling for JT to come out. He then turned away from the front door. As he did so, JT opened the door and approached the applicant from behind, striking him once to the back of the head with a wooden bat. This caused the applicant to fall to the ground. JT then retreated into the house.

25At about the same time the deceased arrived at the premises in a four-wheel drive vehicle. Before the driver of that vehicle had stopped (directly in front of the house), the deceased, who had been in the front passenger seat, jumped out with a baseball bat in his hand and approached several of the people who had arrived in the van with the applicant. Three other males and two females had accompanied the deceased to the Busby premises.

26Shortly after the deceased got out of the vehicle, he became involved in the affray with those who had arrived with the applicant. The deceased was stabbed once to the chest by JS, and died as a result. 

The applicant's departure from the Busby premises
27As they were leaving the area, JS smashed the front window of the Busby premises. He then used a pole to strike and damage a vehicle parked in the driveway of the house. He, along with Barghachoun and the applicant, as well as other persons who had arrived in the van, then left the area and returned to the van, following which it was driven away by AT who had been waiting. As the vehicle was driving away, males from inside the van said:

""We showed them"".

28The applicant said:

""We wasted our time, (JT) didn't even come out.""

29Barghachoun said:

""Which one was JT? Everyone was hitting everyone. I was hitting people ...""

30JS, who was heard by others in the van to acknowledge the fact that he had stabbed the deceased, was seen in the van in possession of a knife and was heard to remark that it ""had blood on it"". He passed the knife to someone who wiped it clean with a tissue. When the van eventually arrived back at AT's house, AT was handed the knife by JS. AT secreted the knife in a drain near his house and was later dealt with in the Local Court for the role that he played in disposing of it. 

31Following their arrival back at AT's premises, DF, NR, the applicant and JS drove to an industrial area, before proceeding to JS's house where the applicant fell asleep. DF was then informed that somebody had been stabbed at the Busby premises. She passed on this information to the applicant, who in turn passed it on to JS.

32At that point JS began to create a false alibi and said:

""We weren't there, we were at home watching movies. If you have to give a statement use that as an alibi"".

33DF said:

""Yeah, let's stick with that story"".

34Later in the morning JS drove NR home. DF was also in the car and when they arrived at NR's home DF said:

""Don't say anything"".

The applicant's arrest
35On the evening of 25 April 2009 police attended the applicant's home address, where he and JS were arrested. 

36During the search of the applicant's house, police also spoke with Barghachoun, who asked officers why JS had been arrested. Police told Barghachoun that JS had been arrested because of his involvement in a murder at Busby on the previous evening. When police asked Barghachoun whether he knew anything about it, he replied:

""That's the first I've heard about it...I went out with my mate Luca for a while and then he dropped me off at my place...around midnight"".

37When police arrived at the applicant's premises they were in possession of a search warrant which they proceeded to execute. One of the detectives spoke to the applicant and his mother about the warrant. As his mother was reading the occupier's notice the applicant said:

""Fuck em, there a bunch of dogs. They don't call em pigs for no reason"".

38As officers explained the warrant to the applicant's mother, the applicant received a call on his mobile phone at which time he was heard to say:

""I just had fucken 8 coppers fucken barging the door. ... Fuck em - says I can't obstruct the search warrant, doesn't say I can't call em pigs and fucken dogs"".


39When the applicant read out aloud the items of interest listed on the search warrant he said to the person on the phone:

""They're looking for this to do with the murder this morning. I fucken been asleep. I fucken woke up now ..."".

40When police commenced to search the applicant's bedroom, the applicant said to them:

""Youse are a bunch of fucken retards ... So who was I supposed to have murdered anyway? ... Give me my fucken stuff back - what the fuck do you think this is?""

41When his mother tried to calm him down, the applicant said:

""I don't care - fuck yous"".

42After further exchanges, and as a consequence of the applicant's ongoing interference with the execution of the search warrant by the police, the applicant was charged with an offence of hindering the execution of a search warrant pursuant to s 52 of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002. 

43That charge was contained in a Form 1 which was tendered before the sentencing judge.

THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL
Ground 1 - His Honour erred in failing to properly identify the nature of the applicant's liability for the offence of manslaughter.
The sentence proceedings
44In considering this ground, it is necessary to make reference to some aspects of the sentencing proceedings.

45At the outset of the proceedings, his Honour enquired as to the basis on which the plea to the charge of manslaughter had been entered. The following exchange ensued between his Honour, counsel for the Crown and counsel for the applicant (at AB 89 - 90):

""His Honour And the basis upon which the plea to manslaughter was entered is what, if counsel could tell me what the agreed basis is?
Crown Unlawful and dangerous act.

His Honour But by application of joint criminal enterprise or extended joint criminal enterprise? Let's get it clear at the outset.
Crown On the basis, the Crown says, of a joint criminal enterprise

His Honour Is that agreed?
Applicant Extended joint criminal enterprise, your Honour.

His Honour Extended joint criminal enterprise, or joint criminal enterprise?
Crown The Crown agrees its extended your Honour"".


46Following this exchange, the hearing proceeded. The applicant was not called to give evidence. The only oral evidence called in the applicant's case was from a Juvenile Justice officer who was the joint author of a report which was before his Honour for the purposes of sentence. In addition to that report, counsel for the applicant tendered:

(i) a report of Dr Christopher J Lennings, Psychologist;
(ii) a testimonial from the applicant's employer;
(iii) a report from the Westside Youth Centre, with whom the applicant had undertaken voluntary work; and
(iv) two reports dealing with the medical condition of the applicant's mother.

47In the course of submissions to his Honour, senior counsel for the applicant said (at AB 112):

""Now, the plea is entered on the basis that he was engaged in an unlawful and dangerous act by anticipating the possibility of injury to the other group, but his involvement in the actual death is minimal, apart from that constructive case against him if I can say that"".

48Subsequently, the following exchange occurred between his Honour and senior counsel (at AB 116 - 117):

His Honour Did he instigate an affray?
Counsel Well, I mean, again, one of the problems with this is the fact that that's one of those inter venus (sic) type arguments; did he instigate an affray? He participated for a very short time in an affray, to which he pleaded guilty, I might say, at a very early opportunity. 

His Honour That's been dropped.
Counsel Yes, but nevertheless, it's an indication of taking responsibility for that part of the participation. He's in the affray, clearly, when he's outside the front door, and that would put any person in fear, so we don't have any difficulty with that. And, essentially, that acknowledgement of a factual circumstance brought him very close to manslaughter anyway, because it's an acknowledgement of participation in an unlawful act, so perhaps I'm jumping about here, but in terms of the plea, of course, that has some relevance"".

49The Crown's final submissions to his Honour included the following (at AB 126): 

""Now the question in this case, of course, is that if the court comes to the view that AH did have some insight into the fact that someone could be seriously injured that would make it more serious, and that if he had been an instigator of events which led to the affray, or that which lead to the situation with (sic) somebody was not just seriously injured but was in fact killed, his culpability would be greater still"".


50What was said at that point was consistent with the Crown's written submissions to his Honour which included the following: 

""The offender's liability for manslaughter arises from an extended joint criminal enterprise. ... The present charge arose out of a serious breach of the peace, namely an affray, between two rival groups of young men"".

His Honour's reasons
51Relevantly in terms of this ground of appeal, his Honour said the following in the course of his reasons (at [70]): 

""The offender has pleaded guilty to the crime of manslaughter. He is to be sentenced for his participation in an extended joint criminal enterprise, in that he took part in an unlawful and dangerous act, an affray, in circumstances which objectively carried with it an appreciable risk of serous injury being occasioned to a person"".

The submissions of the applicant
52It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that in making those observations in paragraph [70] of his reasons, his Honour had ""misconceived the nature of the plea"" and in doing so had confused the concept of a joint criminal enterprise with an extended joint criminal enterprise. Counsel submitted, in particular, that the contents of paragraph [70] of his Honour's reasons reflected an analysis of a joint criminal enterprise to commit manslaughter, rather than an extended joint criminal enterprise. 

53Central to the complaint made on behalf of the applicant was the following submission which was included in the written submissions filed by counsel (at paras. 35 - 36):
""The proceedings on sentence made it clear that the plea was entered on the basis that the offender's (sic) participated in an offence, namely a joint enterprise, to facilitate an assault on JT (""one on one""). The facts did not suggest that the offender's state of mind intended to inflict serious bodily injury on anyone - however it was accepted that he contemplated the use of the metal poles if the situation got out of hand, if they were attacked - it was conceded that the use of the poles in a fight would inevitably entail serious bodily injury.

There was accordingly a significant distinction in the way his Honour characterised the offence in the Reasons for Sentence and the specific nature of the plea agreed by both sides"".

Consideration and conclusion
54For a number of reasons, we do not accept the submissions advanced on behalf of the applicant.

55Although the terms of the agreement at sentence between the Crown and the applicant lacked precision, it is apparent that what was agreed upon were the facts. The agreement did not, on a fair reading of the transcript of the sentence proceedings, extend to an agreement which limited the nature of the applicant's participation in the offending. In particular, it is apparent that the agreement as to the facts did not extend to an agreement that the applicant had intended to engage in a ""one on one assault"" upon JT, or that his participation in the extended joint criminal enterprise was so limited. That may well have been the applicant's position on sentence. However, it is evident from the submissions made to his Honour that it was not a position with which the Crown agreed. 

56It was the Crown's position on sentence that the conduct of the applicant amounted to participation in an affray and that, in so participating, he had contemplated the possibility of serious bodily injury being inflicted upon some person. So much is clear from the terms of the Crown's submissions to his Honour, both orally and in writing. This is also the basis, properly understood, of the submissions below on behalf of the applicant. 

57The fact that this was the Crown's position is also clear from his Honour's enquiry, to senior counsel for the applicant, concerning whether or not the applicant had in fact participated in an affray. It is to be inferred that the reason his Honour asked that question was because it was relevant to an issue in the proceedings which he was required to determine, namely the nature of the applicant's participation in the extended joint criminal enterprise. In responding, senior counsel for the applicant expressly acknowledged the applicant's participation in an affray.

58In our view, it is clear that despite the agreement as to the facts, there remained an issue as to the applicant's participation. As with all other factual issues on sentence that was an issue which was for his Honour to determine. 

59We do not accept that his Honour misconceived the nature of the plea in any way, nor do we accept that he confused the concepts of joint criminal enterprise and extended joint criminal enterprise. In this regard, quite apart from the terms of paragraph [70], his Honour also said (at paragraph [83]):

""I keep in mind that I am not sentencing the Offender for directly causing the death of Mr Boyce, nor am I sentencing him for his participation in a joint enterprise that had as its object the doing of an act of killing or inflicting grievous bodily harm"" (emphasis added).

60It seems that part of the applicant's complaint before this Court is the description by his Honour of the affray as ""an unlawful and dangerous act (see [51] infra). The affray was unlawful, and it was dangerous. It was not ""the unlawful and dangerous act"" that caused death. His Honour did not describe it as such. Nor did his Honour treat it as such. If his Honour were to have treated the affray in that manner, then his Honour would not have made the comments at paragraph [83] of his reasons recited above. Those passages of his Honour's reasons, far from exhibiting any confusion, reflect a clear understanding of the fact that the applicant was not to be sentenced on the basis of participation in a joint criminal enterprise, but rather on the basis of an extended joint criminal enterprise. What constituted that participation was a matter for his Honour to determine. 

61Further, in our view his Honour did not err in concluding that the applicant had participated in the extended joint criminal enterprise in the manner alleged by the Crown. Quite apart from the express concession made by senior counsel who appeared for the applicant that the applicant had participated in an affray, the facts established that in circumstances where there had been tension between the applicant and JT, and following a visit by the applicant to the Busby premises, the applicant recruited a number of other persons and travelled back there. The applicant himself was armed with a metal pole, as were several of the other persons who were with him. 

62The agreed facts also established that upon arrival, the applicant approached the Busby premises in the company of a number of other males. The applicant banged on the screen door at the front of the Busby premises, only to be struck from behind as he turned away from the door. It was at about the same time that the deceased arrived at the premises and jumped out of a vehicle armed with a baseball bat, approaching several of the people who had accompanied the applicant to the premises. It was also at this time, according to the agreed facts, that the deceased ""became involved in the affray with the white van group"" and was killed. 

63In our view, these facts supported his Honour's conclusion as to the applicant's participation. 
64For these reasons, this ground is not made out.

65It should be noted that in the course of the hearing of the appeal, and although it was not set out in any of the grounds, counsel for the applicant made a submission that because of the matters raised in support of ground 1, his Honour's conclusion as to the applicant's participation in the offending amounted to a denial of procedural fairness. For the reasons we have set out, we reject that submission.

66It was made clear at the hearing of the appeal that the five grounds advanced by the applicant were interrelated, and that grounds 2 to 5 depended, to a large extent, upon ground 1 being upheld. Although we have found that ground 1 has not been made out, it is appropriate that we deal with the remaining four grounds, to the extent that they raise issues which are independent of those raised in ground 1. 

Ground 2 - His Honour erred in the assessment of the objective gravity of the applicant's offence 
His Honour's reasons
67At paragraphs [90] - [92] of his reasons, his Honour said the following:

""I am satisfied that the offender's crime is one of considerable seriousness. He was responsible for setting in train the conflict which led to two groups of young men clashing outside the Busby house. There was an element of planning and organisation with the provision of assistance by his companions to accompany him to the fight.

The offender had an opportunity to walk away from the dispute after the intervention of JT's stepfather, but he chose to resume the dispute and return to the Busby house. The offender emerged from the van, armed with a metal pole, indicating his willingness to use force, and sought to confront JT for that purpose. Although he did not, in the end, strike a blow to any person, it might be concluded that the only reason that he did not do so was because JT got in first, striking him to the head.

It was accepted in submissions for the Crown and the offender that the offender was not intoxicated at all by alcohol or any drugs on this night. The fact that he engaged in conduct of this type while sober is a further troubling feature of the case"".

The submissions of the applicant
68The submissions of the applicant in support of this ground were, in essence, that:

(i) his Honour's reference to the applicant being responsible for ""setting in train the conflict"" was an inaccurate and oversimplified label for the role of the offender;

(ii) his Honour's conclusion that the offender ""chose to resume the dispute"" was also inaccurate, and that it was in fact JT who did so;

(iii) JT provoked and goaded the applicant to return to the Busby premises; and 

(iv) in concluding that there was an element of planning and organisation on the part of the applicant, his Honour had overstated the facts.

Consideration and conclusion
69We do not accept the submissions advanced in support of this ground.

70As to the first submission, the agreed facts established that the applicant had visited the Busby premises and had left only after JT's father had intervened to quell the dispute which had arisen. Thereafter the applicant, following a telephone conversation with JT, gathered together a large number of people before returning. When he and the others returned to the Busby premises, the deceased was killed. Viewed in this way, his Honour's conclusion that the applicant was responsible for setting in train the conflict was, in our view, neither inaccurate nor oversimplified. The conflict to which his Honour was referring was the affray. 

71As to the second submission, the agreed facts established that although JT had initiated the telephone conversation with the applicant following the applicant's first attendance at the Busby premises, it was the applicant who gathered others and returned. In that sense, it was the applicant who chose to resume the dispute. While the significance of this conduct to the sentence to be imposed must be assessed bearing in mind the issues of immaturity to which his Honour referred, it is an accurate statement of fact.

72As to the third submission, we do not accept that JT, by initiating the conversation with the applicant referred to in [70] above, provoked or goaded the applicant. The facts record that the applicant and JT agreed to meet again. The applicant could have walked away but chose not to do so. 

73The fourth submission was advanced on the basis that the killing of the deceased was an unintended consequence of the fact that one of the people who accompanied the applicant carried a knife. We accept that such a consequence might well have been unintended. However, the agreed facts established that the offender did indeed plan and organise the second visit to the Busby premises as we have outlined, as a consequence of which the deceased was killed. In concluding, correctly, that the applicant had played an organisational role, his Honour did not overstate the facts. He recorded them accurately. 

74We accept that the applicant took no part in the act which caused the deceased's death. We also accept that his involvement in the events at the Busby premises on the second occasion was short. The shortness of his involvement and actual participation were also unintended. However what took place prior to the applicant's arrival at the Busby premises on that second occasion cannot be overlooked. To do so would result in a gross distortion of the totality of the applicant's offending. Relevantly, prior to going to the Busby premises on the second occasion, the applicant had: 

(i) spoken with JT over the telephone;

(ii) gone home and retrieved a quantity of metal poles;

(iii) gone with JS to the Busby premises;

(iv) avoided a confrontation with JT only through the intervention of JT's father; 

(v) spoken with JT again;

(vi) made a decision, following that conversation, to return to the Busby premises; and

(vii) recruited a large number of persons to accompany him, some of whom (like the applicant) were armed. 

75The characterisation of the objective seriousness of an offence is part of the role of a sentencing judge, with which this Court will be slow to interfere. The question is whether or not the particular characterisation of the sentencing judge was open (see Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 per Spigelman CJ at [37] and Simpson J at [46]). In our view, his Honour's conclusions were clearly open in the present case.

76Having regard to all of these factors, we do not accept that the applicant's offending should be properly regarded as falling at, or even towards, the bottom end of the range as was submitted on his behalf. To reach such a view would ignore the organisational role which his Honour correctly found that the applicant had played. 

77For these reasons, this ground is not made out.

Ground 3 - His Honour erred in giving too much weight to general deterrence and denunciation having regard to the offender's role in the offence, and his youth
His Honour's reasons
78We have already referred to the applicant's organisational role in the offending. In terms of his age, his Honour made specific reference (at paragraph [94] of his reasons) to the fact that the applicant was 16 years and 8 months old at the time of the offending. He then said (at paragraph [112]): 

""In sentencing an offender who commits a crime at the age of 18 years and 6 months, principles of retribution and general deterrence may be of less significance than when sentencing an adult offender for the same offence. Recognition is to be given to the capacity of young persons to reform and mould their character to confirm (sic) to society's norms, with considerable emphasis to be placed on the need to provide an opportunity for rehabilitation. In considering the role of retribution on sentence, the Court will have regard to emotional immaturity or a young person's less-than-fully developed capacity to control impulsive behaviour: BP v R [2010] NSWCCA 159; 201 A Crim R 379"".

With respect to his Honour this is a correct statement of principle, and of the approach to be taken.

The submissions of the applicant
79The submissions advanced on behalf of the applicant in respect of this ground were based, in large measure, upon the proposition that his Honour had erred in his assessment of the objective gravity of the applicant's offending. We have concluded that this proposition has not been made out. 

Consideration and conclusion 
80His Honour was obviously aware of the applicant's age, having made two specific references to it. His Honour was also conscious of the relevance of the applicant's age. So much is evident from paragraph [112] of his Honour's reasons, in which his Honour correctly set out the principles which governed the manner in which the applicant's age was to be taken into account on sentence.

81The weight which is to be given to the fact of the youth of an offender will necessarily vary according to the seriousness of the offence. Considerations of general deterrence and retribution cannot be completely ignored when sentencing young offenders. This is because there is significant public interest in deterring antisocial conduct of the kind in which the present applicant engaged. It follows that general deterrence and denunciation remained relevant considerations in the sentencing of the applicant. 

82Further, as a principle, the emphasis which might be given, when sentencing a young offender, to rehabilitation rather than general deterrence and retribution, may be moderated when the young person has conducted himself in a way in which an adult might, and in doing so has committed a crime of violence (see generally KT v R [2008] NSWCCA 51; (2008) 182 A Crim R 571 per McClellan CJ at CL at [22] - [26] and the authorities cited therein). 

83Taking into account all of these matters, this ground is not made out. 

Ground 4 - His Honour erred in the sentence imposed on the offender in comparison to his co-offenders based on the principle of parity
The applicant's submissions
84It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that in view of principles of parity, the applicant should have received a sentence considerably less than that which was imposed. This submission was based upon the following propositions: 

(i) the applicant was considerably younger than both of the co-offenders;
(ii) his actions were far less culpable than both;
(iii) his subjective features were at least the equivalent of Barghachoun, if not more compelling; and 
(iv) he had been provoked.

Consideration and conclusion
85His Honour sentenced the co-offender Barghachoun to an identical term of imprisonment as that imposed on the offender, with a non parole period which was 3 months longer. Barghachoun was sentenced as an adult and, like the offender, was given the benefit of a discount of 20% on account of his plea of guilty.

86JS, who stabbed the deceased, was sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 6 years, with a non-parole period of 3 years. This incorporated a discount of 20% to reflect the plea of guilty to the offence of manslaughter which he had offered to the Crown, but which had been rejected.

87The applicant's youth was, as we have outlined, a matter of which his Honour was conscious, and which he took into account on sentence. We have already concluded that the applicant was not provoked. 

88In our view, the remaining matters advanced on the applicant's behalf do not support a conclusion that the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance when his sentence is compared with the sentences imposed upon his co-offenders.

89We accept that the applicant's actions were less culpable than those of JS, whose act of stabbing caused the death of the deceased. That difference in culpability is properly reflected in the different sentences which were imposed upon the applicant on the one hand, and JS on the other.

90We do not, however, accept that the applicant's actions were far less culpable than those of Barghachoun. It is evident that Barghachoun was sentenced on the basis that, like the applicant, he was not directly involved in the act causing the death of the deceased (see R v Barghachoun [2011] NSWSC 1534 at [64]). Barghachoun was one of the participants whose attendance was organised by the applicant. His Honour found (Barghachoun (supra) at [73]) that Barghachoun had willingly participated in the events, armed himself with a metal pole, and struck a member of the other group with a baseball bat. Importantly, and unlike the applicant, Barghachoun played no organisational role and was not a party to the first visit by the applicant to the Busby premises.

91Taking all relevant matters into account, and having particular regard to what we have concluded were the entirety of the circumstances of the applicant's offending and the organisational role that he played, we do not consider that there is any disparity in the sentence imposed upon the applicant when compared with those imposed upon the co-accused.

92It follows that this ground is not made out.

Ground 5 - In all the circumstances the sentence was manifestly excessive
93Reliance was placed on the submissions advanced in respect of grounds (1) to (4) in support of this ground. For the reasons set out, those grounds have not been made out. 

94In our view, his Honour did not err in his assessment of the applicant's offending, nor did he err in concluding that the applicant's actions constituted the commission of what he described as an ""objectively serious crime"". His Honour had regard to the applicant's subjective circumstances, including his youth, and made specific reference to the medical report which was tendered on the applicant's behalf, and which referred to his immaturity. His Honour concluded, correctly in our view, that a sentence of full time custody was the only appropriate sentence in all of the circumstances. 

95The offending in which the applicant engaged was a form of street violence. The applicant was the organiser of the attendance of a large number of armed persons at the Busby premises. The attendance of those persons culminated in one of the participants taking the life of the deceased. By his plea, the applicant acknowledged that in acting as he did, he contemplated that serious bodily injury might be inflicted upon some person. Despite the applicant's age, considerations of general deterrence, and the need to protect the public from such activity, remained relevant considerations on sentence.

96Viewed in this way, the sentence imposed by his Honour was not manifestly excessive and this ground is not made out.

ORDERS
97For the reasons set out above, the orders of the court are as follows: 

(i) leave to appeal granted;
(ii) appeal dismissed.

		26 February 2013",2013-02-20 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2707135,Ziha v R [2013] NSWCCA 27,"Judgment

1MACFARLAN JA: After a trial in the Supreme Court in February 2008 before a judge and jury, the appellant was convicted of murdering Mr Barry Corbett on 1 August 2006 (contrary to s 18(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900), and of maliciously wounding Mrs Marija Ziha, his wife, on the same date (contrary to s 35(1)(a) of the Crimes Act). The appellant had pleaded not guilty to the murder of Mr Corbett but guilty of his manslaughter. He was represented at the trial by counsel and conducted a defence to the murder charge of ""substantial impairment by abnormality of mind"" (s 23A of the Crimes Act). He had pleaded not guilty to the charge of malicious wounding of his wife, stating that it ""was accidental, and there was no intention or malice"".

2The appellant was unrepresented on his appeal against his convictions. In support of the appeal he lodged closely-typed written submissions exceeding 100 pages in length and addressed the Court orally. Whilst some aspects of his submissions do not have sufficient merit to warrant discussion in this judgment, all have been considered. 

3The appeal is out of time but I would grant the appellant leave to appeal as he has given some explanation for his delay and has raised some points that warrant consideration. He professes not to be seeking to appeal against his sentences but some of his submissions raise issues concerning the sentences and I have taken the view that it is appropriate to deal with them on their merits.

4Before dealing with the appellant's grounds of appeal, it is necessary to refer briefly to the factual circumstances giving rise to his convictions. Those to which I refer under the next heading were not in dispute at the trial.

FACTUAL CIRCUMSTANCES

5The appellant and Mrs Corbett (the name by which Mrs Ziha came to be known) were born in Yugoslavia. They married there in 1975. After having two children, they migrated to Australia in 1989. By 2005 their relationship had been strained for a number of years.

6In December 2005, the appellant attempted to commit suicide and, after Christmas that year, Mrs Corbett, following a number of prior threats to do so, moved out of the family home at Baulkham Hills. She moved to a flat in Parramatta but visited the family home from time to time to maintain contact with her children. At or prior to this time Mrs Corbett commenced a relationship with Mr Corbett, which continued until his death. The appellant did not meet Mr Corbett but knew and disapproved of the relationship. At some stage he secretly copied a set of keys that his son had to the Parramatta flat where Mrs Corbett lived. He used the keys to visit the flat uninvited, whilst Mrs Corbett was away. In the main bedroom he noticed a Cosmopolitan magazine and disapproved of its contents, regarding it as pornographic. 

7On 1 August 2006, the eve of the appellant and Mrs Corbett's wedding anniversary, Mr Corbett visited Mrs Corbett at the Parramatta flat. They went to bed early, turning the lights off by 9.30 pm. During the evening, the appellant left his Baulkham Hills home, telling his children that he was going to buy petrol and dog food. After buying petrol, he drove to the Parramatta flat where he observed that Mrs Corbett's car was parked in the street whilst Mr Corbett's was parked in Mrs Corbett's designated parking spot.

8Seeing that the flat was in darkness, he returned to his car and took out a kitchen knife, gloves, a torch and the keys to the flat. Putting on the gloves, he entered the front door of the building using the keys, turned on the torch and ultimately entered the main bedroom of the flat.

9On his entry, Mr Corbett awoke. The appellant attacked him with the knife, inflicting more than 30 injuries, resulting in Mr Corbett's death. Mrs Corbett awoke during the attack and tried to push the appellant away and, in the course of doing so, received a knife wound to the thigh. She ran out of the building to summon help. The appellant cut off Mr Corbett's penis and placed it in the bedside drawer on top of the Cosmopolitan magazine. Leaving the house, he drove to the Parramatta River and threw the knife and keys into it. Returning home, he washed his clothes and waited for the police. He was arrested early on 2 August 2006.

RELEVANT STATUTORY PROVISIONS

10Although the issue of provocation was not raised at the trial, it is relevant to the appeal as the appellant contends that the trial judge should have left it to the jury for its consideration.

11Sections 23 and 23A of the Crimes Act, dealing with provocation and the defence of ""substantial impairment by abnormality of mind"", are relevantly in the following terms:

""23 Trial for murder-provocation

(1) Where, on the trial of a person for murder, it appears that the act or omission causing death was an act done or omitted under provocation and, but for this subsection and the provocation, the jury would have found the accused guilty of murder, the jury shall acquit the accused of murder and find the accused guilty of manslaughter.

(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), an act or omission causing death is an act done or omitted under provocation where:

(a) the act or omission is the result of a loss of self-control on the part of the accused that was induced by any conduct of the deceased (including grossly insulting words or gestures) towards or affecting the accused, and

(b) that conduct of the deceased was such as could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost self-control as to have formed an intent to kill, or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon, the deceased,

whether that conduct of the deceased occurred immediately before the act or omission causing death or at any previous time.

(3) For the purpose of determining whether an act or omission causing death was an act done or omitted under provocation as provided by subsection (2), there is no rule of law that provocation is negatived if:

(a) there was not a reasonable proportion between the act or omission causing death and the conduct of the deceased that induced the act or omission,

(b) the act or omission causing death was not an act done or omitted suddenly, or

(c) the act or omission causing death was an act done or omitted with any intent to take life or inflict grievous bodily harm.

(4) Where, on the trial of a person for murder, there is any evidence that the act causing death was an act done or omitted under provocation as provided by subsection (2), the onus is on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the act or omission causing death was not an act done or omitted under provocation.

(5) This section does not exclude or limit any defence to a charge of murder.

23A Substantial impairment by abnormality of mind

(1) A person who would otherwise be guilty of murder is not to be convicted of murder if:

(a) at the time of the acts or omissions causing the death concerned, the person's capacity to understand events, or to judge whether the person's actions were right or wrong, or to control himself or herself, was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition, and

(b) the impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter.

(2) For the purposes of subsection (1) (b), evidence of an opinion that an impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter is not admissible.

...

(4) The onus is on the person accused to prove that he or she is not liable to be convicted of murder by virtue of this section.

(5) A person who but for this section would be liable, whether as principal or accessory, to be convicted of murder is to be convicted of manslaughter instead.

...

(8) In this section:

underlying condition means a pre-existing mental or physiological condition, other than a condition of a transitory kind.""

THE CROWN CASE AT THE TRIAL

12Having referred above to various factual circumstances not in contention, it is necessary for the purposes of the appeal to refer only to the following limited aspects of the evidence called by the Crown.

Mrs Corbett's evidence

13Mrs Corbett described the appellant as a very angry man but identified only two occasions (in 1993 and 1995) since their arrival in Australia on which he had been physically violent. She said that he was obsessed with the origins of the Hungarian language and this was an all-consuming passion, leading him to reject social activities. She said that he was a loner, with only one friend. 

14She said that Mr Corbett was spoken of a number of times in conversations between herself and the appellant. In one, the appellant told her, ""I know what car your guy is driving ... and I can tell you the registration number"". On a couple of occasions when Mr Corbett was staying with Mrs Corbett at the Parramatta flat, the appellant sent Mrs Corbett SMS messages, one being to the effect: ""why are you doing this to me, do you hate me so much, I know somebody is with you"". 

15She said that in March 2006, the appellant told her: ""I have plans and many people will be sad, it was all your fault ..."". At Easter, he yelled at her: ""Oh you are such a hypocrite, you have desecrated Easter because you are ringing me from your lover's house ... you are such a sinner and you don't know yet what you've done, you will see"". On a number of occasions the appellant said to her: ""Oh, you are having hot sex right in front of my eyes"".

16She also said that on an occasion in March 2006, the appellant said to her: ""Oh, people are such hypocrites. You steal a loaf of bread and you go to gaol for it and you steal another man's wife and nothing happens to you"".

The appellant's son's evidence

17The appellant's son gave evidence that his father said to him that ""she is leaving me because he is rich"" and ""because he has a large dick"", and that his father said he had seen Mr Corbett's car parked in front of Mrs Corbett's flat. The son said that on one occasion he asked his father whether he was ""staking out"" his mother's flat, to which the appellant said that ""Yes, he has been seeing what they are doing"" and they are ""making hot sex in front of his very eyes"". On another occasion the appellant said to him that he planned to spend the rest of his life in gaol and that it was ""a good retirement plan"" for him. The son also said that, whilst at the beach one day, the appellant asked whether he knew where he could get a gun. 

THE APPELLANT'S ACCOUNTS OF EVENTS

First account given to Dr Bruce Westmore

18At the request of the appellant's lawyers, Dr Bruce Westmore, a forensic psychiatrist, interviewed the appellant on 4 April 2007. Dr Westmore was called to give evidence at the trial by the Crown.

19Dr Westmore's evidence of what the appellant said to him included the following:

""Q. You asked him what happened leading up to the incident and he responded by saying 'why did I kill him?'?
A. Yes.

Q. And you said 'yes'. And he then went on to say, 'I went to see the house of my wife, it is a dead-end street, I turned my car off, I noticed my wife's car was on the street and another car was in the driveway. I did recognise that car, a metallic yellow.' He continued, 'I wasn't surprised, because I knew that this was Maria's boyfriend's car. I saw that the lights were off. That puzzled me. I went to the back to check the sitting room. All the lights were off at 9.30.'

He then said in his history that he gave to you, 'that triggered me off, that is what I could not take'. You asked Mr Ziha what he did and he said to you, 'at that moment, I was flowed with emotions. I decided to do whatever I had to do'. He then told you, Dr Westmore, that he returned to his vehicle and, in his words, 'found what was necessary. I retrieved the knife from my bag which I normally go to work with'. He told you that he also took a glove and a torch from his car. He told you, 'I had a set of keys, that was also in my bag'. He then told you, Dr Westmore, 'I headed to the entrance. I said to myself, 'if I go forward there is no way back'. I couldn't stop it, I knew what I was doing, I was conscious of what I was doing. I just couldn't listen to myself. I wanted to take off the old man's tool'. Is that correct?
A. Yes.

Q. You asked him, Dr Westmore, was he referring to the deceased's penis, and the accused said 'yes'. You asked him to confirm that he had in fact done that, and the accused said 'yes I did that. That was the reason to enter the house'. Is that correct?
A. Yes, he said this was the reason.

Q. I beg your pardon, 'this was the reason to enter the house'. You asked him if he had been angry at the time and the accused told you, 'I just know I could not control myself. It is easy to call it anger. I cannot describe it. I just know I was uncontrollable and I was frightened'"" (Transcript p 280).

The appellant's second account to Dr Westmore

20After receiving a copy of a report of Dr Olav Nielssen, forensic psychiatrist, and other documents, Dr Westmore interviewed the appellant again on 15 January 2008. Dr Westmore's evidence of what the appellant told him at this interview included the following:

""Q. ... You asked Mr Ziha how his mood had been in the weeks leading up to the homicide. He said to you, 'I can tell you in months, really miserable. I was on the bottom ...'?
A. Yes.

...

Q. You actually asked what did he feel when he saw another car parked at his wife's house. He said 'initially, I wasn't really surprised, because I knew Marija had another boyfriend and I was tolerating that in the past'. You asked him what was different on this particular night, and he said, 'the light was off, and I knew it was not just a friendly visit, and that was the difference'. You asked him directly was he jealous, and he said, 'no, because I knew that connection, and I hoped I would overcome this'. He then went on to say that his mother-in-law had told him that Marija would come back to him, and he said 'that is what I deeply believed. And I wouldn't do this stupid thing, because I would lose Marija forever. Not even to meet the man or punch his nose because that would work against me. I tried to be diplomatic with Marija'. He said that to you?
A. Yes"" (Transcript pp 290, 291).

The appellant's evidence at trial

21The appellant's evidence concerning the evening of 1 August 2006 included the following:

""Q. What did you do then?
A. Then I parked my car in front of the building and I walked down the pathway just to check if I'm right or not, you know, is that Barry or not? So it was that; that was gold Mercedes, it was Barry's car.

Q, What did you do then?
A. Then I looked back to the - to the house and I - I saw there are no lights anywhere, not in the bedroom, not in the kitchen, so I said okay.

...

Q. What happened?
A. Then I thought that maybe they are watching TV so I'll go back onto the back of the building. So I checked that window, that was in darkness, but I was standing there for a while to see if I can see these flashes from the television, you know, from the TV set but they having no flashes so I concluded that they are not watching TV.

Q. How did you feel?
A. Oh, that I think I - I saw the building like it was built from a glass, not from bricks but from glass. I saw everything through the walls and I saw what my imagination dictated to see. I saw them together.

Q. Doing what?
A. Well, doing fun.

Q. How did you feel?
A. I was really upset with that, I was really upset and I thought that this is - this smacking my face, you know slapping my face, my face all the time.

Q. Had you ever felt that way before?
A. No, no, I was - I was - I lost my control then, you know. I really - I can't remember being in that mood ever ever before and not after.

Q. What did you do?
A. Then I walked back to the car and opened the passenger side door and then I grabbed the torch which was in the car, I grabbed the gloves I grabbed from the car and I grabbed my bag. I opened my bag, I strode [sic] out the contents. I picked up the keys, and I picked up the knife, it was the right one there, I picked up that knife.

...

Q. When you got the gloves and the knife and the torch what did you do?
A. I undone the lock of the entrance to the building first and then unlocked - undone the lock of the - Marija's flat and then I put my hands on to the handle and that was when I went, I really tried not to go any further, and I told myself you don't want to do that, if you go now in there's no way back, there is no return. I clearly remember I tried seriously not to enter there.

Q. How were you feeling?
A. How I did feel that - I feel empty. I was really empty at that time. I felt like - like I am not myself, that there are two people fighting over me and I tried to depict that one in the prison later on in the art classes. I tried to depict that emotion, how I felt that night"" (Transcript pp 291, 342, 343, 346, 347).

The appellant's recorded interview

22There is nothing in the record of the appellant's ERISP to which reference need be made.

THE PSYCHIATRIC EVIDENCE

23Ultimately, both Dr Westmore, who was called by the Crown, and Dr Nielssen, who was called by the appellant, agreed that the appellant suffered from depression which constituted ""an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition"" (see s 23A(1)(b)). Their views on the further question, relevant to s 23A(1)(a), of whether that abnormality of mind substantially impaired the appellant's capacity ""to judge whether [his] actions were right or wrong, or to control himself"" were to the following effect.

Dr Westmore's first assessment

24Dr Westmore referred to the view that he held after the first interview with the appellant as follows:

""Q. At the time you examined him he was depressed, and you believed that while it was likely he was suffering some depression at the time of the incident, his principal emotional drives were those of anger arising from jealousy. Whilst he did refer to losing control, you believe that that occurred again in the context of anger, his decision to kill the deceased was made some time before he entered the house and the genital mutilation is also consistent with his feelings of jealousy and rage. Is that correct?
A. That's correct"" (Transcript pp 287 - 8).

Dr Nielssen's opinion

25Dr Nielssen expressed the view that the appellant's relevant capacity was substantially impaired by his abnormality of mind.

Dr Westmore's further assessment

26Dr Westmore gave the following evidence concerning his 2008 interview of the appellant:

""Q. You asked him whether he had been seeing a general practitioner or psychiatrist at the time of the homicide and he told you that he had been in hospital in December 2005, and sent to a psychiatric ward, but he did not want to be there. Taking that history, did you develop any opinion based on what we have just gone through?
A. Well, the importance of that from my perspective was we have no objective medical assessment of his mental state or mood state during that period leading up to the incident. It is not uncommon for people not to want to see psychiatrists, or to take psychotropic medication. Putting that aside, but we have lost the objective assessment of his mood, the quality and severity of his depression during those two months, which make us more reliant on the history of other people, and his own history.

...

Q. Now when [the appellant] was discussing with you the issues that he raised with your April 2007 report, he went on to say 'there was no premeditation' he also told you that he wanted to plead guilty to manslaughter and he told you that he could not accept that he was willing. He then went on to say: 'I was willing for 30 seconds but then went away but it was too late'. Now, doctor did you explore that with the accused?
A. Not any further than that.

Q. What did you make of that?
A. If you note there is a significant difference between the two histories. If you give me the history that I got on the second occasion on the first occasion my conclusions about him might have been different. The first history is more consistent with an angry, jealous revengeful man. The second history is more consistent with a man who is hopelessly lost and depressed. You can see there is a different history there.

...

Q. Now based on your re-examination of him on 15 January 2008, you formed a view. Can you tell the court what that is?
A. Following the second assessment?

Q. Yes?
A. Yes. In summary the case is quite difficult from a psychiatric perspective. The man was, in my mind, no doubt depressed at the time this incident occurred and he had had a past history of depression. There is some history to indicate that he was probably significantly depressed leading up to the incident even though he had not seen doctors or psychiatrists. The two competing issues are whether he is an angry over-controlled man who acted because of jealousy and rage or whether he was a very depressed man who lost control because on the night before his anniversary, he went round to his wife's residence and found her in a house with a man with the lights off which to him implied there was sexual activity on the night before his anniversary. If there isn't compelling evidence that he was a man who was habitually violent, pathologically jealous, then my view has moved from his action being driven by anger primarily and jealousy primarily, although they were present because I think that was present in the genital mutilation but the emphasis in my mind has moved to this being a man who, in the context of his obsessive preoccupation personality and his observation of the relationship and with the depression, that he did lose control because of the significance of the moment for him being the anniversary and in the context of his depression.

...

Q. Now doctor if I could just read you some evidence that has been led before the Court here. Generally speaking one area of the evidence is that a discussion of his son [sic] ... that Mr Barry Corbett was rich and when he was told that that wasn't the case. Does that have any bearing on what you have been talking about?
A. That is a factor that might be put onto the jealousy and rage side of the equation I mentioned earlier.

Q. Does it tip more over on the jealousy and rage rather than the depression being the overriding factor?
A. Not absolutely but I think it is important. You see I think this behaviour was generated by jealousy and rage as well as depression. That is why this case is so complicated. It is not simply a homicide that occurred in the context of depression. The genital mutilation is not something that occurs when people are simply depressed. To cut off people's genitals you have to have other emotions present and that statement reinforces it. Powerful feelings of anger and jealousy must be underlying those behaviours.

...

Q. Is it possible that this is just the action of a man who is consumed by his rage more than anything else?

...

A. It is possible. That was my conclusion after the first assessment of him because of his presentation, not so much because of his history. My view shifted, I have to say, after the second examination. It is possible that anger and jealousy were the driving force but I think on balance had it not been the anniversary, had the deceased not been there and had he not been depressed, it is unlikely the homicide would have occurred"" (Transcript pp 291, 293, 296, 297, 298, 299).

GROUND OF APPEAL 1.1: SUBSTANTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF CAPACITY DEFENCE

27This ground of appeal is expressed in six sub-grounds appearing under the heading ""Substantial Impairment"". The 27 pages of submissions in support of this ground conclude with the following:

""The Crown's argument of 'premeditated murder' was based on the apparent awareness of the appellant at the time of the fatal incident therefore can not negate [sic] the defence case of substantially impaired capacity to understand, or to control the event. In the present case the evidence raised doubt whether it is safe to rely on inferences which would be drawn about the volition and intention of a reasonable man based on fact what he did, and a properly directed jury would have no difficulty entertaining a reasonable doubt about matters which the Crown had to prove"".

28Notwithstanding this reference to the defence of substantial impairment of capacity, all but one of the sub-grounds of appeal concern whether the appellant had an intent to kill Mr Corbett, which is an element of the offence of murder, but not of the defence of substantial impairment. If by this ground of appeal and supporting submissions the appellant seeks to assert that the Crown did not establish beyond reasonable doubt the elements of murder, it is difficult to see why the submissions appear under the heading ""Substantial Impairment"" and the submissions generally conclude with a contention that a verdict of manslaughter should be substituted for the verdict of murder, not that the Court should acquit the appellant. A claim for an acquittal would be baseless because (subject to the defences of substantial impairment of capacity and provocation) it is clear, on any view of the evidence, that the prosecution proved the elements of murder beyond reasonable doubt. As well, the appellant pleaded guilty to the manslaughter charge.

29In his Summing-Up, the trial judge told the jury that it was common ground that the accused did the act that caused the death of the deceased with the state of mind necessary for murder (Summing-Up p 13). Consistently with this, the appellant's counsel had commenced his final address to the jury as follows:

""Ladies and gentlemen, it's now my opportunity to address you in relation to aspects of the case and make submissions in relation to what I will, in shorthand, describe as the defence of substantial impairment. The reason I say it in that way is that it is patently self-obvious that no dispute has been made in this court as to those elements which the Crown needs to establish in their case"".

30In these circumstances, it seems that the better view is that the appellant's submissions on this ground are directed to the question of whether his actions were premeditated in a way that was inconsistent with incapacity to judge whether his actions were right or wrong and to control himself, and therefore inconsistent with his substantial impairment defence. This view is supported by the following appearing early in the appellant's submissions on this ground:

""It is obvious that the trial judge directed the jury to use the 'direct evidence' of the appellant's account to Dr Westmore in considering whether the appellant did have a guilty mind necessary for murder, and in this way forced the jury to use the 'ordinary person' test (objective test applicable in cases where the state of mind is not impaired by abnormality arising from underlying condition). Whether this approach in directing the jury was correct or contrary to established legal principles for cases of this kind, is of crucial importance and will be discussed later in this appeal in Ground Two. In the following paragraphs the discussion will be limited to the Crown's assertion that the evidence points towards premeditated murder"" ([27]).

31Seen in this way, and subject to what follows, the submissions on this ground are concerned with matters that may have been relevant to put to the jury, as the tribunal of fact. However, they do not in my view identify any basis upon which the jury verdicts could be challenged. 

32The first point that needs to be added is that the appellant's submissions erroneously assert, apparently in relation to s 23A(1)(a) of the Crimes Act, that the Crown contended that the relevant test was objective rather than subjective. That was not the case.

33Secondly, the appellant erroneously asserts that the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defence of substantial impairment of capacity has not been established. This is contrary to s 23A(4) which states that the onus is on the accused. 

34Thirdly, the appellant refers to ""the unanimous medical evidence"". For the reasons given below at [65], this is not a fair description of that evidence.

35Fourthly, the submissions on this ground embody an assertion that the verdicts are unsafe or unsatisfactory and that the appellant's conviction should be quashed (see s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912; SKA v R [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400). For the reasons given in this judgment, both earlier and below, I do not consider that the appellant has raised any matter that casts doubt upon the jury's verdicts. Having conducted an independent assessment of the evidence, my view is that the verdicts were well open to the jury, that the Crown proved its case against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt and that the appellant failing to establish his defence of substantial impairment of capacity on the balance of probabilities.

GROUND OF APPEAL [1.2]: PROVOCATION

36If a person charged with murder acted under provocation as defined in s 23 of the Crimes Act, he or she is entitled to be acquitted of murder but, if the elements of a murder charge are otherwise established, is guilty of manslaughter (s 23(1)). Where there is evidence of provocation, the onus is on the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the act or omission causing death was not an act done or omitted under provocation (s 23(4); Stingel v R [1990] HCA 61; 171 CLR 312 at 332 - 333). 

37Provocation was not raised at the trial by the appellant's counsel but if there was evidence of provocation fit to be left to the jury, it was the duty of the judge to instruct the jury that it was open, on that basis, to it to bring in a verdict of manslaughter (Van Den Hoek v R [1986] HCA 76; 161 CLR 158 at 161 - 162; Stingel at 334). The question for the trial judge to consider in this context is:

""Whether, on the version of events most favourable to the accused which is suggested by material in the evidence, a jury acting reasonably might fail to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the killing was unprovoked in the relevant sense"" (ibid).

38In these circumstances, this Court must consider whether there was sufficient evidence of provocation, as defined in s 23 of the Crimes Act, to require the judge to have left the issue to the jury.

39The starting point is to consider the nature and gravity of ""any conduct of the deceased (including grossly insulting words or gestures) towards or affecting the accused"" (s 23(2)).

40The appellant's written submissions describe the alleged provocative conduct as follows:

""The victim, although not even aware of himself being involved in a provocative conduct, offered the provocation to the appellant by being involved in an extramarital relationship with the appellant's estranged (but still legally married) wife, and at common law this is a sufficient 'implication' for the provocative conduct. The provocation although not directed at the appellant, it took place in the presence of him in a sufficiently unmistakeable way, by having the victim's car parked at the wife's parking place and by having the lights turned off in the early hours of the night"" ([191]).

41In Stingel, the High Court said in relation to s 160 of the Criminal Code (Tas):

""While personal characteristics or attributes of the particular accused may be taken into account for the purpose of understanding the implications and assessing the gravity of the wrongful act or insult, the ultimate question posed by the threshold objective test of s 160(2) relates to the possible effect of the wrongful act or insult, so understood and assessed, upon the power of self-control of a truly hypothetical 'ordinary person'. Subject to a qualification in relation to age (see below), the extent of the power of self-control of that hypothetical ordinary person is unaffected by the personal characteristics or attributes of the particular accused"" (at 327).

42This approach is applicable to s 23 of the Crimes Act (Green v R [1997] HCA 50; 191 CLR 334). Accordingly, the appellant's attributes and characteristics are to be considered in assessing the gravity of the provocation which he alleges he faced, but not in considering under s 23(2)(b) whether that provocation might have caused an ordinary person to so far lose his or her self-control as to have formed an intent to kill. 

43As it is sufficient under s 23(2)(a) that the loss of self-control was induced by conduct of the deceased ""affecting"" the accused, it is unnecessary for the conduct to have been directed at or in the presence of the accused (although that it was not may well be relevant to an assessment of how an ordinary person might have reacted to the provocation). As a result, Mr Corbett's conduct was capable of being regarded as conduct of the type to which s 23(2)(a) referred. Further, on the evidence as I have described it, it would have been open to the jury to take the view that the appellant did lose control and was induced to do so by Mr Corbett's conduct. No question of reasonableness of the appellant's response arises at this point. The issue posed by s 23(2)(a) is purely subjective. 

44The more relevant inquiry for the purposes of this appeal is whether the conduct of Mr Corbett could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the appellant ""to have so far lost self-control as to have informed an intent to kill"" (s 23(2)(b)). 

45As noted above, the gravity of the alleged provocation is to be assessed having regard to the appellant's personal characteristics. These included an obviously strict morality requiring faithfulness on the part of his wife even after a lengthy separation. For such a person, Mrs Corbett's conduct would have been significant. Of significance also would have been the conduct of Mr Corbett even though he did no more than have a relationship with a woman who was long-separated from her husband. He had no contact at all with her husband (if indeed he knew he existed). 

46I do not consider that an ordinary person (who, in accordance with Stingel, is not assumed to have the characteristics of the appellant) might have been induced by Mr Corbett's conduct to lose self-control to such an extent as to have formed an intent to kill Mr Corbett. In my view the formation of a serious intent to kill Mr Corbett is quite beyond the range of possible conduct of an ordinary person in such circumstances. The fact that the appellant had known of the relationship for over seven months is significant in showing that the ordinary person in the position of the appellant would have had, as the appellant did, much time for reflection (see Pollock v R [2010] HCA 35; 242 CLR 233 at [62]). Although the accused's actions need not have occurred ""suddenly"" after the provocation (see s 23(3)(b)), the passage of time between the provocation commencing and the killing may support the view, as I consider it does in the present case, that an ordinary person in the position of the accused would not have killed the victim. 

47As indicated by Barwick CJ in Johnson v R [1976] HCA 44; 136 CLR 619 at 634, ""[t]he importance of the fatal act having been taken in the heat of passion may ... be related ... to whether the provocative act or situation is such as would lead an ordinary man to lose self-control so as to do an act of the kind of the fatal act done by the accused"". Having known of the relationship for many months, an ordinary person in the position of the appellant would not have regarded observation of Mr Corbett's car at the Parramatta flat and the lights being out by 9.30 pm as adding anything significant to his knowledge. The present is a far-cry from a case where an accused has suddenly encountered a spouse in compromising circumstances or has been taunted by a spouse's lover. 

48The present evidence is far closer to that in Stingel where the court found that the trial judge had correctly declined to leave provocation to the jury. In that case a 19 year old man, who remained infatuated with a woman after termination of their relationship, discovered the woman and a man engaged in sexual activities in the man's parked car. After being told by the man to ""piss off"", the accused obtained a knife and stabbed the man to death.

49For these reasons, my view is that a jury, acting reasonably, could not have failed to have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that an ordinary person in the position of the appellant would not have been induced by Mr Corbett's conduct to kill him. A verdict to the contrary would have been unreasonable and quashed on appeal. As a result, the trial judge acted correctly in not leaving an issue of provocation to the jury.

GROUND OF APPEAL 2.1: MRS CORBETT'S EVIDENCE OF THE MARITAL RELATIONSHIP

50The appellant complains that Mrs Corbett's evidence of incidents of domestic violence on the part of the appellant should have been excluded, or limited in the use that could be made of it. As the appellant accepted that he had killed Mr Corbett, there could be no objection to the evidence on the ground that it showed a propensity of the appellant to violence and thus rendered the conclusion that he had killed Mr Corbett more likely.

51Evidence of the marital relationship, including the occurrence of any acts of domestic violence, was relevant to the determination of the issues arising under s 23A(1)(a) and was, understandably, treated by the expert forensic psychiatrists as relevant to their opinions. There was no basis for it to be excluded, limited in use or the subject of a warning to the jury. Overall, the evidence was in fact favourable to the appellant as it showed that he was not an habitually violent man, there having been only two isolated incidents of violence in Australia, both more than a decade earlier. That the appellant was not ""a man who was habitually violent"" was a factor leading to Dr Westmore's view, expressed after his second interview of the appellant and favourable to the appellant, that the appellant lost control ""because of the significance of the moment for him being the anniversary and in the context of his depression"", rather than as a result of anger and jealousy (Transcript p 296 - 7). Also favourably to the accused, the trial judge stated in his Summing-Up that ""there's no real convincing evidence that the accused is an habitually violent man"" and, later, that ""plainly he is not a violent man"" (Summing-Up pp 39 - 40).

GROUND OF APPEAL 2.2: THE TRIAL JUDGE'S DIRECTIONS CONCERNING S 23A

52The appellant complains that written directions that the trial judge provided to the jury would have been confusing to the jury in that, in part, they omitted reference to the words ""or to control himself"" in s 23A(1)(a). However, the omission was corrected and, in my view, any confusion was avoided.

GROUND OF APPEAL 2.3: THE RELEVANCE OF INTENTION TO KILL

53The appellant complains that the trial judge's directions failed to focus on the defence of substantial impairment of capacity but ""tended to direct back ... towards the intention to kill, which is subject to a verdict of murder"". In fact, appropriately, the trial judge focussed solely on the defence of substantial impairment of capacity, indicating that it was common ground that the elements of the offence of murder were established.

GROUND OF APPEAL 2.4: DIRECTIONS CONCERNING S 23A

54Under this ground of appeal, the appellant appears again to complain that the trial judge did not confine his focus to the defence of substantial impairment of capacity. As already stated, I do not accept this to be the case. I reject the submission that the appellant also appears to make that the trial judge did not make clear to the jury that the consequence of it finding that the defence had been established was that it was to return a verdict of manslaughter, rather than murder.

GROUND OF APPEAL 2.5: ABSENCE OF A WHITWORTH DIRECTION

55R v Whitworth [1989] 1 Qd R 437; 31 A Crim R 453 was concerned with legislation analogous to s 23A of the Crimes Act (NSW) in the terms in which it previously stood. That legislation required a relevant abnormality of mind to arise from one of a number of specified causes. That is not so under the present s 23A and in any event the expert psychiatrists agreed in the present case that a relevant abnormality of mind had been established. Accordingly, no occasion arose for a Whitworth direction.

GROUND OF APPEAL 2.6: THE ELEMENTS OF MURDER

56The appellant complains of the trial judge's statement to the jury that it was common ground that the elements of murder had been established and says:

""The third element of the murder however, namely, (c) that the offender committed the acts with the fault elements necessary for murder, was contested by raising the partial defence of manslaughter based on 'substantial impairment' and therefore it can not be said that it was 'common ground in this trial'"" (Written Submissions [236]).

57As pointed out in [28] above, the trial judge's reference to the establishment of the elements of murder being common ground was correct and appropriate. The appellant's reliance upon a defence under s 23A, which required different elements to be established than those that comprised the offence of murder, did not indicate that it was not common ground.

58Furthermore, contrary to the appellant's submission, the trial judge's identification to the jury of the issues for its consideration did not amount to an inappropriate expression by the trial judge of views concerning facts of the case.

59Under this ground of appeal the appellant also asserts that the trial judge usurped the role of the jury ""by rejecting the medical evidence"". For the reasons that are given below in relation to Ground of Appeal 2.8, the trial judge did not do this.

GROUND OF APPEAL 2.7: THE ELEMENTS OF MURDER

60The submissions in relation to this ground of appeal again assume that the appellant's raising of a defence of substantial impairment of capacity involved a challenge to the Crown's case that the elements of murder had been established. This was not so as the elements are different, and for reasons already given, the trial judge correctly treated it as common ground that the elements of murder had been established.

GROUND OF APPEAL 2.8: THE PSYCHIATRIC EVIDENCE

61The appellant first submits that in his Summing-Up the trial judge treated the test applicable to the defence under s 23A as objective rather than subjective. This is not correct as the trial judge clearly directed the jury that the question arising under s 23A(1)(a) was whether the appellant's abnormality of mind affected his capacity in the manner described in that subsection (a question raising a subjective rather than an objective issue). The judge appropriately distinguished the different (and objective) question for the jury's consideration arising under s 23A(1)(b).

62The appellant next submits that the trial judge erred ""in rejecting Dr Westmore's final opinion"", consistent with his submission elsewhere that the trial judge failed to acknowledge that the expert psychiatrists were in full agreement. 

63As noted in [24] above, Dr Westmore's opinion after his first interview of the appellant, was that the requirements of s 23A(1)(a) were not satisfied. After the second interview he reached a different view but stated that the issue was a difficult one involving two competing issues. Moreover he expressed his opinion in a tentative manner saying that, ""the emphasis in my mind has moved [to a view according with that of Dr Nielssen]"" (see [26] above). 

64Importantly also, Dr Westmore made it clear that he considered there to have been a significant difference between the histories that the appellant gave him in the two interviews and that the history he was given on the first occasion was ""more consistent with an angry, jealous revengeful man"" (see [26] above), that is, suggesting that s 23A(1)(a) had not been satisfied.

65In these circumstances, the jury would not have been entitled to regard Dr Westmore's second view as significant in the absence of it concluding that what the appellant told Dr Westmore at the second interview correctly reflected his state of mind at the time of the killing. As a result, it would have been inappropriate for the trial judge to inform the jury, as the appellant submits he should have, that the views of the two psychiatrists as to the issues arising under s 23A(1)(a) were the same and that it should regard their evidence as determinative of those issues. Dr Westmore's evidence raised an issue for the jury of which description by the appellant of his state of mind was most accurate.

66The appellant further complains that in his Summing-Up the trial judge did not give a fair description of the psychiatric evidence. I do accept this submission. Whilst the trial judge did not in his Summing-Up refer to Dr Westmore's second opinion as to whether the appellant's capacity was substantially impaired by his abnormality of mind, he did not refer to the earlier different opinion either. The psychiatrists' opinions were dealt with at length in the addresses of the Crown Prosecutor and appellant's counsel and it was in my view unnecessary for the trial judge to descend to any greater detail in his Summing-Up than he did.

GROUND OF APPEAL 2.9: THE APPELLANT'S ELECTRONICALLY RECORDED INTERVIEW

67The appellant complains that the trial judge did not refer in his Summing-Up to the appellant's ERISP interview, the record of which was tendered by the Crown. However, there was no need for the judge to refer to all of the evidence in the case and the appellant's counsel did not submit at the trial that the judge should have referred to the interview. Indeed, the appellant's submissions on appeal do not clearly indicate any reason why the recording was of significance.

GROUND OF APPEAL 2.10: DISPARAGEMENT OF DEFENCE CASE

68The appellant complains that in his Summing-Up the trial judge disparaged the appellant's case. The references given by the appellant do not raise any arguable case that that was so.

69The appellant also submits under this heading that the trial judge failed to instruct the jury that it was for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that an impairment of the type described in s 23A did not exist. Such a direction would have been erroneous as the accused bears the onus of establishing the defence of substantial impairment of capacity (see s 23A(4)).

GROUND OF APPEAL 2.11: CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE

70The appellant complains that the ""trial judge's direction[s] to the jury about the circumstantial evidence and the dangers of drawing inferences from them were insufficient and inadequate"". 

71This was not a case in which the Crown attempted to prove by circumstantial evidence that the accused did the act in question, as there was here no dispute that he did it. Rather, there was evidence, for example from the appellant's family, of facts and circumstances relevant to the establishment of his s 23A defence. The trial judge gave an appropriate caution about the jury too readily drawing inferences. No further direction was required.

GROUND OF APPEAL 2.12: BIAS OF THE TRIAL JUDGE

72The appellant complains that in his Summing-Up the trial judge referred to evidence concerning the appellant's conduct and attitudes, and expressed the view that ""[h]e was a man apparently with very strong morals, especially as regards sex, and rigid about it"" (Summing-Up pp 40 - 41). This was not an inappropriate comment, and the evidence made its correctness obvious. In any event the jury was told that matters of fact were for its decision.

73The appellant's submissions in relation to this ground of appeal do not, in this respect or otherwise, raise any arguable case that there was any apparent bias on the part of the trial judge in relation to any particular aspect of the trial, or generally.

GROUND OF APPEAL 2.13: SENTENCING

74The submissions in relation to this ground of appeal relate to the sentences imposed upon the appellant. They are dealt with separately below.

GROUND OF APPEAL 3.1: THE LIMBS OF S 23A(1)

75The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in treating s 23A(1)(a) and (b) as involving separate issues for consideration by the jury. The trial judge was correct in doing so. Paragraph (a) relates to the existence of a relevant substantial impairment. Paragraph (b) imposes a further requirement to be satisfied for the defence to succeed, that ""the impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter"".

GROUND OF APPEAL 3.2: S 23A(1)(b)

76The appellant complains that the trial judge's direction to the jury to apply ""the community standard"" when considering whether the impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter (s 23A(1)(b)) was erroneous. I do not agree. In directing attention to how an ""ordinary person"" would act, that paragraph clearly requires consideration of community standards.

GROUND OF APPEAL 3.3: TIMING OF SUBSTANTIAL IMPAIRMENT DIRECTIONS

77The appellant complains that the trial judge should have explained the relevance of the psychiatric evidence to the jury when it was being admitted. However this was unnecessary as the evidence was referred to, and its relevance explained, in the Crown Prosecutor's opening address.

GROUND OF APPEAL 3.4: THE ""ORDINARY PERSON"" REFERRED TO IN S 23(2)(b)

78The appellant submits that his mental condition of depression should be imputed to the ""ordinary person"" in considering whether the requirement of s 23(2)(b) has been satisfied. This would be contrary to the binding authority of Stingel which, as noted in [41] above, holds that subject only to a qualification in relation to age, ""the extent of the power of self-control of [the] hypothetical ordinary person is unaffected by the personal characteristics or attributes of the particular accused"" (at 327). The position is otherwise in the assessment of the gravity of the particular provocation (see 326). 

GROUND OF APPEAL 4: MALICIOUS WOUNDING

79The appellant submits that if he succeeds in relation to the murder charge, on provocation or his defence under s 23A, the mental element required to convict him on the charge of malicious wounding of Mrs Corbett is negated. For the reasons I have given, this condition is not satisfied as I do not consider that he is entitled to succeed either in relation to s 23 or s 23A. As a result, his challenge to his conviction for malicious wounding fails.

GROUND OF APPEAL 5: INCOMPETENCE OF COUNSEL

80The appellant alleges that his counsel at trial was incompetent because he failed to address ""crucial issues"". 

81The first mistake alleged by the appellant is that his counsel did not challenge ""the Crown's hypothesis of the preparations, planning and intention to kill"". There were clearly issues at the trial as to the appellant's preparations and alleged planning for the killing, relevant to when he formed an intention to kill. These bore on the substantial impairment of capacity defence under s 23A. In this context, the appellant gave evidence that sought to meet the Crown's contention that the killing was premeditated. In these circumstances, I reject the appellant's submission.

82Secondly, the appellant submits that his counsel erred in ""not challenging the issue of malicious wounding on the ground of involuntariness"". This submission is misconceived as it was irrelevant that the appellant did not intend to stab Mrs Corbett if he did so in the course of intentionally stabbing Mr Corbett. That was clearly the case.

83Thirdly, the appellant submits that his counsel erred in not requesting the trial judge to give adequate directions to the jury on the issue of substantial impairment. As adequate directions were in fact given, this submission fails.

SENTENCE APPEAL (GROUND OF APPEAL 2.13)

84Following the jury's verdicts, the trial judge sentenced the appellant, for his murder conviction, to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 18 years commencing on 2 August 2006, with a balance of term of 6 years. For the offence of malicious wounding, the trial judge sentenced the appellant to a fixed term of 4 years commencing on 2 August 2006. That sentence was accordingly wholly concurrent with the other sentence.

85The appellant first submits that in his Remarks on Sentence dated 29 February 2008 the trial judge wrongly concluded, and took into account, that:

- The attack was planned and carried out in ""a cool, stealthy way"".
- ""The persons should have been in the privacy of their own home"".
- The ""savage and sustained nature of the attack"".

86These findings of fact were ones that were well open to his Honour and were consistent with the jury's verdicts. The appellant does not identify any arguable basis for challenging the findings made by his Honour as follows:

""I think that on 1 August 2006 the offender carried out an act he had been thinking about for some time. It had its beginnings, perhaps, in his remarks that people who stole other people's wives went unpunished and that in other countries people who committed adultery were stoned to death. Although I do not accept that he went to [Parramatta] to gain inspiration for an anniversary card I do think that the fact of the anniversary motivated him. I do not accept that he just happened to have with him the keys, the torch and the knife. I think that he left home with the intention of entering the flat and attacking Mr Corbett. His intent was to punish him by killing him for stealing another man's wife. His disposal of the severed penis was intended to teach Mrs Corbett a lesson for her adultery (Remarks on Sentence p 11).

...

The features that tend to require a longer sentence are the cool, stealthy way the offender planned his attack and carried out by surprise on persons who should have been safe in the privacy of their own home, the savage and sustained nature of the attack, the disgusting mutilation of Mr Corbett's body after death and histrionic use of the magazine in the drawer"" (Remarks on Sentence p 13).


87The matters referred to in [85] above were aggravating features that the trial judge was entitled to take into account under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Contrary to the appellant's submissions, the sentencing judge was not precluded from taking into account any of these matters on the basis that they formed part of the elements of the offence of murder.

88The appellant next submits that the sentencing judge failed to take into account his ""pre-trial disclosure"" and mental condition. The judge did however take account of the appellant's limiting of his challenges to the Crown's case and his economical conduct of his case (Remarks on Sentence, p 13). As well, the judge took into account the appellant's depression (ibid).

89The appellant's challenge to his sentence erroneously refers to ""the unanimous evidence of both psychiatrists"". For the reasons I have given in [65] above this is not a fair statement of the state of the evidence. 

90The appellant also asserts that the judge ""did not consider the mitigating factors with the standard of proof on the balance of probability required by law in cases which rely on defence of diminished responsibility pursuant to s 23A"" (Written Submissions [373]). There is however nothing to suggest that the judge applied a higher standard than the balance of probabilities in making findings about mitigating factors.

91I reject the appellant's further submission that his sentence for the offence of murder was manifestly excessive. In my view the matters referred to in [86] and in the remainder of the judge's Remarks on Sentence well justified the sentence he imposed, bearing in mind particularly the prima facie applicable sentence for murder of imprisonment for life (see s 19A of the Crimes Act and s 21 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act), the relevant standard non-parole period of 20 years (Division 1A Table, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act) and the savage and (according to the standards of ordinary people) unprovoked nature of the appellant's attack on Mr Corbett. 

ORDERS

92For the reasons that I have given, I propose the following orders:

(1) The time for the appellant to appeal against his conviction is extended to enable his purported appeal to be brought.

(2) The appeal against conviction is dismissed.

(3) Leave to appeal against sentence is refused.

93FULLERTON J: I agree with Macfarlan JA.

94CAMPBELL J: I have had the great benefit of reading the judgment of Macfarlan JA in draft. I agree with his Honour's reasons and with the orders he proposes. In particular, I wish to express my agreement with what his Honour has written about Ground 1.1. I agree that an independent assessment of the evidence demonstrates that its verdicts were well open to the jury. As his Honour has demonstrated the psychiatric evidence was not all one way. That evidence left it open for the jury to convict if it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the facts assumed by Dr. Westmore at the time of his initial assessment represented what happened and why on the night Mr. Corbett was killed. In resolving that question the jury having seen and heard the witnesses, including the appellant, enjoyed an advantage that cannot be recreated in a court of criminal appeal. In my view, that advantage would have been crucial to the jury in resolving the psychiatric question which Dr. Westmore's evidence in particular left open for their determination.

2707139,R v DJY (No2) [2013] NSWDC 19,"Judgment


Introduction

1DJY makes application for a certificate to be issued pursuant to s 2 Costs in Criminal Cases Act (1967), hereinafter referred to as ""the Act"". The applicant was arraigned on 17 September 2012 in the Sydney District Court on an indictment alleging seven counts in respect of the complainant, RAY, who is the applicant's daughter. The counts comprised an allegation of indecent assault of a person under 16 years (namely 7 or 8 years) (Count 1), allegedly committed in 1982; four allegations of aggravated indecent assault, allegedly committed in or about 1987 when she was 12 or 13 years of age (Counts 2-5); and two counts of sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 16 years in circumstances of aggravation allegedly committed between 1988 and 1989 when she was 14 or 15 years of age (Counts 6 and 7). The crimes alleged against the accused were said to be committed at, or about, Dapto, Bermagui and/or at Bellingen (or Urunga). The applicant was acquitted by direction in respect of Counts 4 and 6 and was acquitted by verdict of the jury in respect of the remaining counts. The Director of Public Prosecutions (the respondent) opposes the granting of a certificate. 

2The respondent tendered several statements obtained by police as ""additional evidence"" pursuant to s 3A of the Act on the hearing of the application. These statements were from RAY (23 June 2010), her mother DL (15 October 2012 and 19 July 2010), GY (the applicant's brother), dated 16 December 2009, and PY (a nephew), dated 29 September 2010). The additional evidence was relied upon as relevant to assessing the reasonableness of the prosecution's decision to institute the proceedings. In material respects portions of the statements were ""footnoted"" or referred to in the prosecution's submissions. The applicant relies upon the oral evidence and exhibits from the trial.

3Written submissions have been provided by the applicant and the Crown supplemented by oral submissions from counsel. It is not submitted that the applicant unreasonably contributed to the institution or continuation of the proceedings (s 3(1)(b) of the Act).

General outline of the Crown case

4The complainant was the daughter of the applicant and DL, a witness in the trial for the prosecution. She was born on 13 February 1974, her parents separated in about 1980. They had four children. The applicant entered into a relationship with his brother's wife CY shortly afterwards. They, with her three children and up to three of his children (from time to time), lived at Dapto, Cobargo, near Bermagui and near Bellingen, at Urunga, over the period of time covered by the allegations in the indictment. The applicant when living near Bermagui and at Urunga was a professional fisherman. Some of the counts and the 'context' evidence concerned allegations of sexual assault whilst he was engaged in ""fishing"" activities. 

5The complainant's mother lived at Mackay in Queensland. She suffered a serious health injury around about the eighth birthday of the complainant as a result of which the complainant was sent to stay with relatives in Sydney and with the accused in Dapto for part of that time. It was during that stay in Dapto that the first count arose. The complainant alleged frequent sexual assault during that period of time. 

6The accused, CY and their other children moved from Dapto to Cobargo and then to nearby Bermagui. The complainant moved to live with her father in Bermagui in, or about, 1986 at about the age of 12, after having returned to live with her mother in the intervening period. At Bermagui counts 2, 3, 4 and 5 were alleged to have been committed, along with other sexual abuse. She moved with the accused, CY and their children to Urunga. The complainant moved back to live with her mother in Queensland during September 1989. She made complaint after returning to Mackay, prior to 12 November 1990, about the conduct of the accused to her father's brother (GY), his sister (CC) and her mother. The complainant lived in the Mackay area for several more years and had a daughter. When the daughter was an infant RAY moved back to live with the accused and his wife at Urunga in 1993, before moving to live nearby. She had two more children whilst living in that area. In about April/May 1998 she finally split from her father and step-mother during a custody dispute. She brought her allegations against the accused to the attention of police in late 2009 or early 2010, and made a full statement in June 2010. 

7In addition to the evidence of the complainant, other evidence in the Crown case included evidence of the complaints made to the complainant's mother (DL), her uncle (GY) and aunt (CC). These complaints were made in 1990, though some of the witnesses vaguely suggested 1988/1989. There was also evidence of the police investigations including a ""forensic examination"" of the accused's penis to locate a ""tick scar"" or ""hole"" that the complainant said she had seen during the course of one of the later sexual assaults. The accused's wife gave a statement to police in December 2009. Documentary exhibits were tendered in the Crown case largely relevant to establishing the timing of the movements of the complainant, and/or the applicant, and the complaints to relatives. A photograph of the accused's penis was also tendered from the ""forensic examination"" during the police investigation. 

8A background aspect of the trial of these allegations was that the accused was tried in 2011 in respect of allegations by PY (CY's son) for which he was acquitted. I gave judgment separating that trial from that concerning this complainant on 25 July 2011. I awarded a certificate under the Act in relation to that trial on 20 December 2011. The applicant was tried in relation to allegations of PY's sister by his Honour Judge Berman SC and was acquitted in 2012, before the trial of RAY's allegations. 

The Defence Case

9The accused gave evidence, denying the allegations and providing details of the circumstances in which he had contact with the complainant over the period of the assaults and subsequently. Evidence was also given by CY and her daughter (MY) concerning the circumstances of the complainant living with the accused and his family in New South Wales and the character of the relationship of the complainant with the accused and CY, up until the final estrangement. This occurred approximately 12 years before the complainant made her allegations to the police in 2010. In cross examination of the complainant and in the evidence of the applicant and his wife, correspondence from the complainant to them and various photographs were admitted as exhibits (Exhibits 1,3 -9).

Relevant legislation and principles to be applied

10The Costs in Criminal Cases Act, 1967 relevantly provides:

""s.2 The Court or Judge ..... in any proceedings relating to an offence ... punishable ... upon indictment may -

... where a defendant, after a hearing on the merits, is acquitted ... as to the information then under inquiry ..... grant to that defendant a certificate under this Act, specifying the matters referred to in s.3 relating to those proceedings.

s.3 (1) A certificate granted under this Act shall specify that, in the opinion of the Court ...... granting the certificate - 


(a) if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, been in possession of evidence of all the relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings; and


(b) that any act or omission of the defendant that contributed or might have contributed, to the institution or continuation of the proceedings was reasonable in the circumstances"".

11The relevant provisions of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act have been considered in a number of decisions of the Court of Appeal and the Court of Criminal Appeal. In Allerton v Director of Public Prosecutions ((1991) 24 NSWLR 550 ) the Court of Appeal held:

""... (T)he task of court or judge, justice or justices in specifying their opinion is indeed to ask a hypothetical question, (as set out in s.3(1)(a)). But that question is addressed to evidence of all of the relevant facts, whether discovered before arrest or before committal (if any); after committal and before trial, during the trial or afterwards, admitted under s.3A of the Act. All of the relevant facts proved, whenever they became known to the prosecution and whether or not in evidence at the trial, must then be considered by the decision maker. The decision maker must then ask whether, if the prosecution had evidence of all the relevant facts immediately before the proceedings were instituted it would not have reasonable to institute the proceedings"" (559G-560B) - emphasis added.

12In Mordaunt v DPP [2007] NSWCA 121, McColl JA at [36] summarised the principles arising from the decided cases to be considered in relation to applications for a certificate under the Act. 

13Relevant to this application from that summary the following matters are noted.

i. The Costs in Criminal Cases Act is reforming legislation with a beneficial purpose designed to confer valuable privileges upon persons who succeed in criminal prosecutions; its provisions should not be narrowly construed so as to defeat the achievement of its general purposes.

ii. The ""institution of proceedings"" in s.3 refers to the time of arrest or charge not to some later stage such as committal for trial or the finding of a bill.

iii. The applicant for a s.2 certificate bears the onus of showing it was not reasonable to institute the proceedings. It is not for the Crown to establish, or the Court to conclude, that institution of proceedings was, or ought to have been, reasonable in the circumstances.

iv. The task of the Court dealing with an application under the Act is to ask the hypothetical question: ""if the prosecution had evidence of all the relevant facts immediately before the proceedings were instituted, would it not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings?""

v. The judicial officer considering the application must find what were ""all the relevant facts"" and assume the prosecution to have been ""in possession of evidence of"" all of them and must then determine whether, if the prosecution had been in possession of those facts before the proceedings were instituted ""it would not have been reasonable to institute (the proceedings)"" - an applicant for the certificate must succeed on both the ""facts issue"" and the ""reasonableness issue"".

vi. The hypothetical question is addressed to the evidence of all the relevant facts whether discovered before arrest or at any other time, including after the trial, if admitted under s.3A of the Act. All of those facts must be considered. The relevant facts are concerned with the threshold question posed by s.3(1)(a); other facts will also be relevant and admissible going amongst other things to the question posed by s.3(1)(b) and to the ultimate question whether, assuming that the Court is of the opinion required to be specified, it should exercise its discretion under s.2 (of the Act).

vii. Courts should not attempt to prescribe an exhaustive test of what constitutes ""unreasonableness"" for the institution of the proceedings, but the matters that are set out in subparagraphs (h)-(n) of [36] of Mordaunt are germane (set out in (viii)-(xi) below in part).

viii. The reasonableness of a decision to institute proceedings is not based upon the test that prosecution or agencies throughout Australia use for the discretionary test for continuing to prosecute, namely whether there is any reasonable prospect of conviction .... the test cannot be a test of reasonable suspicion which might justify an arrest and it cannot be the test which determines whether the prosecution is malicious.

ix. The fact a prosecution may be launched where there is evidence to establish a prima facie case does not mean it is reasonable to launch a prosecution; there may be cases where there is contradictory evidence and where it is reasonable to expect a prosecutor to make some evaluation of the evidence.

x. The fact that a Court concluded the evidence was insufficient to warrant a conviction is not necessarily indicative of unreasonableness, neither is the entering of a judgment of acquittal.

xi. S.3 of the Act calls for an objective analysis of the whole of the relevant evidence ... matters of judgment concerning credibility, demeanour and the like are likely to fall on the other side of the line of unreasonableness, being matters quintessentially in the realm of the ultimate fact finder. If the question for a jury depended upon ""word against word"" in the majority of such cases it would be quite reasonable for the prosecution to allow those matters to be decided by the jury. It would be different where the word upon which the Crown case depended had been demonstrated to be one which was very substantially lacking in credit.

xii. It is relevant to have regard both to the information in the possession of the prosecuting authorities and the conduct of the defendant, given the adversarial nature of a criminal prosecution.

xiii. S.3(1)(b) recognises tactical considerations are legitimate in the defence of criminal charges. 

xiv The judge must form the relevant opinions and also exercise the residual discretion contemplated by s.2 to grant a certificate.

14Reference was made in submission by the respondent to Regina v Bernard Lawrence Johnston [2000] NSWCCA 197 and R v Manley (2000) 49 NSWLR 203. Those submissions are noted below .The majority of the Court in Johnston rejected the argument that the relevant discretion to grant a certificate (or not grant a certificate as the case may be) was that it was proper to prosecute because ""it is necessary that justice be seen to be done"". Her Honour Simpson J, stated:

""I would .....expressly reject the argument by the Crown that a relevant consideration in the evaluative process and the exercise of the discretion is that ""it is necessary that justice seem to be done"". The perception that justice is done is not advanced by the unreasonable institution of criminal prosecutions nor those based on evidence known to be inadequate to sustain a conviction"" [19].

15Her Honour also said that a relevant matter for the prosecutor's consideration was the issue of delay in complaint, which required ""careful scrutiny"" (at [26]). 

The applicant's submissions

16In the context of the above principles the applicant's essential submission is that, having regard to the relevant material, the complainant, upon whom the Crown case entirely depended, was a witness substantially lacking in credit. The applicant's written submissions refer to a number of aspects of matters arising from the evidence as reflecting the lack of credibility of the allegations made by the complainant. Those matters submitted included, in summary:

(1)In respect of the events at Dapto, the complainant was challenged as to whether in fact she stayed at Dapto more than two or three days, thus making impossible allegations of repetitious sexual assault. The applicant's counsel referred to evidence at the trial of the large number of people in the house, the layout of the house, the existence or not of a blanket on the lounge under which the assaults could occur, the routine of the house not permitting the assaults to occur, the work habits of the applicant and other matters. Reference was also made to the significantly delayed complaint to investigating police (of 27 years) in relation to this count, the absence of supporting evidence as well as the contradiction of the complainant's evidence in respect of the above matters from the applicant and his wife. 

(2)The delayed complaint was unexplained, the complainant having ample opportunity to complain to her mother or others well before her first complaints in circumstances where she understood what she alleged the applicant was doing was wrong. The failure to complain to the applicant's now wife in circumstances where she conceded a close relationship, underlined by the contemporaneous communications by the complainant to her. 

(3)There was evidence of the ""counter indicative"" conduct of the complainant in returning to live with the applicant, firstly in Bermagui and then in Bellingen and the contradictory behaviour in respect of counts 6 and 7 of working with him in the Bellingen area given the claimed history of sexual assaults. 

(4)The complainant's evidence of her fishing expeditions with the applicant lacked detail of the method of fishing. 

(5)The evidence the complainant gave as to a purported ""hole"" in the penis of the applicant and its location was contradicted by both the circumstances in which she claimed to have seen it and evidence as to its appearance. 

(6)The complainant's observed relationship with the accused and the communications she made to the wife of the applicant contradicted her claims of consistent sexual assault. 

(7)Reliance was had upon the detail of the accused's evidence and his denials, as well as that of his wife. Further it was submitted that the evidence of MY contradicted aspects of the complainant's evidence. 

17Oral submissions were made by the applicant's counsel dealing with the following additional issues:


i)The detail of complaint evidence given by the complainant's mother that the accused had made her perform oral sex and masturbate him, was contradicted by the complainant's recollection of her ""complaint"" to her mother. 


ii)The claims of the mother that complaint of sexual abuse had been communicated to Mackay Police was not confirmed by police records and was contradicted by the absence of any police action.


iii)On the other hand, DL had spoken to DOCS about her daughter in 1989/90, yet, whilst dealing with aspects of her daughter's situation, there was no complaint or allegation raised in the context of the welfare of the complainant being addressed, of any complaint of sexual abuse by the father made to DOCS. 


iv)The evidence from the mother of the complainant that she had gone to police in 1990 seeking assistance in relation to accommodation was not supported by any records of any allegation of sexual abuse in NSW to the Queensland police. 


v)Reference was made to the complainant's evidence that she had reluctantly returned to live with the applicant after she had her first child because she had no where else to go. The evidence of the mother contradicted her insofar as she was never consulted about her daughter's return to live with her father, the first she knew about it was when she said she saw the removal van outside her daughter's home. There was evidence from the complainant and from the mother that, in fact, the complainant had left MacKay at a time when she had got into some ""legal trouble"" which resulted in a court appearance and an order for her to pay compensation for monies defrauded. 


vi)The material produced in the defence case, particularly material such as the card to the father in 1997 (exhibit 7a), in which she wrote that the applicant was the ""best father"" that she knew, was entirely inconsistent with the course of abused that she had alleged the accused had perpetrated between 1984 and 1990.


vii)The contents of the Family Law Court affidavit filed by the complainant early 1998, particularly her claim that she had left her children in the care of other members of the family for periods up to four days, was contradicted by the evidence she had given in court. This was not just a matter of ""credit"" but reflected adversely upon her capacity to tell the truth. 

18It was submitted that these various matters went beyond ""credibility"" and what reasonably might be expected for a jury to resolve. They demonstrated the complainant's evidence to be materially untruthful or so unreliable as to not justify the institution of proceedings. It was submitted that the application did not necessarily depend upon one matter. The combination of issues that a prosecutor would be required to consider before instituting proceedings, arising from the evidence at trial, would lead to a conclusion that it was unreasonable to institute the proceedings. 

Crown Submissions

19The submissions were in writing. No oral submissions were made in reply to the oral submissions of counsel for the applicant. In summary, the Crown's submissions centred upon the decisions of Manley (2000) 49 NSWLR 203 and Johnson [2000] NSWCCA 197, particularly that ""matters of judgment concerning credibility, demeanour and the like are likely to fall on the other side of unreasonableness, being matters quintessentially in the realm of the ultimate fact finder, whether it be judge or jury"". The Crown conceded that the Crown case against the applicant depended entirely upon the evidence of the complainant and that thus the matter of judgment depended upon ""credibility, demeanour and the like of the complainant"". 

20The Crown referred to the absence of evidence by the complainant leading to a verdict by direction in respect of count 4, given the ""reasonably anticipated evidence of the complainant"", set out in her statement that was tendered. Likewise, the verdict by direction in relation to count 6 because of failure to give evidence of relevant matters, arose in circumstances where it was ""reasonably anticipated"" given the complainant's statement that that evidence would be available. 

21The respondent relied upon the complainant's assertion of regular sexual conduct with the accused, complaints that she made to others and other complaints made subsequently after 2000 reflecting consistency of conduct. The Crown also submitted that the issue as to the ""hole in the penis"" of the accused was a matter that militated in favour of her credibility.

22The respondent finally submitted that the jury had to ultimately ask itself, ""were we satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth and accuracy of what she was saying"", the fact that the verdicts of not guilty were returned ""does not mean that they (the jury) accepted the innocence of the accused, and the fact that the matter went to the jury meant that the conflicting assertions of guilt and innocence were properly matters within the province of the jury"". 

Consideration

23A starting point of the determination of this matter is to be found in the observations of Wood CJ at CL in Manley (at [14]), that ""matters of judgment concerning credibility, demeanour and the like are likely to fall on the other side of the line of unreasonableness, being matters quintessentially within the realm of the ultimate fact finder ... "" (para 5 Crown submissions). Naturally, I accept this proposition.

24The respondent correctly stated in its written submissions (at para 21) that there was fundamentally one question for the jury at trial to ask itself of the complainant's evidence (in respect of the counts remaining). But it is not correct to assert that because a verdict of 'not guilty' meant that the jury did not (necessarily) ""accept ... the innocence of the accused"", that is determinative of this application. There is no requirement that the ""decision maker"" must be satisfied that an applicant is ""innocent"" before a certificate is issued in exercise of the relevant discretion. But, of course, such a finding may require the issue of such a certificate. 

25The respondent's submissions concerning matters of ""credibility"" as best left for evaluation by the tribunal of fact, thus militating in favour of the decision to institute the proceedings, cannot be assessed solely by an examination of the complainant's evidence or the statements available to the prosecution of witnesses called in the prosecution case or from statements available to the prosecution from the police investigation. The respondent's submissions gave no credit, nor was reference made, to the many matters that emerged in cross examination of the complainant that undermined her credibility and truthfulness. Nor was there reference to other evidence in the case, which the ""decision maker"" must consider as part of ""all the relevant facts"", to determine whether or not it was reasonable to institute the proceedings. To limit the matter, the way that the respondent did in its submissions, denies recognition of other evidence in the trial which the ""decision maker"" is required to take into account. 

26The respondent's submissions did not address those aspects of trial which ultimately lead to the discrediting of the complainant as reflected by the jury verdicts and which are relevant ""facts"" required to be considered in the context of the principles in Allerton. These matters included the ""delayed complaint"" to her mother, and others, without any or any adequate explanation, the conflicting terms of complaint, the evidence in the accused's case and the documentary evidence in correspondence, photos and cards reflecting upon the contemporaneous feelings of the complainant about the accused and CY. The complainant's identification of an injury to the applicant's penis, drawing a ""diagram"" of the hole's location, which the Crown submitted enhanced her credibility, ultimately did not, as discussed below in [31]. 

27Putting aside the accused's sworn denials of guilt, there were a number of outstanding features that arose in the trial, which are required to be taken into account as part of ""all the relevant facts"" known before the proceedings were instituted. 

28Those matters included: 

i. In respect of count 1, given the complainant did not attend school at Dapto, but attended school at Sydney whilst absent from her mother's care, she had a limited period living at Dapto with the accused, CY and the other children in which alleged repetitious sexual activity could have occurred. There were also features of the living circumstances of the family that were at odds with the claimed conduct occurring while the applicant and the complainant were alone in the living room, detailed in the applicant's submissions. 

ii. Prior to the events giving rise to counts 2 - 5, concerning her time in the Bermagui area, the complainant voluntarily returned to live with the accused and CY, and remained voluntarily for between 3 and 4 years living with him, firstly in Bermagui and then at Urunga on the North Coast.

iii. The complainant, just before 23 September 1989, was forced to leave the accused's home on the insistence of CY because of her misbehaviour, returning to Mackay to live with her mother in circumstances where she was not welcome by her stepfather. Her circumstances in Queensland were tenuous, having eventually to leave her mother's home.

iv. Notwithstanding her assertion in her evidence in chief of systematic abuse by the accused and a distant, strained and cold relation with CY, the complainant on, or about, 23 September 1989 after her return to Mackay wrote to CY professing her ""love"" for her, stating that she was ""missing her heaps"" and ""lov(ing) (her) always"". She stated that she ""appreciated"" her ""looking after me for about 4 years"" and apologised for ""being such a bitch of a kid to handle"". She asked that MY, who at the trial gave evidence contradicting matters asserted by the complainant about her relationship with the accused, to write to her as she ""missed her heaps"". She concluded the letter by writing ""l love you (Aunty C) ... I always will"". In 1997 she wrote to the accused: 

""See, I topped the last gift didn't I?!!!I No, it's the thought that counts isn't it. And I think about you everyday, not just today! Your (sic) the best Dad a girl could ask for. Thanks for being there when I need you! Remember, I am here for you whenever you need me too! Love you. Love you heaps and always will ... Love (RAY, JS, DB and R)"" 

The Crown's submission to the jury in relation to this card that, despite what her father had done (years of sexual abuse), she still loved him was myopic. Reflected, in part, by the speed in which the jury subsequently returned verdicts of 'not guilty'. This material had relevance not only to the general credibility of her evidence, but to other issues, such as the genuineness of her ""complaint"" to GY, CC and DL at an earlier time. 

v. Although she returned to Mackay in about September 1989, complainants were made first to GY, when, having fallen out with her mother, she was without accommodation and seeking accommodation from him, then CC and then her mother, probably on, or very shortly before, 12 November 1990. This was over a year after she had left the ""care"" of the accused. Exhibit E (a transcription of Mackay Hospital notes) stated: ""I received several (calls re RAY) from her Mum and Uncle concerning ... complex family (history) ... including sexual abuse by her father (9.30 am - 12 November 1990)"". No reasonable explanation was offered by the complainant as to the delay in complaint in relation to even the then most recent alleged act of sexual assault. 

vi. There was no convincing evidence that any complaint about the accused's alleged conduct was laid with Queensland Police on her return to Queensland. The evidence of DL and the complainant was at odds in this respect and no record existed of such an event. 

vii. The evidence at trial (noting the contents of relevant statements tendered on this application) of the terms of the complaints to family members were not consistent with each other, or, in some respects, with the allegations made against the accused.

In the evidence at trial:


a) RAY complained to GY only in relation to matters consistent (in general terms) with counts 6 and 7.


b) she alleged to her mother particulars of sexual abuse, such as ""fellatio"" and the use of a ""vibrator"" not the subject of evidence at trial. 


c) her recollection at trial of the terms of the complaints to her mother was different than that of DL.

viii. The delay in bringing the allegations forward to the police was essentially unexplained. The various delays detracted from her credibility, even allowing for directions as to the caution that the jury had to exercise in this regard. Furthermore, the failure to complain to CY, in light of the complainant's correspondence attesting her affection for her was also unexplained. Further, her professed disappointment at having to return to Queensland in 1989 stood at odds with claims of regular abuse and the claims she made concerning the character of her relationship with CY.

ix. Subsequently, the complainant in 1993 voluntarily returned to live with the accused and his wife, or nearby them, for a period between 1993 and 1998. She brought her then only child with her and had two further children whilst living in the Urunga area. A number of cards she sent to the accused and/or CY reflect a close and loving relationship with CY and the accused and gratitude for their continuing support.

x. Although the complainant alleged concern for the welfare of her children and concern about leaving them alone with the accused, eventually claiming she ""snapped"" in 1998 when she saw one of her children in the presence of the accused, yet the evidence established clearly that she regularly left her children at various times in the care of CY, the accused and other family members. 

xi. The evidence contained within the affidavit sworn by her in April/May 1998 in respect of custody proceedings, was at odds with her evidence at trial concerning her reliance on members of the family to care for her children. 

xii. This affidavit was sworn in the context of a custody dispute with the father of at least one of her children, born in September 1995, in which the accused and CY had taken sides with the father. Her evidence sought to exaggerate any concern that she had for her children and down play the role of the accused, CY and other family members in the care of her children. The jury reasonably could regard her evidence in this regard as untruthful.

xiii. The documentary exhibits created in various ways by RAY contradicted the claimed relationship with the accused and CY. For example a birth notice for one of her children born in September 1995, lodged by the complainant and her partner, thanked the accused and CY ""for all their help and support"" during the birth (Exhibit 8b). Cards sent to the accused by the complainant in 1997 and 1998 (Exhibit 7a and 7b), and other cards given or sent to CY and the accused (Exhibits 8a and 8c, Exhibits 3a-k), contradicted the evidence given by the complainant as to the character of the relationship that she had with the accused and her step-mother. 

29In relation to the verdicts by direction, the matter cannot be resolved adverse to the respondent simply on the basis that the complainant failed to give evidence of any event relevant to two of the counts. I accept the Crown's submission that it might reasonably have anticipated, given the terms of the complainant's statement, that the complainant would give evidence of those matters. But, as the authorities make clear, and as I have pointed out earlier, the matter cannot be examined solely from the perspective of determining whether it was reasonable to institute the proceedings having regard solely to what the complainant said either at trial or in statements. The Crown did not seek leave to ask the complainant to refresh her memory from her statement. The complainant had clearly forgotten the contents of her statement and/or those allegations completely when giving evidence. 

30Returning to the issue of the ""hole"" in the penis of the applicant, the Crown relied upon the complainant's evidence at trial and the additional evidence of PY's claim in his statement of seeing such a scar. So far as the trial of PY's allegations and his reliability, or lack of, I refer to my previous judgment of 20 December 2011. But those matters are not of critical importance here. The claim by PY, of seeing such a scar, does not materially support the complainant in this application. This is particularly so given that the prosecutor would have needed to consider the evidence at this trial that it was common knowledge, within the family, that the applicant had a ""scar"" or hole on his penis as a result of a tick burrowing into his penis when he was a child. The complainant's claim of seeing such a mark or scar was of little value if the presence of the scar was a matter of comment within the family. What transpired to be critical about the issue, in this trial, was that the complainant had indicated a position on the penis where the scar was to be located, which was not in the same position as the accused said it was located. Further, the prosecutor had to consider the fact that aided by information from the complainant, the scar, or hole, could not be found where she claimed it was upon forensic examination by the police under clear artificial light. The trial in respect of PY's allegations, conducted in 2011, proceeded on the basis that the scar could not be located by the police. Nothing changed at the subsequent trial. At that earlier trial the applicant did not give evidence. The Crown Prosecutor in this trial sought to assert that he could see the scar from the photographs that were taken in the forensic examination. That he could see something that the police could not see is debatable. In the end it mattered not, in this trial or for this application. The prosecutor cannot give evidence from the bar table. The prosecutor's claim did not answer the problem that the complainant's assertion as to the location of the scar did not accord with what the prosecution's independent physical evidence revealed, nor other evidence in the trial from the accused which was essentially unchallenged. 

31There is not one decisive 'relevant fact' or issue in this application that arises from the totality of material required to be considered, but a combination of matters, some, of course, self evidently more significant than others. Ultimately, no substantial evidence that independently supported the complainant was produced at trial, but there was much evidence to contradict her in respect of some counts on central issues (such as opportunity) and on collateral matters (such as the character of her relationship with him and CY at various times). This was not a matter to be considered by 'the prosecution' on all the 'relevant facts' as simply a ' word against word' case.

32Before the trial of PY in July 2011 I made findings in the ""separate trial"" judgment in respect of matters pertinent to whether allegations of other family members against the applicant (for which he has been subsequently acquitted) could reasonably be joined with this complainant's allegations for ""tendency"" or ""coincidence"" purposes at the commencement of the trial on allegations of PY, for which the applicant was acquitted. The reasonable possibility of collusion between the parties was a matter I discussed in that judgment. Ultimately, the findings in respect of that matter, insofar as it reflected upon the credibility this complainant, have not been addressed by the parties in this application and are irrelevant to its determination. 

Conclusion

33These were proceedings relating to offences punishable on indictment where the applicant, after a hearing on the merits was acquitted. I have concluded that a certificate ought be issued under the Act, because, if the prosecution, before the proceedings were instituted, had been in possession of all the relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings, primarily because the complainant's allegations against the accused and her evidence in other respects were substantially lacking in credibility. 

34No act or omission of the applicant contributed to, or might have contributed to, the institution or continuation of the proceedings. 

Order

35I grant a certificate pursuant to s 2 of the Act.

		19 March 2013",2013-02-21 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2707147,Reeves v R; R v Reeves [2013] NSWCCA 34,"Judgment

1BATHURST CJ: Mr Graeme Reeves (""the applicant"") was convicted and sentenced for four offences: obtaining a financial advantage by deception, maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent and two offences of aggravated indecent assault.

2On 1 July 2011, the applicant was sentenced by his Honour Judge Woods to a total term of three years and six months imprisonment with a non-parole period/fixed term component of two years. There is a Crown appeal against the asserted inadequacy of the sentences. That appeal is considered in the judgment of Hall J, where the details of the individual sentences appear. The applicant is presently due for release on parole on 31 May 2013.

3The applicant pleaded guilty on 8 February 2011 to the offence of obtaining a financial advantage by deception (an offence contrary to s 178BA of the Crimes Act 1900, as it then stood). On 10 March 2011, he was found guilty by a jury of the offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent (an offence contrary to s 33 of the Crimes Act). There was a further trial before Woods DCJ, sitting without a jury, in respect of five offences of aggravated indecent assault (offences contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act). His Honour returned verdicts of guilty for two counts and not guilty for the other counts on 14 April 2011.

Leave to appeal against conviction

4The applicant applies for leave to appeal against conviction for the grievous bodily harm and aggravated indecent assault offences. Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies in respect of the grievous bodily harm offence as the grounds of appeal concern directions to the jury to which no objection was taken at trial, although I note that the Crown declined to rely on this rule. The grounds of appeal in relation to the aggravated indecent assault offences do not involve ""a question of law alone"" and so leave is also required: s 5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (""the Act""). 

Background

5The offences for which the applicant was convicted all concerned events that occurred between December 2001 and July 2003, when he held an appointment as an obstetrician and gynaecologist at Bega and Pambula District Hospitals.

6The applicant had moved to the Bega area after suffering professional and personal problems while practicing as an obstetrician and gynaecologist in Sydney during the 1990s. The problems ultimately led to the Professional Standards Committee of the NSW Medical Board ordering in 1997 that the applicant ""cease the clinical practice of obstetrics"", although he was permitted to continue working as a gynaecologist on a conditional basis. The Committee's report found he was impaired by personality and relationship problems and depression, which impinged on his capacity to practice medicine.

7In sentencing the applicant the trial judge found that his situation had not improved following his move to Bega. He worked at the Bega and Pambula Hospitals in both gynaecology and obstetrics, despite the proscriptions imposed on him.

These judgments

8The following is my judgment in respect of the application for leave to appeal against conviction for the grievous bodily harm offence. The application for leave to appeal against conviction for the aggravated indecent assault offences is dealt with in the judgment of R A Hulme J. The Crown appeal against sentence is dealt with in the judgment of Hall J.

The grievous bodily harm offence

9The grievous bodily harm offence related to an operation performed upon Ms Carolyn De Waegeneire (""the complainant"") on 8 August 2002, which resulted in the removal of her genitalia, including her labia and clitoris. In the broadest terms, it was alleged by the Crown that the operation performed was unnecessary and done without the consent of the complainant.

10 The following grounds of appeal are raised:

""1 The trial miscarried because the jury was directed erroneously in relation to the issues of lawful excuse, consent and intention.

2 The trial miscarried because the trial judge directed the jury in terms which were appropriate to a civil suit for negligent failure to warn and advise but not to a criminal prosecution for an offence of violence.""

11Although the grounds of appeal are relatively narrow, it is convenient to set out in a little detail the course of the trial. This is because of the Crown's contention that even if there was a misdirection of the nature suggested there was no miscarriage of justice and the proviso in s 6(1) of the Act should lead to the dismissal of the appeal.

The course of the trial

(a) The Crown opening

12The Crown opened to the jury that on 24 June 2002 the complainant consulted her general practitioner, Dr Salisbury, and asked her to look at a white patch of skin on her vulva. Following a biopsy, Dr Salisbury told her that the pathology revealed a condition called Vulval Intraepithelial Neoplasia Grade 3 (""VIN 3""). The Crown told the jury that whilst Dr Salisbury said to the complainant it was a cancerous condition, the evidence from gynaecological cancer experts would be that it was in fact pre-cancerous. The Crown stated that Dr Salisbury referred the complainant to the applicant and that the complainant's evidence would be that the applicant suggested surgery to remove the lesion, that he drew a diagram for her to show the extent of the surgery and told her that it was a relatively minor procedure and only a small flap of skin would be removed. The Crown stated that her evidence would be that although she signed a consent form stating the operation was a simple vulvectomy, at no stage was she told what that was or that it involved taking other than a small flap of skin.

13The Crown stated that the complainant would give evidence that whilst she was lying on the operating table, just before she was rendered unconscious, the applicant came over to her and put his face quite close to hers and said quietly ""I'm going to take your clitoris too"".

14The Crown also opened to the effect that a Nurse Demmery, who was present at the operation, said to the applicant ""you wouldn't be taking my clitoris no matter what"", and the applicant replied ""It doesn't matter. Her husband's dead anyway"". The Crown stated that the operation which took place involved the removal of almost the whole of her genitalia including her labia majora, labia minora, her clitoris and her perineum. The Crown also stated that the evidence would demonstrate that pathology tests taken subsequent to the operation showed no invasive malignancy and that apart from the discrete lesion the rest of the vulva from all the samples looked at was unremarkable and normal.

15The Crown opened that expert medical evidence which would be led would demonstrate that the operation was quite unnecessary.

16The Crown Prosecutor summarised the Crown case in the following terms:

""It's the Crown's case that this did not have to be such a massively and permanently disfiguring operation. The accused didn't have Mrs De Waegenaire's consent to perform such a radical operation. She at no time was told of the amount of tissue that was to be taken and she was given to believe that it was a small lesion that it would simply be cut out. She was never told to expect the complete excision of her vulva. She was never told of any of the consequences sexually or in every day life from the complete loss of the structures of her genitalia. She didn't expect it. She didn't give her informed consent ... and the Crown of course contends that it was never necessary for the accused to perform the radical and disfiguring surgery in circumstances where there was only a small lesion and it was never conveyed to Mrs De Waegenaire that so much was going to - that this entire area of her body would be removed."" 

17The Crown also indicated during the course of the opening, that it would contend that notes prepared by the applicant, which recorded additional dystrophy or abnormality of the complainant's vulva were in fact fabricated to include the extra areas as an explanation as to why the applicant took so much tissue from the complainant. The Crown said it would be contending that the notes were inconsistent with a letter to Dr Salisbury written after the operation referring to only one area of VIN 3, the operation report filled out by the applicant after the operation and the pathology reports obtained after the operation.

(b) The defence case

18Counsel for the defence opened the applicant's case briefly. He stated that he expected the real issues in the case would be whether or not the Crown had established that the operation was not for the complainant's benefit and, perhaps more importantly, whether or not the Crown had proved the accused did not have an honest belief that it was necessary for her medical benefit.

19Having regard to the respective openings the principal issue on which the jury was being asked to focus was whether the applicant had an honest belief that the operation was necessary for the patient's welfare and whether the complainant had consented to an operation as extensive as the one which was in fact undertaken.

(c) The evidence led by the Crown at trial

20The complainant in chief gave evidence broadly consistent with the manner in which the case was opened by the Crown. She said that the applicant told her that he would excise the lesion and he drew a diagram saying it was a simple operation. She also stated the applicant said that the operation was a simple vulvectomy which was going to excise the lesion not explaining the meaning of the term simple vulvectomy.

21The complainant said that the applicant did not mention her clitoris nor discuss her capacity for orgasm following the surgery although he stated she could have intercourse after the scars healed up ""although it would feel different"" because ""she would be minus one flap of skin on one side"".

22The complainant denied that she was given a diagram showing the extent of the excision which was in fact performed. She denied that the applicant told her that she was a ""ticking time bomb"" or that she appeared to have ""some dystrophy possibly lichen sclerosus et atrophicus"".

23The complainant also gave evidence that immediately before she went under the anaesthetic the applicant leaned over to her and said ""I'm going to take your clitoris too"". She gave evidence that the applicant never mentioned taking her clitoris before and that she would never have walked in through the hospital door to start with had she been told that that was what was intended.

24The complainant acknowledged she did not complain to anyone about the extent of the operation, either to the hospital staff or to the applicant during the time she was an inpatient at the hospital, that she subsequently visited the applicant to have her stitches removed and that she first complained to the police in April 2008.

25Nurse Demmery gave evidence that during the course of the operation she noticed what she thought was a large piece of tissue being removed and commented to the applicant that it was fairly radical to which he replied ""Yes if I didn't take that much the cancer would spread"". She also gave evidence that when she said to him ""you wouldn't be taking my clitoris no matter what"", he said the patient's husband was dead so it did not matter anyway. 

26Dr Salisbury, the complainant's general practitioner, gave evidence that the applicant did not inform her, in his letter of 5 July 2002 reporting on the consultation, or at any other time, of any other area of disease on the complainant's vulva besides the VIN 3. She stated that she did not recall any signs of, or make any note of, dystrophy or of lichen sclerosus being present on examination.

27Two pathologists were called by the Crown, Dr Edwards who microscopically examined a specimen taken from the complainant by the applicant and concluded there was no other abnormality of the specimen apart from the VIN 3, including the clitoris. Nor, he concluded, was there any lichen sclerosus. The other pathologist, Dr Jain, reached the following conclusion:

""There was high grade dysplasia or high grade abnormality in the vulva skin which was completed excised... the cells had not transgressed the basement membrane or the junction between the first layer and the second layer - it had not gone into the second layer, so it is not an invasive malignancy.""

He also noted that the remaining vulva was unremarkable; that means it showed no abnormalities. He stated he saw no evidence of lichen sclerosus.

28Three gynaecological oncologists, Dr Davy, Dr Dalrymple and Professor Hacker, gave evidence that the extensive surgery performed was not appropriate for the presentation of a single lesion. Two practising gynaecologists, Dr Pesce and Professor Korda, gave evidence to the effect that efforts were made to preserve the clitoris and if it had to be removed the implications would need to be discussed with the patient. Each of these doctors indicated that they believed the surgery was excessive. Professor Hacker acknowledged that if there was genuine multifocal disease he would not have been too critical of the operation. He stated that one would still ideally try to preserve the clitoris but that was more problematic if there was a significant multifocal disease. He acknowledged that in an earlier trial he had given evidence to the effect that if a patient in fact had lichen sclerosus it might be something to consider, but there was no evidence that the complainant had it.

29This relatively brief summary of the Crown case indicates that the focus of the evidence led was directed to the issues of consent, whether the operation was necessary for the patient's welfare and the applicant's honest belief in such.

(d) The evidence of the applicant

30The applicant did not give evidence at the trial but his evidence at a previous trial on the same issues was tendered by consent.

31In his evidence in chief at that trial he said that after taking a history from the complainant he conducted a thorough examination of the complainant using his colposcope as a vulvoscope. He said that the complainant's vulva, without magnification, showed changes of quite a degree of thinning and reddening in the vulval area which is equivalent to dystrophy. He pointed out that he labelled it DYS in his notes, which he said meant dystrophic. He explained that meant abnormal growth or appearance. He stated it was also known as lichen sclerosus et atrophicus, which is sinister when localised on the vulva, as in combination with VIN 3 it made it more likely that invasive cancer would occur later on. 

32The applicant stated that he explained to the complainant with the aid of two diagrams that what he saw was pre-cancerous and that she did not have any signs of invasion at the time. He said he explained what was involved in the operation, indicating that both the labia minora and the majora would be removed. He stated that after that explanation she indicated she did not want to travel to Sydney or Melbourne to have it treated and that she wanted it dealt with in one go. He said he told her that the only option was to do a simple vulvectomy to remove the dystrophic changes. 

33The applicant stated that the complainant took the diagram on which he had explained the operation with her when she left the consultation. For the purpose of his evidence he sought to reproduce the diagram which was tendered. He explained that the first part of the diagram showed a dotted line which was the area of excision and the second part showed the area closed indicating vertical and lateral extension. He said the purpose of the second drawing below the first (which he said was included in the diagram given to the complainant) was to give some indication of what her genitals would look like after the procedure. 

34The applicant stated that he believed at the time the complainant understood exactly what he told her of the procedure and that she also understood the diagrams and what they meant. He stated that there was no discussion about the excision of the clitoris but it was marked on the diagram. 

35The applicant stated that his belief was that the complainant understood what was implied by the term ""simple vulvectomy"" and that he never said to her that only a small flap of skin would be excised. He denied that he told the complainant shortly before she became unconscious that he was going to take her clitoris too. He also denied the conversation which Nurse Demmery said had occurred, although he said that he may have mentioned that her husband was dead.

36He stated that he believed that a simple vulvectomy was the appropriate treatment. He said he knew the condition of vulval dystrophy and dysplasia to be commonly multifocal, which he said meant that the conditions were in more than one site at one time and in more than one degree in one area. He said he knew that recurrence did not occur at the site of the local excision but tended to occur in other areas of the vulva, so he felt the optimal treatment was to remove as much abnormal epithetting or abnormal skin as he was safely able to do. He reiterated that he described the procedure to the complainant and drew a sketch of it, indicating what it was called and what it was going to do. He reiterated that although he did not specify the clitoris he did in fact draw it on the diagram and that it was within the dotted area.

37In cross-examination he denied the proposition that ""simple vulvectomy was not the treatment for anything today or in 2002"". He acknowledged that the pathology disclosed no lichen et sclerosus but stated that it did not follow that the complainant had no dystrophy, as dystrophy was a clinical appearance found on clinical examination by both the naked eye and magnification and indicates abnormal appearance.

38The applicant acknowledged that if the VIN 3 was localised it was possible simply to do a few wide local excisions.

39In cross-examination the applicant stated that he had told the complainant she had a dystrophic vulva and that the VIN 3 seemed to be localised. He agreed that patients would not know what a dystrophic vulva was and that he could not recall defining the term. He also agreed that a sizeable portion of the community do not use the term vulva when it comes to describing women's genitalia.

40The applicant denied that the pathology taken after the operation did not support the operation performed. He said the use of the pathology was to exclude much more sinister problems but it was a random exercise in sampling and you cannot be sure that the whole of the specimen was examined. He acknowledged that in his report to Dr Salisbury he should have referred to the areas of dystrophy which he claimed to have seen, but stated that he did not. He also made no mention of this in his operation report or on the consent form to the operation which was signed by the complainant.

41It was put to the applicant that when he came to know in 2005 that concerns had been raised about his surgery he added a bit more ""DYS"" in his notes in order to justify the surgery. He denied the proposition, asserting ""she had clinical features of a dystrophy on both sides of the vulva and VIN 3 on the left side"".

42The applicant acknowledged that he knew that the optimum treatment for a unifocal VIN 3 was a local excision, but stated that it was not the optimum treatment for a multifocal VIN 3. It was put to him again, and he denied, that his clinical notes were fabricated and he also rejected the proposition that he did not show the complainant a diagram. He stated that he told the complainant that he was going to remove the abnormal skin, that she had a dystrophic vulva and he was going to remove all the abnormal skin. He reiterated his view that the operation was appropriate. 

43In cross-examination the applicant initially agreed that excision of the clitoris would be a horrific prospect for any woman although he stated not for all women. He said when he drew the diagram for the complainant there was a discussion about intercourse and that he told her she would look different and it would feel different but intercourse would be possible. He acknowledged again that at no time did he mention removal of the clitoris to the complainant, although he said it was encompassed by the diagram. He said the fact that he did not mention the clitoris was a criticism he could not retract from. He said he did not discuss orgasm with her but accepted that it was not possible without a clitoris. He acknowledged that it was part of his role to talk about sexual function after any operation he might perform because it was an integral part of a human being's health.

44He accepted that he did not tell the complainant she would be grossly mutilated by the surgery.

45In cross-examination the applicant again denied the conversation alleged by the complainant to have taken place immediately prior to her succumbing to the anaesthetic. He also said that he could not recall the conversation alleged by Nurse Demmery. 

46Towards the conclusion of his cross-examination the applicant was asked whether he accepted that he had not obtained the complainant's informed consent. He stated that retrospectively from the testimony of the complainant it appeared that that was the case but prospectively he believed he had. 

47The applicant acknowledged that he did not explain to her that after surgery she would have difficulty with the process of urination and accepted that the loss of the vulva is a very difficult thing for women to incorporate into their self-image. He denied that he did not care about psychosexual problems the complainant may suffer as a result of the surgery or disruption to her sexual function.

48The cross-examination was lengthy and with respect somewhat repetitive. However it focused on the following issues:

(a) Whether the complainant gave her consent to the operation?

(b) In that context, whether the complainant received the diagrams which the applicant said explained the extent of the operation?

(c) Whether the conversations alleged to have taken place in the operating theatre occurred?

(d) Whether there was necessity for the extensive operation?

(e) In that context, whether the applicant believed that the complainant had lichen sclerosus and whether he made the entry ""DYS"" on his notes when he realised that complaints were being made about the operation.

(e) Closing address for the Crown

49In its final address, the Crown told the jury that it submitted that the applicant's claim of having detected widespread dystrophy over the complainant's vulva was wrong and that he had made up the diagnosis of dystrophy retrospectively to justify why he performed an operation which was grossly out of proportion to what he should have done. The Crown pointed to the admission by the applicant that he had not referred to a diagnosis of dystrophy to Dr Salisbury and observed that the consent form to the operation and the operation report did not refer to dystrophy. The Crown stated that the complainant suffered grievous bodily harm because the rest of the vulva was unremarkable - healthy.

50The Crown in its address relied on the complainant's evidence that there was no mention of taking the clitoris and her denial of the receipt of the diagram showing the clitoris being removed. She also referred to the evidence of Nurse Demmery and the evidence of the specialist gynaecologists that the surgery was inappropriate.

51The Crown also directed the jury to the accused's statement that he did not see anything abnormal about the clitoris and to his retrospective agreement that he did not get consent. The Crown referred to his evidence where he agreed that he did not indicate the difficulties in urination she would have after the operation and finally, to his acknowledgment, that he would not use a simple vulvectomy for VIN 3 unless there were other problems.

(f) Closing address for the defence

52Counsel for the applicant referred to the absence of any motive for the applicant to carry out an operation out of proportion to what was required. He stated there were two critical issues. First, whether the applicant had an honest belief that the complainant was consenting to the operation and, second, whether he had an honest belief that the operation was proper surgery for the patient's benefit. Reference was made to the notes stating that the applicant had observed dystrophy and the absolute consistency between what the applicant said in his notes and his evidence in earlier proceedings. 

53Reliance was placed on the diagram said to have been given to the complainant when the operation was explained to her. Reference was also made to the fact that the complainant made no complaint immediately after the operation.

54Counsel for the defence emphasised that the experts who gave evidence were not provided with evidence that the applicant had detected dystrophy. It was also pointed out that Professor Hacker had said that a simple vulvectomy might be something to consider if the complainant had lichen sclerosus and that three out of five experts were prepared to accept that in certain circumstances a simple vulvectomy was a reasonable option for a gynaecologist.

55In conclusion counsel for the defence said that the case for the accused was that the complainant gave her consent and that it was up to the Crown to prove the absence of consent beyond reasonable doubt and to disprove that the accused honestly believed that the operation was for her benefit.

(g) The written directions to the jury

56The written directions to the jury explained the elements of the offence charged in a manner which was uncontroversial and then proceeded to deal with what was described as the question of lawful cause or excuse. The written directions stated that it was for the Crown to prove that the accused had no lawful cause or excuse and that there would be lawful cause or excuse if the applicant performed a lawful surgical operation on the patient, honestly believing at the time:

(a) That he did so with her informed consent.

(b) That the operation was proper surgery for the patient's benefit.

57The direction continued in the following terms:

""There will not be 'lawful cause or excuse' for the surgery performed by the accused if the Crown proves beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not honestly believe at the time of the operation that the patient had given her informed consent to the full extent of the operation, including the removal of the labia and clitoris;

Furthermore there will not be 'lawful cause or excuse' if the Crown proves beyond reasonable doubt that at the time of the operation the accused did not honestly believe that the surgery (to the full extent he performed it, including removal of the labia and clitoris) was proper surgery for the patient's benefit.

What Does 'Informed Consent' Mean?

As a matter of law, any person has a right to his or her bodily integrity. In the context of this case, the law says that medical surgery cannot be performed on an adult person except with the voluntary and informed consent of the patient.

'Consent' means 'agreement'.

Consent may be in writing, or spoken, so long as it is voluntarily given.

To be valid, consent must be 'informed'. This means that the medical practitioner must at least explain to the patient the purpose of the operation, the part or parts of the body to be cut or removed, the possible major consequences of the operation, and any options or alternative treatments which may be reasonably available.

The explanation must be given at a time when the patient is conscious. If the patient is affected by drugs or anaesthesia, a purported consent at that time may be invalid if the patient cannot understand it.

An explanation given in merely technical medical language may also fail to lead to valid consent, because the patient does not understand it or is misled by it.

The purpose of the consent procedure is to inform the patient and to obtain the patient's agreement to what is performed. If the explanation is not communicated adequately, by clear writing and/or words, the meaning of which she can grasp, the patient may not understand the explanation, or a vital part of it. If so, it cannot be said that there is 'informed consent'.""

(h) The trial judge's summing-up

58The trial judge commenced his summing-up by reference to his written directions. He referred to the evidence from Professor Hacker and other witnesses that the excision of the clitoris in particular can have a severe psychosexual impact upon a person and that a proven mental or psychological trauma which is a direct result of this (the surgical removal) can be described in law as bodily harm or injury. He stated that it was not in dispute that the surgery was done by a registered doctor. He also stated it was not in dispute that the surgery was done with technical competence.

59The trial judge then dealt with lawful cause and excuse. He repeated twice what he said in his written directions and then proceeded to explain consent in the following terms:

""As a matter of law, any person has a right to his or her bodily integrity. In the context of this case, the law says that medical surgery cannot be performed on an adult person, except with voluntary and informed consent of the patient. 'Consent' means agreement. Consent may be in writing or spoken, so long as it is voluntarily given. To be valid, consent must be informed. This means that the medical practitioner must at least explain to the patient the purpose of the operation, the part or parts of the body to be cut or removed, the possible major consequences of the operation and any options or alternative treatments which may be reasonably available.

The explanation must be given at a time when the patient is conscious. If the patient is affected by drugs or anaesthesia, a purported consent at that time may be invalid if the patient cannot understand it. An explanation given in merely technical language, may also fail to lead to valid consent, because the patient does not understand it, or is misled by it. The purpose of the consent procedure is to inform the patient and to obtain the patient's agreement to what is proposed.

If the explanation is not communicated adequately by clear writing and/or words the meaning of which she can grasp, the patient may not understand the explanation or a vital part of it. If so, it cannot be said that there is informed consent.""

60The trial judge then proceeded to sum-up the evidence given at the trial in a manner which was uncontroversial.

61During the course of their deliberations the jury asked a question in the following terms:

""On page 6 of the Directions of Law a definition of informed consent is given. Are we to assume that this is the literal definition of informed consent by which the accused is to be judged for his actions relating to the operation he carried out in August 2002.""

The trial judge answered that question in the following terms:

""Now the answer to that question is yes. But when you read the material on page 6 relating to informed consent you should also bear in mind what is on page 5 under Lawful Cause or Excuse. That is to say the Crown must prove both the absence of informed consent from the perspective of the patient and as well it must rule out beyond reasonable doubt an honest belief by the accused that there was informed consent at the time of the operation. Is that clear? Let me take it a little further then.

If you go back to page 5 let me take you through that material again. Lawful Cause of Excuse. The accused cannot be found guilty in this trial on any charge unless you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had no lawful cause or excuse for what he did. The law says that doctors can have a lawful cause or excuse to perform surgical operations which might not [sic] otherwise be criminal acts if carried out by persons other than qualified doctors. An issue arises here as to whether the accused had as a medical practitioner a lawful cause or excuse. Now let me just explain there. The issue arises here because the accused has said in his evidence and through his counsel 'I honestly believed I was doing the right thing, if I have made a mistake about whether she consented it was an honest mistake'. So this issue arises as to whether there was a lawful cause or excuse. It is for the Crown to prove that the accused had no lawful cause or excuse towards the bottom of the page the second last paragraph is what we are dealing with here. There will not be lawful cause or excuse for the surgery performed by the accused if the Crown proves beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not honestly believe at the time of the operation that the patient had given her informed consent to the full extent of the operation including removal of the labia and clitoris. Now what appears on page 6 about informed consent is how you judge whether or not there was informed consent. But you read that in the light of the other directions about lawful cause or excuse.""

The applicant's submissions

62In his written submissions the applicant pointed to the fact that the Crown's case was that the surgery was unnecessary and that this was put in three different ways. He noted that the first way the Crown put its case was that the applicant was motivated by spite; the second was that the applicant did not honestly believe the surgery was necessary for the patient's benefit; and the third was that he did not have the informed consent of the complainant and did not honestly believe he had her informed consent. The applicant referred to the remarks on sentence of the trial judge which, it was said, rejected the first two bases. The trial judge stated that ""he [the applicant] failed in his important duty as a surgeon to discuss with the patient the full scope of what he intended to do"" and ""the sense in which he intended to inflict grievous bodily harm was that he performed the excessive operation knowing that he was doing so without proper informed consent to the removal of the labia and clitoris"".

63The applicant submitted that as the trial was conducted, the issue was reduced to a consideration of the nature of informed consent and a doctor's duty to inform the patient. He submitted that the jury was misdirected in a fundamental way, being directed in terms of the law of negligence. He submitted that the approach that was appropriate was clearly reflected by what was said by the High Court in Rogers v Whitaker (1992) 175 CLR 479 at 490:

""The consent necessary to negative the offence of battery is satisfied by the patient being advised in broad terms of the nature of the procedure to be performed.""

64The applicant submitted that the direction given was erroneous because it gave rise to the possibility that he would be convicted for failing to properly inform the complainant in accordance with common law duties under the law of negligence. He made five specific complaints:

(i) The introduction of the concept of informed consent was dangerous in the context of a criminal trial where the issue was whether a doctor performing surgery had lawful excuse to commit the act giving rise to the charge.

(ii) The jury was invited to judge whether the applicant had communicated adequately.

(iii) The jury was directed that if the applicant had not communicated adequately it cannot be said there was informed consent.

(iv) The jury was invited to make judgments as to what constituted ""major consequences"" of the operation and what ""alternative treatments"" were ""reasonably available"" in order to determine whether the complainant ought to have been informed of those things in the context of whether there was informed consent.

(v) The directions may have been appropriate in a civil action for negligence but they were not appropriate to a criminal trial for an offence of violence requiring proof of a specific intent.

65The applicant gave one example of the difficulty that he submitted emerged from the direction. He submitted that taking the definition of informed consent literally, the duty may have included explaining that a possible consequence of the operation was puddling of urine on urination and that a failure to so advise may have meant that informed consent was not provided and/or the applicant did not have an honest belief on that question. At the hearing senior counsel for the applicant submitted that having regard to the direction the jury was entitled to find that that was a possible major consequence of the operation and that the applicant had not advised her and therefore not obtained informed consent. Ultimately the applicant submitted that an appropriate direction would be in terms directed to the following propositions:


Consent and lawful excuse are established if the patient is advised in broad terms of the nature of the procedure to be performed.


However, if information is withheld in bad faith, the consent will be vitiated by fraud.

66At the hearing senior counsel for the applicant submitted that there was a real risk, having regard to the direction, that the applicant was convicted on the basis he was a bad doctor or a bad communicator. He acknowledged that there would be no complaint had the direction been that the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant was not told anything about the extent of the surgery to be performed and she did not consent to it. Senior counsel for the applicant submitted however that the Crown at the trial had put the consequences of the operation squarely in issue.

67Senior counsel for the applicant properly conceded that if the only explanation for the verdict of the jury was that the complainant did not consent to the operation which took place or that the applicant did not honestly believe that this was the case, then the appeal would fail. He submitted, however, that this was not the single issue before the jury, saying that in addition there was the question as to whether or not the complainant had lichen sclerosus, whether the applicant told her of his opinion in that respect and whether he warned her of the consequences to her sex life and the consequences concerning urination.

The Crown's submissions

68The Crown in its written submissions pointed to the fact that the judge emphasised the distinction between an action in negligence and a criminal prosecution. It pointed to the fact that informed consent is an inherent part of lawful excuse and it was necessary for directions to be given on that question. It submitted that the emphasis placed on the issue of informed consent inevitably meant giving some elucidation of that notion to the jury. The Crown contended the direction given was consistent with what the High Court in Rogers v Whitaker supra said was appropriate for the offence of battery. 

69Although the Crown did not seek to rely on r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules, it emphasised that no objection was taken to the direction in the court below and submitted that the appeal had the flavour of what was described in Darwiche v R [2011] NSWCCA 62 at [170] as an armchair appeal.

70In that context the Crown contended that the jury must have rejected the applicant's assertions relating to his explanation of the procedure to the complainant and must have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant did not have lawful excuse for his conduct. The Crown submitted that the remarks on sentence of the trial judge, to the extent he determined that lack of lawful excuse only arose because of the applicant's lack of honest belief that he had obtained informed consent, were erroneous.

71In these circumstances, the Crown submitted, that if there was a misdirection there was no miscarriage of justice and the proviso in s 6(1) of the Act should be applied.

Consideration - The directions

72There is little authority in this country as to the appropriate direction to be given to a jury on the issue of consent in what might be described as medical assault cases. However, as the applicant pointed out, in Rogers v Whitaker supra, the High Court drew a clear distinction between liability in a claim for negligence for failure to advise of risks inherent in a medical procedure and liability for the offence of battery.

73In Rogers v Whitaker, the High Court held that the law should recognise that a doctor has a duty to warn a patient of a material risk inherent in the proposed treatment; a risk being material if in the circumstances of the particular case a reasonable person, in the position of the patient, if warned of the risk, would be likely to attach significance to it, or if the medical practitioner is, or should be, reasonably aware that the particular patient, if warned of the risk, would be likely to attach significance to it: Rogers v Whitaker at 490.

74The High Court declined to adopt the approach suggested in Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee [1957] 1 WLR 582, to the effect that a medical practitioner is not negligent if he or she acts in accordance with the practice accepted by a responsible body of medical opinion and the extension of this principle to a failure to warn of risks by the majority of the House of Lords in Sidaway v Board of Governors of Bethlem Royal Hospital [1985] AC 871. However, the Court emphasised that its conclusions were not directed to the issue of whether or not a medical practitioner would be liable in trespass because of the absence of consent to a particular procedure. In that context the plurality made the following remarks:

""In this context, nothing is to be gained by reiterating the expressions used in American authorities, such as 'the patient's right of self-determination' or even the oft-used and somewhat amorphous phrase 'informed consent'. The right of self-determination is an expression which is, perhaps, suitable to cases where the issue is whether a person has agreed to the general surgical procedure or treatment, but is of little assistance in the balancing process that is involved in the determination of whether there has been a breach of the duty of disclosure. Likewise, the phrase 'informed consent' is apt to mislead as it suggests a test of the validity of a patient's consent. Moreover, consent is relevant to actions framed in trespass, not in negligence. Anglo-Australian law has rightly taken the view that an allegation that the risks inherent in a medical procedure have not been disclosed to the patient can only found an action in negligence and not in trespass; the consent necessary to negative the offence of battery is satisfied by the patient being advised in broad terms of the nature of the procedure to be performed. In Reibl v. Hughes the Supreme Court of Canada was cautious in its use of the term 'informed consent'."" [Citations omitted]

75In reaching this conclusion the Court cited the judgment of Bristow J in Chatterton v Gerson [1981] 1 QB 432 with apparent approval. In that case Bristow J stated the consent necessary to defend a claim in trespass in the following terms:

""In my judgment once the patient is informed in broad terms of the nature of the procedure which is intended, and gives her consent, that consent is real, and the cause of the action on which to base a claim for failure to go into risks and implications is negligence, not trespass.""

76In the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Sidaway [1984] 1 QB 493, each member of the Court adopted a similar approach (see at 511 per Donaldson MR, 515 per Dunn LJ and 518 per Browne-Wilkinson LJ. See also Freeman v Home Office [1984] 1 QB 524 at 537).

77The comments of their Lordships in each of these cases were consistent with what was said by the High Court in Rogers v Whitaker in the passage cited above.

78In Rogers v Whitaker the Court also cited with approval the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Reibl v Hughes [1980] 2 SCR 880. In that case the applicant at trial obtained damages in both battery and negligence for his surgeon's failure to advise him of the risk of paralysis following an operation. The applicant was ultimately successful on appeal but only on the issue of negligence.

79In the course of his judgment Laskin CJ, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, emphasised that the failure to disclose risks involved in a surgical procedure did not vitiate consent for the purpose of a claim in trespass. His Lordship also warned of the dangers of the use of the term informed consent, making the following remarks:

""In my opinion, these findings do not justify the imposition of liability for battery. The popularization of the term 'informed consent' for what is, in essence, a duty of disclosure of certain risks of surgery or therapy appears to have had some influence in the retention of battery as a ground of liability, even in cases where there was express consent to such treatment and the surgeon or therapist did not go beyond that to which consent was given. It would be better to abandon the term when it tends to confuse battery and negligence."" (at [9])

80His Lordship also suggested that actions in battery should be confined to cases where no consent to the procedure was given by the patient or where the consent was obtained by fraud or misrepresentation. In that context his Lordship stated the position as follows:

""The well-known statement of Cardozo J. in Schloendorff v. Society of New York Hospital, at pp. 129-30 and at p. 93 respectively, that 'every human being of adult years and sound mind has a right to determine what shall be done with his own body; and a surgeon who performs an operation without his patient's consent commits an assault, for which he is liable in damages' cannot be taken beyond the compass of its words to support an action of battery where there has been consent to the very surgical procedure carried out upon a patient but there has been a breach of the duty of disclosure of attendant risks. In my opinion, actions of battery in respect of surgical or other medical treatment should be confined to cases where surgery or treatment has been performed or given to which there has been no consent at all or where, emergency situations aside, surgery or treatment has been performed or given beyond that to which there was consent.

This standard would comprehend cases where there was misrepresentation of the surgery or treatment for which consent was elicited and a different surgical procedure or treatment was carried out."" (at [11]-[12])

And

""I can appreciate the temptation to say that the genuineness of consent to medical treatment depends on proper disclosure of the risks which it entails, but in my view, unless there has been misrepresentation or fraud to secure consent to the treatment, a failure to disclose the attendant risks, however serious, should go to negligence rather than to battery. Although such a failure relates to an informed choice of submitting to or refusing recommended and appropriate treatment, it arises as the breach of an anterior duty of due care, comparable in legal obligation to the duty of due care in carrying out the particular treatment to which the patient has consented. It is not a test of the validity of the consent."" (at [13])

81These cases, in my opinion, make it clear that a failure to explain to a patient the possible risks involved in a procedure, however material, will not lead to the conclusion of an absence of consent for the purpose of criminal proceedings or the tort of trespass.

82It should be accepted that consent requires more than mere formalistic acquiescence to the proposed medical procedure. In order for a patient to be taken to have consented they must have been informed, in broad terms, of the nature of the procedure, in terms which they have understood: Mulloy v Hop Sang [1935] 1 WWR 714 at [1]. Merely having the patient sign a consent form for example, is insufficient: Chatterton supra at 443. Further, it is uncontroversial that a patient's consent only extends to the medical procedure explained to them. This includes the physical act to be undertaken and the extent of interference with the body proposed. If some other medical procedure other than that agreed to is performed, or the treatment or procedure goes beyond what is consented to, then there has been no relevant consent: Chatterton supra at 443; Mulloy v Hop Sang supra at [2]; Winn v Alexander [1940] O.W.N. 238; Reibl v Hughes supra at [11]-[12].

83The reasoning in Rogers v Whitaker, Chatterton v Gerson and Reibl v Hughes has not, to my knowledge, been challenged in this country, the United Kingdom or Canada. In Appleton v Garrett [1996] PIQR P1, Dyson J, as his Lordship then was, quoted with approval the judgment of Bristow J in Chatterton v Gerson supra, endorsing the proposition that once a plaintiff is informed in broad terms of the nature of the procedure which is intended and gives her consent, the consent is real unless information is withheld in bad faith or the consent is vitiated by fraud ([1996] PIQR P1 at 3). His Lordship did not elaborate what he meant by withholding information in bad faith but his remarks were made in the context of a factual finding that the defendant dentist deliberately withheld information from his patients that the treatment he proposed was unnecessary because he knew they would not have consented had they known the true position. In that context, irrespective of the issue of consent, criminal liability would arise because the Crown would be able to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the dentist did not honestly believe that the operation was proper surgery for the patient's benefit.

84In McDonald v Ludwig [2007] QSC 28, Muir J, whilst citing the passage in Rogers v Whitaker supra to which I have referred, held that consent to a procedure for a specific purpose did not operate as a consent to perform the same or similar acts for a different or unrelated purpose (see [2007] QSC 28 at [88]). It is not necessary in the present case to consider whether that statement is correct in the context of criminal proceedings. 

85Once it is accepted that consent is not vitiated by a failure to disclose risks inherent in the procedure it follows in my view that a failure to explain alternative treatments would not operate to vitiate consent. That is because decisions as to which treatment option is most appropriate are generally based on a consideration and weighing of the relative risks of alternative treatments. Further, a doctor's obligation to choose between alternative treatments is fundamentally bound up with a medical practitioner's professional duty of treatment and diagnosis. It is quite distinct from the obligation to provide information, to which the question of consent relates: Richards v Rahilly [2005] NSWSC 352 at [223]-[235]; Eagle v Prosser [1999] NSWCA 166. Whether or not such a failure could amount to a breach of a duty of care such as to give rise to a liability in negligence (see Eagle v Prosser supra at [36]-[38]; Richards v Rahilly supra at [230]-[231]), such a failure would not vitiate consent for the purpose of criminal liability.

86In these circumstances, any direction to the jury on this issue should be to the effect that the accused will not be guilty of assault unless the Crown proves beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant has not consented to the nature and extent of the procedure and that the doctor does not honestly believe that she has so consented. The only exception is where consent is vitiated by fraud or misrepresentation. Expressions such as ""informed consent"" or ""real consent"" should be avoided as, in my opinion, they tend to obscure the difference between criminal and civil liability in this area.

87In the present case it is not necessary to decide the difficult question whether consent to the nature of the procedure can be given in circumstances where the patient is not aware of the inevitable consequences of the procedure as distinct from potential risks associated with it. (See Somerville ""Structuring the Issues in Informed Consent"" (1981) 26 McGill LJ 740.) In many cases such consequences will be readily apparent but there will be cases where they are not. As no argument was directed to this issue, it is unnecessary to express any view on it.

88It follows, in my opinion, that the trial judge misdirected the jury both in his written directions, orally and in answering the question posed by the jury in the course of their deliberations. I have set out the directions earlier in this judgment (see pars [56]-[61] above). The initial part of the direction, namely ""there will not be lawful cause or excuse for the surgery performed by the accused if the Crown proves beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not honestly believe at the time of the operation that the patient had given her informed consent to the full extent of the operation including removal of the labia and clitoris"", may not have constituted a misdirection although the word ""informed"" tends to obscure the issue. However, the reference in the definition of informed consent to the requirement of an explanation of the possible major consequences of the operation and of any options of alternative treatment which may be reasonably available potentially had the consequence that the jury could convict on the basis that, although the complainant was informed of the nature of the operation, she was not informed of the risks or alternative treatment and that in those circumstances the Crown had established beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant did not honestly believe he had obtained the complainant's consent. The same difficulty arises with the oral direction and the answer to the question asked by the jury.

89It follows that unless this is an appropriate case for the operation of the proviso, there should be a retrial.

Consideration - The operation of the proviso

90The operation of the proviso in s 6(1) of the Act can only lead to the dismissal of the appeal if the Court is satisfied that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. As was pointed out by the High Court in Weiss v The Queen [2005] HCA 81; (2005) 224 CLR 300 at [43]-[44] and in subsequent cases, there is no universal description or criteria for determining what constitutes a miscarriage of justice: see also Gassy v The Queen [2008] HCA 18; (2008) 236 CLR 293 at [17]. However, as was also pointed out in Weiss, it is a necessary but not necessarily a sufficient condition that the Court is persuaded that the evidence properly admitted at trial proves the accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt: see Weiss supra at [44]. See also Baiada Poultry Pty Limited v The Queen [2012] HCA 14; (2012) 86 ALJR 459 at [27]-[29]; Cesan v The Queen [2008] HCA 52; (2008) 236 CLR 358 at [124]; AK v Western Australia [2008] HCA 8; (2008) 232 CLR 438 at [53]; Evans v The Queen [2007] HCA 59; (2007) 235 CLR 521 at [41]-[42]; Cooper v The Queen [2012] HCA 50 at [20]-[21]. 

91In considering whether the evidence proves the guilt of the applicant beyond reasonable doubt, the Court proceeds on the same basis as when it is invited to set aside a jury verdict on the grounds that it is unreasonable. The Court must make its own assessment of the evidence and determine, making due allowance for the limitations that exist in the case of an appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record, whether the accused was proved beyond reasonable doubt to be guilty of the offence charged: Weiss supra at [41]; Darkan v The Queen [2006] HCA 34; (2006) 227 CLR 373 at [84].

92In the present case I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty of the offence charged. There is no doubt he performed the operation which resulted in the removal of the complainant's genitalia including her labia and clitoris. Consistently with what appears to be the basis of the remarks of the sentencing judge, I am prepared to assume that the Crown failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant did not honestly believe that the surgery was proper surgery for the patient's benefit. That only leaves the question of whether the Crown failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant honestly believed that the complainant consented to an operation involving the removal of her labia and clitoris. 

93I am satisfied, taking into account the limitations in dealing with the matter on the record, that the applicant did not have such an honest belief. First, there is the evidence of the complainant to which I have referred, to the effect that she did not consent to the operation which was performed upon her and in particular she did not consent to the removal of her labia and clitoris. As pointed out above (see par [20]) her evidence was that he told her that he would excise the lesion. Her evidence of the remark made to her by the applicant immediately prior to the operation, ""I'm going to take your clitoris too"" (see par [23] above) is consistent with the complainant not previously having been told of that fact. If this evidence is accepted, there is no basis for concluding that the applicant had an honest belief that there was consent to the operation. 

94The applicant acknowledged that he did not tell her at any time that he was going to remove her clitoris, although he insisted it was marked on the diagram which he gave her (see pars [36], [43] above). The complainant denied receipt of the diagram.

95Importantly, the applicant acknowledged in his evidence that the appropriate treatment for unifocal VIN 3 was a local excision (see pars [38], [42] above). His justification for the operation was that on examining the complainant he had detected dystrophy or lichen sclerosus. If this was in fact the condition observed by him, it was, both on his own evidence and on the evidence of Professor Hacker, a serious matter and it is inconceivable that it would not have been reflected in the applicant's report to the complainant's general practitioner, in his operation notes, or on the consent form he caused the complainant to sign. However, there was no reference to it on any of these documents. Further, the pathology reports provided no evidence of the condition. 

96The only evidence to the contrary is a note ""DYS"" on notes produced by the applicant. Having regard to the other evidence to which I have referred, I am satisfied that that is not what the applicant observed on examination.

97Once it is concluded that the applicant was untruthful in stating the extent of the disease he observed in examination, there is no reason to doubt the complainant's evidence as to the explanation she was given and her denial of receipt of a diagram showing the extent of the operation which was performed. The explanation of the extent of the operation given to her was consistent with what on the evidence was necessary for an operation on a person with her condition. Even if it is accepted that the Crown had failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant did not have an honest belief as to the necessity of the operation, that is no reason in the circumstances of this case to doubt the complainant's version of what she had been told or her denial of the receipt of a diagram showing the extent of the operation. In those circumstances I am satisfied to the requisite standard that the applicant did not have an honest belief that the complainant had consented to the nature and extent of the operation.

98I am conscious in reaching this conclusion that the complainant did not complain for a considerable period after the time of her operation, her first complaint to the police being in April 2008. She admitted she could have complained earlier. Whilst this is of course relevant in considering the complainant's evidence, it does not cause me to alter the view I have expressed above particularly having regard to the objective evidence of the report to the general practitioner, the operation notes and the absence of any reason for the operation as evidenced by the pathology reports.

99In these circumstances I am persuaded that the evidence led at the trial proved the offence beyond reasonable doubt.

100Nor am I of the view that the direction resulted in the applicant being deprived of a real chance of acquittal. Although the Crown declined to rely on r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules it is of significance that no objection was taken to the direction by experienced counsel at the trial: See Gately v The Queen [2007] HCA 55; (2007) 232 CLR 208 at [77].

101The applicant's submission on this issue is summarised in par [64] above. In summary it was submitted that the jury could have convicted on what was essentially inadequate communication, or on the basis that informed consent was not given in circumstances where the complainant was not informed of alternative treatment or the risks involved in the operation.

102I do not believe that this is correct. Having regard to the way the case was conducted and the opening and closing addresses, what was clearly put in issue on the question of consent was whether the complainant had consented to the procedure undertaken rather than a relatively minor surgical procedure. The evidence given by experts as to the appropriate treatment was not directed to alternative treatments which may have been available and discussed, but rather to whether the applicant could have believed the operation was for the benefit of the complainant. There was some limited cross-examination on possible consequences and there was a reference in the closing address of the Crown to the fact that the complainant was not told of the difficulty she may have in urination subsequent to the operation, but it does not seem to me that that cross-examination or that reference would lead to a real likelihood that the jury convicted on the grounds that although the complainant was informed of the nature and extent of the operation, she was not informed that subsequent to it she would have difficulties in urination.

103Further, although in his answer to the question from the jury the trial judge reiterated his definition of informed consent, he did so by reference to the earlier part of his written direction and repeated that there would not be lawful cause or excuse for the surgery performed if the Crown proves beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not honestly believe at the time of the operation that the patient had given her informed consent to the full extent of the operation including removal of the labia and clitoris. The trial judge thus recognised the area which issue had been joined by the parties and directed the jury to that particular issue.

104In those circumstances, in my opinion, the applicant did not lose a reasonable chance of acquittal.

105Further, I do not consider that there was an error so fundamental that there is no room for the operation of the proviso. It is not a case where the trial was so flawed that this Court is deprived of the capacity of assessing whether or not the applicant may have lost a fair chance of acquittal: See Cesan supra at [81]; Nudd v The Queen [2006] HCA 9; (2006) 80 ALJR 614 at [6]. Nor are there any other circumstances in the present case which lead to the conclusion that there was such a departure from a fair trial according to law that it is inappropriate for that reason alone not to apply the proviso: Wilde v The Queen (1988) 164 CLR 365 at 373; Nudd supra at [6]; Darkan supra at [94].

106It follows, in my opinion, that in the circumstances of the present case leave to appeal should be granted, the proviso applied and the appeal against conviction dismissed.

The appeal against the convictions for aggravated indecent assault

107I agree with the conclusions of R A Hulme J on these appeals and his reasons for those conclusions.

Crown appeal against sentence

108I agree with the conclusions of Hall J and his reasons for those conclusions.

109HALL J: I agree with the reasons for judgment and the orders proposed by Bathurst CJ and R A Hulme J in relation to the applications for leave to appeal against conviction. The following is my judgment on the Crown appeal against the sentences imposed upon Mr Reeves who I will refer to as ""the respondent"".

110The Director of Public Prosecutions appeals to this Court pursuant to s 5D(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 in respect of sentences imposed by the Sydney District Court on 1 July 2011.

111The Director initially relied upon a Notice of Appeal filed on 18 July 2011.

112A second Notice of Appeal was filed on 6 October 2011 which was served upon the respondent on 7 October 2011.

113Particulars of the offences charged, the sentences imposed and the maximum penalties in respect of each of the offences were summarised in the Crown's Written Submissions as follows:






OFFENCE

SENTENCE IMPOSED

MAXIMUM PENALTY


(a)

Obtain benefit by deception from Southern Area Health Service (between 1.12.01-11.7.03). 
Section 178BA Crimes Act 1900

Imprisonment for 1 year commencing 1/6/11 and expiring 31/5/12.

5 years imprisonment


(b)

Aggravated indecent assaults (victim under the authority of the offender) x 2 (victims [CA] on 21.2.03 & [RF] on 2.5.03).
Section 61M Crimes Act 1900

Imprisonment for 18 months on each count, to be served concurrently, commencing 1/12/11 and expiring 31/5/13.

7 years, SNPP 5 years


(c)

Maliciously Inflict Grievous Bodily Harm with Intent (victim Carolyn De Waegeneire on 8.8.02).
Section 33 Crimes Act 1900 

Non parole period imprisonment for 1 year (expiring 31/5/13), with a parole period 1 year 6 months expiring 30/11/14.Eligible for release to parole on expiration of NPP. 

25 years, no SNPP

114The total effective sentence accordingly was a term of imprisonment of 3 years and 6 months, comprising a non-parole period of 2 years and a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months. Accordingly the respondent is eligible for release to parole on 31 May 2013.

115The respondent entered a guilty plea to the offence under s 178BA Crimes Act 1900 (""obtain benefit by deception""), was tried and convicted by a jury in respect of the offence under s 33 of the Crimes Act 1900 (""maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm"") and was convicted in a judge alone trial in respect of the two offences under s 61M of the Crimes Act 1900 (""aggravated indecent assault""). The Crown submissions summarised the position as follows:

""(1) The respondent pleaded guilty to the 'obtain benefit by deception' charge on 8 February 2011, such deception being that he represented that he was entitled to perform the clinical practice of obstetrics, and the advantage was the appointment to the position of VMO Obstetrician and Gynaecologist at Bega and Pambula District Hospital;

(2) The respondent was convicted by a jury on the 'maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm' charge on 10 March 2011, being the medically unnecessary surgical removal of the patient's labia majora, labia minora, clitoris and perineum, of the patient referred to as Ms De Waegeneire on 8 August 2002; and

(3) The respondent was convicted by the trial judge, his Honour Woods DCJ, of the 'indecent assault' charges on 14 April 2011, each being the unnecessary touching of the clitoris of the patient during two separate medical examinations on 21 February 2003 and 2 May 2003.""

116The Director relied upon six grounds of appeal in the following terms:

""(1) His Honour erred in his characterisation of the grievous bodily harm offence and imposed a sentence that is manifestly inadequate.

(2) His Honour erred by failing to fix a non-parole period for each of the offences of aggravated indecent assault under authority contrary to s 61M(1) Crimes Act 1900 given a standard non-parole period has been prescribed.

(3) On each of the offences of aggravated indecent assault under authority contrary to s 61M(1) Crimes Act 1900, his Honour imposed a sentence that is manifestly inadequate.

(4) His Honour imposed a sentence for the obtain benefit by deception offence that is manifestly inadequate.

(5) His Honour erred by imposing sentences which were manifestly inadequate by reason of his undue emphasis on the Respondent's asserted depression.

(6) His Honour erred in failing to adequately accumulate the sentences, leading to a manifestly inadequate total sentence and manifestly inadequate total non-parole period.""

117In relation to ground (6) the Crown submitted that the way in which the sentencing judge structured the sentences itself manifests sentencing error. The effect of that error, it was contended, contributed to the manifest inadequacy of the total or aggregate sentence. 

118In its Written Submissions at [33], the Crown observed that the non-parole period fixed by the sentence imposed for the 'grievous bodily harm offence', namely a period of 12 months, was subsumed within the sentences imposed for the two indecent assault offences which themselves were concurrent with each other (commencing 1 December 2011 and expiring on 31 May 2013). The latter two offences, the Crown observed, were unrelated indecent assault offences. Finally, it was noted that a period of only 6 months was solely referrable to the 'obtain benefit by deception' offence: Crown Written Submissions at [34]. 

119I will shortly turn to consider each ground of appeal below.

Summary of Subjective Factors

120The learned sentencing judge referred to a number of subjective matters in the course of his sentencing remarks. They included the following evidence and findings:

The respondent was born in 1950. He excelled academically both at high school and at university, graduating with honours. His initial practice as a specialist in obstetrics and gynaecology was considerably successful. Up until the early 1990's he had done much valuable medical work, helping mothers and families in crises and had saved lives: ROS 23.

At some point in the early 1990's the respondent suffered a breakdown involving a major depressive illness. Dr Stella Dalton, his treating psychiatrist, referred to him experiencing a personality change which was apparent both at home and at work from the onset of the illness in 1991: ROS 22.

In 1997 the Professional Standards Committee of the NSW Medical Board (""PSC"") upheld a number of complaints about the respondent's work as an obstetrician and gynaecologist in the early 1990's. The complaints concerned both the quality of his work and the manner in which he communicated (or failed to communicate) with patients: ROS 3.

The PSC found not only unsatisfactory professional conduct but also that the respondent was ""impaired"" in his mental capacity to practice medicine by reason of personality and relationship problems, and depression: ROS 8

The PSC ordered that the respondent cease the clinical practice of obstetrics, whilst permitting him to continue to work as a gynaecologist under various conditions including working under supervision, continuing in psychiatric treatment and taking appropriate medication: ROS 9.

The respondent continued to consult his treating psychiatrist, Dr Stella Dalton. When he found his professional and family life in Sydney too difficult he moved to Bega and set up practice as a gynaecologist: ROS 9.

The evidence of the respondent's wife was that notwithstanding the move to Bega, the stress he was under in his working environment was just as bad, if not worse, than it had been in Sydney: ROS 12.

The respondent became beset by his own medical problems in the late 1990's. He experienced a urinary problem requiring emergency surgery which resulted in impotency. He was diagnosed with insulin dependant diabetes. He experienced some difficulty with his sight: ROS 12.

The respondent was forced into bankruptcy in 1999 and he separated from his wife, who was left with their children, around 1999 to 2000: ROS 23.

The respondent had shown no contrition for his misconduct: ROS 12.

He had no previous convictions. This would be his first prison sentence and would almost certainly be served wholly in isolation: ROS 24.

Ground 1
His Honour erred in his characterisation of the grievous bodily harm offence and imposed a sentence that is manifestly inadequate.

Findings on Sentence

121In accordance with authority it is the duty of a sentencing judge, following a guilty verdict by a jury at trial, to determine the facts relevant to sentencing. Some facts will have emerged in evidence at the trial whilst others may only emerge in the course of the sentencing proceedings: R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 at 377-378. In Cheung v The Queen (2001) 209 CLR 1 at 1011, the High Court (Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ), in relation to the verdict of a jury, observed:

""On occasion, this may mean that a jury's verdict on the black and white issue of guilt may leave to a sentencing judge a difficult task of deciding questions of degree involved in assessing the offender's culpability, and the proper measure of punishment. There are many cases involving a plea of guilty, or a conviction following a plea of not guilty, where the task of assessing the offender's culpability is more difficult than that of determining his or her guilt."" 

122The High Court in Cheung, supra at 1213, approved the summary of principles as stated by this Court in Isaacs, supra, that included:

""3. The primary constraint upon the power and duty of decision-making referred to above is that the view of the facts adopted by the judge for purposes of sentencing must be consistent with the verdict of the jury ...""

123The High Court then observed (at 14):

""... the required consistency is with the verdict, ie the decision of the jury upon the issue or issues joined for trial. It is at this point that the distinction between issues, facts relevant to an issue, and evidence, is important. Failure to observe that distinction is apt to cause confusion and error. If, as in the present case, a jury returns a general verdict upon a single count in an indictment, the resolution of issues which is expressed, or necessarily implied, in that verdict, is binding upon the sentencing judge. But the judge does not know the approach taken by the jury, or individual members of the jury, to particular facts relevant to the issues, or to the evidence of particular witnesses, except to the extent to which, by necessary implication, that is revealed by the verdict."" 

Submissions In Relation to the Section 33 Offence

(i) Crown Submissions

124In relation to the offence of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with intent under s 33 of the Crimes Act (the most serious of the offences with which the respondent was charged), the Crown submitted that the learned sentencing judge fell into error in the following respects:

(1) That the respondent was sentenced upon the basis that he did not deliberately intend to perform an unnecessary and unjustified operation, but believed wrongly, but honestly, that he should perform it. The Crown contended that this finding was inconsistent with the verdict of the jury (see below) with the result that the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence and the respondent's moral culpability was undertaken on an erroneous basis.

(2) That undue regard was given by the sentencing judge to the applicant's subjective case and the asserted mitigating effect of severe illness with the result that the sentence for the offence failed to reflect its objective seriousness.

125For the reasons shortly to be discussed, I do not consider the first of these two submissions should be accepted. The second submission should be accepted to the extent discussed below.

126In both the written and oral directions given at trial, the jury were told that in respect of the offence charged under s 33 of the Crimes Act there were five elements all of which the Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt before a guilty verdict could be returned. The constituent elements of the offence were identified as follows:

(1) On 8 August 2002 at Pambula in the state of New South Wales
(2) did maliciously
(3) inflict grievous bodily harm upon Caroline De Waegeneire
(4) with intent to do grievous bodily harm
(5) without lawful cause or excuse.

127The written directions given to the jury (p 5) entitled ""Lawful Cause or Excuse"" recorded the following:

""... there would be 'lawful cause or excuse' for what the accused did if, in his role as a medical practitioner, the accused performed a lawful surgical operation upon the patient, honestly believing at that time

(a) that he did so with her informed consent, and

(b) that the operation was proper surgery for the patient's benefit.

It will be obvious to you that most surgery performed by medical practitioners is perfectly legal. Normally it is done with the informed consent of the patient and in good faith for the benefit of the patient's health.

However in this case I direct you that:

There will not be 'lawful cause or excuse' for the surgery performed by the accused if the Crown proves beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not honestly believe at the time of the operation that the patient had given her informed consent to the full extent of the operation, including removal of the labia and clitoris;

Furthermore there will not be 'lawful cause or excuse' if the Crown proves beyond reasonable doubt that at the time of the operation the accused did not honestly believe that the surgery (to the full extent he performed it, including removal of the labia and the clitoris) was proper surgery for the patient's benefit."" (Emphasis added).

128After the jury retired, the jury sent a note asking for clarification of the definition of ""informed consent"".

129In responding to the note the trial judge reminded the jury of what was set out in the written directions including in particular what was stated at p 5 in relation to ""lawful cause or excuse"".

130The jury returned shortly thereafter and delivered their verdict of guilty.

131The sentencing judge observed:

""... there was extensive expert evidence before the court, undisputed save by the offender himself, that the very extensive surgery conducted was not necessary and should have been avoided. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender deliberately intended to perform an unnecessary and unjustified operation. It is possible he believed, wrongly but honestly, that he should perform the operation as he did in order to eradicate any possibility that the potential cancer could become malignant and invasive. The sense in which he intended to inflict grievous bodily harm was that he performed the excessive operation knowing that he was doing so without proper informed consent to the removal of the labia and clitoris."" Remarks on Sentence at 13-14. 

132The Crown submissions noted that the sentencing judge made findings as follows:

(1) That the respondent failed in his important duty as a surgeon to discuss with the patient (the complainant) the full scope of what he intended to do.

(2) There was extensive medical expert evidence (undisputed except by the respondent) that established that the very extensive surgery conducted was not necessary and should have been avoided.

(3) The medical evidence established that the extensive surgery undertaken was not appropriate surgical practice.

(4) The criminality of the respondent's conduct was: 

""... in the intentional performance of the operation to the extent that it was performed without the informed consent of the patient. This amounts to the intention to inflict grievous bodily harm."" ROS p 14. 

(5) That in the operating theatre and just before the complainant became unconscious from the anaesthetic, the respondent said to her ""I'm going to take your clitoris too."" The sentencing judge interpreted and concluded that these words indicated that at that point the respondent gave some passing thought to the issue of consent: ROS at p 15, rather than being evidence of malice (see paragraph [136] below).

(6) The respondent must, however, have been aware all along of the need for fully informed consent but that he ignored it: ROS at p 15.

(7) The complainant suffered grievous bodily harm both in the sense of ""really serious bodily injury"" but also in the sense that it caused her much emotional grief and continued to do so: ROS at p 16.

(8) The surgery undertaken had resulted in damage which had given rise to ongoing difficulties and discomfort.

(9) The surgery was ""grossly excessive"": ROS at p 16. The sentencing judge, however, observed that ""... the necessity for some surgery is undisputed."": ROS at p 16.

133The Crown acknowledged that it was a matter for the sentencing judge to form his own view of the facts so long as that view did not conflict with the jury's verdict: Savvas v The Queen (1995) 183 CLR 1 at 8. However, the Crown submitted that the sentencing judge made a finding that was not consistent with the verdict of the jury: 

""[47] Consistent with his Honour's directions (and in accordance with the law) and upon which no complaint was made, to convict, the jury has unanimously determined that the Crown had established beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not honestly believe that the surgery was proper surgery for the patient's benefit.

[48] His Honour, by sentencing on the effective basis that the respondent did not deliberately intend to perform the unnecessary and unjustified operation but believed wrongly but honestly, that he should perform the operation, characterised the respondent's acts as mere mistaken judgment. That is inconsistent with the verdict of the jury, with the result that the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence and the respondent's moral culpability was undertaken on an erroneous basis.""

134As noted above, the Crown submission was that the sentence imposed failed to reflect the objective seriousness of the offence (ground 5).

135The Crown submitted that, properly viewed, the offence was one of ""peculiar wickedness"", aggravated by the fact that it involved a significant breach of trust (not an element of the offence): Crown Written Submissions at [52]. It was additionally submitted that the offence was further aggravated by the fact that it resulted in substantial harm, over and above what would be involved in an offence contrary to s 33. This appeared to have been recognised by the sentencing judge (at ROS p 16) yet in the result, the Crown contended, this factor was not reflected in the sentence imposed.

136In relation to the words which the complainant said were spoken to her in the operating theatre ""I'm going to take your clitoris too"", the sentencing judge made a finding to the effect that those words were not to be considered to be evidence of malice but, as earlier noted, an indication that the respondent gave some passing thought to the issue of consent. The Crown observed, that the sentencing judge's determination in respect of those words completely ignored the fact that the respondent denied uttering them, the defence position being that there would be no point in trying to obtain consent from a drug affected person. The Crown contended:

""Those words were, it is submitted evidence of malice and the respondent's sinister attitude towards the complainant."" Crown Written Submissions at [53].

137Apart from the physical damage inflicted by the respondent, the Crown submissions gave emphasis to the psychological harm inflicted upon the complainant which included post-traumatic stress in response to the offence and excruciating pain suffered by her over several months following the procedure with continued problems urinating. The Crown further submitted:

""The respondent improperly and maliciously removed all the external genitalia of the victim without her consent, at a time when she was completely vulnerable and causing the complainant, his patient, substantial physical and emotional harm. Consistent with the jury verdict, that he did so, was not the result of any honest mistake."" Crown Written Submissions at [55].

138The Crown noted that the respondent had shown no contrition.

139The Crown also submitted, as earlier noted, that the manifest inadequacy in the sentence imposed also resulted from undue regard being given to the respondent's subjective case and, in particular, what was determined to have been the mitigating effects of severe mental illness. 

140Whilst the Crown acknowledged that the respondent may have suffered a depressive illness for which he had been medicated for many years, it submitted:

""... it was not the cause of this offending ..."": Crown Written Submissions at [56].

141The Crown contended that a sentence greater than one consisting of a non-parole period of 12 months with an additional term of 18 months was required to reflect the criminality in what was described as an objectively very serious offence of its kind.

142On the issue of manifest inadequacy the Crown submission was that by reason of the complete concurrency of the non-parole period of 12 months fixed for the offence under s 33 with the sentences imposed on the unrelated offences of aggravated acts of indecency, the respondent had not received an actual term of imprisonment that was referrable to the s 33 offence: Crown Written Submissions at [58].

(ii) Respondent's Submissions

143It was submitted for the respondent that the sentencing judge's opinion as to the objective criminality of the offence was properly balanced. It was noted:

(a) That whilst the surgery was ""grossly excessive"", there was an undisputed need for some surgery. The pre-cancerous lesion, if left untreated, might in due course have led to premature death. The sentencing judge noted that that risk was removed although ""at a great and damaging cost"": ROS at p 16.

(b) Whilst there was a dispute amongst the experts as to the extent of the excision required, no witness challenged the need for surgical excision to be carried out upon the victim's labia minora.

144It was submitted for the respondent that whilst the surgery that was conducted on the victim was ""gruesome in its description, and in its permanent physical implications"" it was not an unknown procedure: Respondent's Written Submissions at [35]. It was stated that although the appropriate treatment for the condition known as VIN 3 was outmoded by 2002, it had once been the surgery of choice. It was submitted that this would have played a significant part in the sentencing judge's finding that the respondent did not undertake the procedure maliciously, but rather, that he acted with an honest but mistaken belief that it was necessary: Respondent's Written Submissions at [35].

145It was submitted that it was pure conjecture as to what course would have followed had the victim been treated more conservatively and the VIN 3 condition recurred. It is not known whether more extensive surgery may have been required in the future.

146In the written submissions for the respondent, it was contended that the Crown had put its case in three different ways, namely:

(1) That it was suggested that the respondent was motivated by spite - that he did the surgery ""wickedly"" knowing the surgery was unnecessary and without the complainant's consent with the intent to cause her extensive harm, including the unnecessary removal of her clitoris: Respondent's Written Submissions at [18].

(2) That the respondent did not honestly believe that the surgery was necessary for the patient's benefit and that the procedure was outmoded and excessive given the medical condition that the patient presented with: at [19].

(3) That the respondent did not honestly believe that he performed the operation with the patient's ""informed consent"": at [20].

147The sentencing judge, it was observed, rejected the first two of these three bases and his Honour explained the basis on which he found the respondent guilty. The Respondent's Written Submissions at [21] then extracted a passage from pp 13-15 of the Remarks on Sentence which is in the following terms:

""Such extensive surgery had not previously been discussed with the patient. In consultation he had never used the word clitoris to her. He failed in his important duty as a surgeon to discuss with the patient the full scope of what he intended to do. The lady said in her evidence during the trial that if she had known in advance of the doctor's intention, she would have 'never have walked through that hospital door to start with, never.' This is entirely understandable. The clitoris is a critical part of the female sexual anatomy. There was extensive expert evidence before the court, undisputed save by the offender himself, that the very extensive surgery conducted was not necessary and should have been avoided. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender deliberately intended to perform an unnecessary and unjustified operation. It is possible he believed, wrongly but honestly, that he should perform the operation as he did in order to eradicate any possibility that the potential cancer could become malignant and invasive. The sense in which he intended to inflict grievous bodily harm was that he performed the excessive operation knowing that he was doing so without proper informed consent to the removal of the labia and clitoris."" (emphasis supplied by respondent)

148It was submitted for the respondent that this finding was consistent with the basis upon which the case was put to the jury: at [22].

149It was argued that the significance of the directions given to the jury on the element of maliciousness became clear when the jury asked the question in which clarification was sought upon the definition of informed consent and the trial judge answered it and repeated his direction as earlier given.

150The submission for the respondent was that on the basis of the directions given it was open to the jury to convict upon the basis that the respondent had not obtained the ""informed consent of the patient"" as that consent had been explained to them: Respondent's Written Submissions at [26]. 

151It was further argued that the sentencing judge appeared to have been influenced by the following matters:

(a) The lack of evidence of motive to harm the victim;

(b) The evidence tendered on sentence by the Crown in the form of findings made by the PSC following a complaint made in 1997. The complaint, it was argued, provided evidence of a previous failure to obtain written consent from the patient for a medical procedure and the criticism of the respondent's manner of communication with patients; and

(c) The evidence, as discussed in the submissions, concerning comments alleged to have been made by the respondent to the victim in the moments prior to surgery, and to Nurse Demmery during the course of it. It was submitted: 

""... this evidence, his Honour found indicated a last minute consideration as to the consent to the extent of the procedure (in circumstances where consent could not be lawfully given): ROS at p 4 and ROS at p 14.

152The submission in relation to the sentencing findings was that the content of the directions as to lack of consent, and the nature of the question that was put by the jury in the course of deliberations (MFI 17) together indicate that: 

""... these findings were open to his Honour and were consistent with the jury's verdict.""

153On the issue of consent, reliance was placed upon the respondent's evidence that he had given a diagram to the victim which explained the extent of the procedure, but which, the submissions noted, the complainant denied having received from him. It was acknowledged that the jury clearly accepted that the victim had not knowingly given her consent to the procedure despite her written and oral consent to undergoing a ""simple vulvectomy"". The sentencing judge accepted that the lack of consent was based on the failure by the respondent to explain what that description meant: Respondent's Written Submissions at [38].

154It was also submitted that 

""... the unique factual context of this case makes it difficult to determine where this case fits in any identifiable range of sentences imposed in other s 33 cases."": Respondent's Written Submissions at [39].

The respondent disputed that the ""substantial harm"" could be said to be over and above what would be involved in an offence contrary to that section, given that an offence under that section could include brain damage.

155In relation to subjective matters it was submitted that his Honour gave appropriate consideration to all relevant factors, including punishment, deterrence, denunciation and the protection of the community. 

156The sentencing judge had received evidence on the voir dire as to the vast array of media coverage that was claimed to have vilified and destroyed the reputation of the respondent. Evidence was given as to the impact that it had had upon him and his family. It was submitted that his Honour was entitled to consider the extent of media attention as a form of extra-curial punishment: Silvano v R [2008] NSWCCA 118; (2008) 184 A Crim R 593; Oudomvilay v R [2006] NSWCCA 275.

157Emphasis was given to the fact that the respondent is 60 years of age and had no prior criminal matters. In relation to the protection of the community it was noted that the respondent was deregistered in July 2004. He was charged on 10 September 2008 and held in custody until his release on bail on 9 October 2008. He had been prevented from practising medicine and all offences had taken place in the context of medical treatment. In those circumstances, it was said, there appeared very little likelihood of re-offending outside of the context of his original offending.

158It was submitted that the sentencing judge was entitled to take into account the hardship suffered by the respondent in custody, given his past period on remand, and his likely protective custody classification during his sentence. His mental health status had also appropriately been taken into account in determining the length of the overall sentence. 

159There was evidence before the sentencing judge that prior to sentence the respondent had been in custody for 31 days during which he was placed in isolation due to his depressive illness and his perceived suicide risk. 

160Reference was made to the JIRS statistics for offences under s 33 of the Crimes Act which showed that all offenders were dealt with by way of full-time custodial sentences, where a medium head sentence of 5 years was imposed (with an 80 per cent range falling between 30 months and 12 years). However, it was noted that all offenders within the seven cases to which the statistics related, other than the respondent, had previous offences upon their record.

161Finally it was submitted that offences under s 33 encompass a wide range of criminal behaviour. A table of sentences imposed for such offences was annexed to the written submissions for the respondent (Attachment ""B""). It was submitted that the offence committed by the respondent did not fit within any of the serious types of offences incorporated in the table. 

Consideration

162The offence with which the respondent was charged under s 33 of the Crimes Act 1900 was one brought under the section in the terms in which it was expressed prior to amendments thereto by the Crimes Amendment Act 2007. Prior to its amendment s 33 was in the following terms:

""33 Wounding etc with intent to do bodily harm or resist arrest

Whosoever: 

maliciously by any means wounds or inflicts grievous bodily harm upon any person, or 

maliciously shoots at, or in any manner attempts to discharge any kind of loaded arms at any person,

with intent in any such case to do grievous bodily harm to any person, or with intent to resist, or prevent, the lawful apprehension or detainer either of himself or herself or any other person, 

shall be liable to imprisonment for 25 years.""

163""Maliciously"" was defined in s 5 to mean 

""5 Maliciously 

'Maliciously' : Every act done of malice, whether against an individual or any corporate body or number of individuals, or done without malice but with indifference to human life or suffering, or with intent to injure some person or persons, or corporate body, in property or otherwise, and in any such case without lawful cause or excuse, or done recklessly or wantonly, shall be taken to have been done maliciously, within the meaning of this Act, and of every indictment and charge where malice is by law an ingredient in the crime.""

164The circumstances surrounding the offences charged under s 33 were unusual. Many, if not most, offences under that provision have involved violence, often in the context of a confrontation between offender and victim. The circumstances of the present case, involving a medical practitioner undertaking surgical treatment, requires particular attention to be given to the constituent elements of the offence in light of the relevant circumstances.

165It has been observed: 

""Surgery will usually lead to the infliction of grievous bodily harm, (that is 'really serious bodily harm'), and not merely actual bodily harm. Nonetheless surgery is necessary for the preservation of life and health. It is clear that surgery is lawful where it has been consented to and, further, is carried out by a qualified person in appropriate conditions and in a proper manner for legitimate medical purposes"": Gillies, Criminal Law, 4th ed (1997), Thomson Reuters p 289. 

166It has also been observed:

""Surgery or medical procedures usually involve the infliction of actual or even grievous bodily harm on the patient. Nonetheless, a patient or one lawfully authorised to consent on his or her behalf can lawfully consent to the infliction of actual or grievous bodily harm resulting from such procedures."" Waller & Williams, Criminal Law Text and Cases, 11th ed (2009) LexisNexis p 49.

167In R v Coleman (1990) 19 NSWLR 467, Hunt J (as his Honour then was) considered the provisions of s 5 of the Crimes Act as to ""malice"" in the context of a charge of maliciously inflict actual bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse. In relation to that provision, his Honour addressed categories of acts that are done with and without malice observing:

""... on the other hand, an act done with intent to injure some person (which is one of the alternatives within the category of acts done without malice) does not by itself amount to an act done maliciously within that definition. An act done without malice but with intent to injure some person falls within that definition only if it were also done without lawful cause or excuse. That additional element is to meet the obvious case of, for example, the surgeon who necessarily (and intentionally) causes injury during an operation."" At p 472. (Emphasis added)

168It was accordingly open to the jury to return a guilty verdict against the respondent if the evidence established:

(1) That the surgery involved the infliction of grievous bodily harm; and

(2) That the respondent deliberately, that is, intentionally, inflicted grievous bodily harm upon the complainant.

169It was not necessary, for the offence to be proved, for the Crown to also establish malice. Whilst there was a body of medical expert evidence that established that the operation was neither appropriate nor justifiable, there was evidence, which it was open to the jury to accept, that the respondent acted on a wrongful or misguided belief that the surgery undertaken by him was either necessary or justifiable. I have concluded that, on the evidence, the Crown case did not establish beyond reasonable doubt that the respondent acted with malice. It follows that the verdict of the jury is not to be taken as having been reached upon the basis of a finding of malicious intent.

170Plainly surgery can involve, and on the evidence in the present case did involve, the infliction of 'grievous bodily harm' meaning really serious bodily harm. The evidence also established, beyond reasonable doubt, that the respondent in undertaking surgery upon the complainant acted deliberately or intentionally in inflicting grievous bodily harm in the sense that the surgery undertaken necessarily produced that result. The evidence accordingly established, to the criminal standard, the specific intent to which s 33 was directed. Proof of both, grievous bodily harm and the specific intent to cause grievous bodily harm in circumstances where no proper consent had been given by the complainant to the respondent's knowledge, were sufficient to establish the commission of the offence charged under s 33. 

171It follows that ground 1, insofar as it asserts error in the sentencing judge's characterisation of the offence under s 33, should be rejected.

172Ground 1 also asserts generally that the sentence for the s 33 offence is manifestly inadequate.

Was the Sentence Imposed Manifestly Inadequate?

173In determining the sentence to be imposed, the sentencing judge was, in my opinion, required in the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence under s 33, to give appropriate weight to the following matters:


The radical and extensive nature of the surgery undertaken in circumstances in which the respondent knew that he did not have the consent of the complainant;

The extensive harm inflicted on the complainant in consequence of the surgery involving the removal effectively of all the external genitalia, including the labia majora, labia minora, clitoris and perineum; 

The associated physical and emotional suffering resulting from the unauthorised surgery; and

The respondent's action in undertaking the surgery in circumstances involving a significant breach of the trust relationship between himself, as a medical practitioner, and the complainant, as his patient. 

174The above matters, in my opinion, characterise the offence charged under s 33 as an objectively serious offence of a high order. The respondent did not, as he was bound to do, provide a clear explanation of the extensive and radical surgical procedure that he intended to carry out and did subsequently carry out. His failure to provide a proper explanation to the complainant, and his undertaking surgery without obtaining her consent, constituted a gross departure from accepted standards of surgical practice amounting to a grave offence.

175In assessing the objective seriousness of the offence the sentencing judge was required to proceed upon the basis that the jury's verdict implied that the respondent undertook the unauthorised surgery knowing that he did not have the complainant's consent to perform it.

176The evidence does not establish any significant mitigating factors. The sentencing judge had regard to observations made by the PSC in 1997 including the observations by Dr John Woodforde in 1996 as to the respondent's personality traits. As discussed above, only limited weight should have been given to the respondent's depression. Dr Dalton observed that in the period April 2002 and July 2004 the respondent's mood appeared stable and he had taken his medication (Zoloft 100Mg daily) on a regular basis. Dr Nielssen in his report of 14 June 2011 referred, inter alia, to the respondent's statement to him in the following terms:

""... he reported that he was receiving treatment for his depressive illness at the time of those offences with a standard dose of antidepressant medication, sertraline 100mg per day, and did not feel especially depressed at that time. He denied the existence of any connection between his psychiatric disorder and his alleged behaviour while working at Bega.""

177The sentencing judge addressed the question of the respondent's mental state in particular in relation to the issue as to whether he held the intention to perform a medically unjustified operation. Without referring to the history obtained by Dr Nielssen, his Honour stated:

""... given his stressed mental state in 2002, and his overconfidence, I am not satisfied to the criminal standard that in his own mind he intended to perform a medically unjustified operation. His judgment during this period was unsound and was affected by major depression. He was able to convince himself that he was always right. As I say, the criminality of his conduct lies in the intentional performance of the operation to the extent that it was performed without the informed consent of the patient."" ROS at p 14. (Emphasis added).

178I do not consider, for reasons earlier stated, that the evidence supported the proposition that the respondent's judgment in relation to the surgery undertaken by him on 8 August 2002 was affected by ""major depression"" in any direct causal sense.

179In addition to the respondent's depressive condition, a number of other factors have to be taken into account. These include the fact that the respondent, as at the date of the offence, was a first time offender. In addition, it is appropriate to bring into account his age (60 years as of the date of sentence) and that a term of imprisonment on a first offender of that age will weigh heavily upon him. In addition, the intensity of media scrutiny has impacted heavily upon the respondent's reputation.

180The respondent's deregistration as a medical practitioner in July 2004 in itself provided a safeguard for the protection of the community interest. 

Conclusion on the Sentence Imposed

181As has been observed by the High Court, what reveals manifest inadequacy of sentence involves a consideration of all the matters that are relevant to fixing the sentence which, of course, includes the circumstances of the offending and the personal circumstances of the offender. Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [60]. 

182In relation to the offence under s 33, I have concluded that the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge was manifestly inadequate. 

183This is not a case in which any specific error could be identified (as in the case where it can be demonstrated that a sentencing judge has acted upon wrong principle, allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect his or her decision, mistaken the facts or not taken into account some material considerations). In this appeal the Crown, in effect, contended that it was to be inferred from the result that there was a failure to properly exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the sentencing court.

184In Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] 202 CLR 321, Gleeson CJ and Hayne J stated at [6]:

""Manifest inadequacy of sentence, like manifest excess, is a conclusion. A sentence is, or is not, unreasonable or plainly unjust; inadequacy or excess is, or it is not, plainly apparent. It is a conclusion which does not depend upon attribution of identified specific error in the reasoning of the sentencing judge and which frequently does not admit of amplification except by stating the respect in which the sentence is inadequate or excessive. It may be inadequate or excessive ... because the sentence imposed is manifestly too long or too short. But to identify the type of error amounts to no more than the statement of the conclusion that has been reached. It is not a statement of reasons for arriving at the conclusion. A Court of Criminal Appeal is not obliged to employ any particular verbal formula so long as the substance of its conclusions and its reasons is made plain. The degree of elaboration that is appropriate or possible will vary from case to case."" 

See also Hili v The Queen, supra, at [59].

185I have taken into account Attachment B to the Submissions for the respondent entitled ""Sentences Imposed for s 33 Offences"". I consider that the sentences referred to in that attachment are of limited assistance, given the highly unusual nature of the offence and the circumstances giving rise to it.

186I have concluded that the sentence imposed, 2 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 1 year, is manifestly inadequate. A consideration of all matters relevant to determining sentence, in my opinion, establishes that an appropriate sentence for the s 33 offence is a period of imprisonment of 4 years comprising a non-parole period of 2 years and a balance of term of 2 years.

187The respondent should be re-sentenced on the basis of a finding of special circumstances given in particular the requirement to appropriately accumulate the sentences to be imposed.

Aggravated Indecent Assault

Ground 2
His Honour erred by failing to fix a non-parole period for each of the offences of aggravated indecent assault under authority contrary to s 61M(1) Crimes Act 1900 given a standard non-parole period has been prescribed.

Ground 3
On each of the offences of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M(1) Crimes Act 1900, his Honour imposed a sentence that is manifestly inadequate.

188The respondent appealed against the convictions in respect of offences of aggravated indecent assault entered against him. I have had the benefit of reading the reasons for judgment of R A Hulme J in draft. The Chief Justice and I agree and join in the orders proposed by his Honour dismissing the appeal in respect of the respondent's conviction for the aggravated indecent assault of CA but allowing the appeal in respect of the conviction for aggravated indecent assault of RF, quashing that conviction, and entering a verdict of acquittal.

189In relation to the offence concerning CA, the sentencing judge referred to his verdict and reasons in what had been a judge alone trial which reasons included in particular a finding that the length of time during which the contact with the clitoris occurred indicated that there was deliberate rubbing for the personal sexual satisfaction of the respondent.

190In his sentencing decision, his Honour stated:

""This is a serious offence, shocking to the female patient and apt to undermine the confidence of women generally in medical practitioners. Given the importance of Pap smears in contributing to female health, conduct such as this needs to be marked by a significant penalty. The offender has shown no contrition."" ROS at 18-19.

191His Honour later observed:

""Why the doctor should have offended in this fashion is ultimately inexplicable. However, my best interpretation is that it reflected the continuance or recurrence of the problems which caused his breakdown during the 1990's, major clinical depression and a personality disorder of some kind. It may also be that the impotence resulting from his urinary disorder in 1997 had some causal role in his rash behaviour in cases 1 and 2. It is impossible for me to determine this and legally unnecessary.""

192His Honour then turned to discuss in detail the subjective matters arising in respect of the aggravated indecent assaults. In that context his Honour referred to the evidence adduced including the reports of Drs Dalton and Nielssen (psychiatrists) (respectively Exhibits SB and SC).

Crown Submissions

193The Crown submissions were, understandably, directed to the sentences imposed in respect of both of the aggravated indecent assault convictions. Given the quashing of the conviction in respect of RF, I will refer to them as if they were directed only to the conviction in respect of CA.

194In relation to ground 2, the Crown referred to s 45(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which denies the discretion to not set a non-parole period in respect of offences for which there is prescribed a standard non-parole period. Aggravated indecent assault, contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act, is such an offence. The Crown submitted that for this reason alone the sentence could not stand: Crown Written Submissions at [61]-[62].

195The Crown referred to various passages in the sentencing remarks. These included findings by his Honour that CA was ""in a highly vulnerable position"" and that she trusted the respondent ""to perform his professional duties and to advise her about matters of which she had limited or no understanding"". 

196It was accepted that the judge had correctly identified the matters relevant to sentence for this offence but the Crown contended that there was a failure to reflect such matters in the assessment of sentence. It was contended that the respondent's conduct was ""grossly wrong, intolerable and deserving of denunciation"" and that it served to undermine public confidence in the trust that can be placed in those carrying out gynaecological procedures: Crown Written Submissions at [66].

197As in the case of the grievous bodily harm offence, it was the Crown submission that his Honour's assessment of sentence was diverted by undue regard being given to the respondent's subjective case and his finding that his depressive illness was causally connected (ground 5): Crown Written Submissions at [68].

198The Crown submitted before his Honour, and repeated the submission in this Court, that the offence fell at the top of the range of objective seriousness. It was also noted that no mitigation was available on account of a plea of guilty or contrition. Punishment, deterrence, denunciation and protection of the community were said to be ""central to the sentencing exercise"": Crown Written Submissions at [69]-[71].

199For the foregoing reasons, and mindful of the legislative guideposts of the maximum penalty of 7 years and the standard non-parole period of 5 years, the Crown submitted that the sentence was manifestly inadequate.

Respondent's submissions

200It was conceded that the sentencing judge was in error in imposing fixed terms in respect of the s 61M(1) offence against CA and that the respondent will need to be re-sentenced for that offence. However in relation to Ground 3, it was submitted that notwithstanding the error conceded under Ground 2, the period imposed in respect of the offence was not manifestly inadequate. Attachment C ""Aggravated Indecent Assault Offences"" to the Written Submissions for the respondent was relied upon for the submission that the sentence imposed was in the middle of the range.

201Significant factors affecting the criminality were said to be, firstly, that the touching of the genitalia was not accompanied by other sexual touching of any other part of the body or by comments of a sexual or threatening nature. Secondly, the period of time over which the touching took place was very brief. Thirdly, that whilst the nature of the doctor-patient relationship was significant in terms of breach of trust, it was not as great a breach as between an adult and a child or young person.

202It was further submitted that the sentencing judge was not in error in taking into account the respondent's mental state when considering the overall context in which the offences occurred.

203Reliance was placed on the JIRS statistics for the offence in question which showed that 65 per cent of all offenders were dealt with by way of full-time custodial sentence, where a medium head sentence of 3 years was imposed (within an 80 per cent range falling between 24 and 48 months).

Conclusion on the Sentence Imposed

204The offence contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 in this case was a serious offence. Research by counsel failed to reveal other sentencing cases of the kind in question, that is to say, of cases involving aggravated indecent assault in the course of a medical examination.

205There is a case concerning an unaggravated indecent assault (and sexual intercourse without consent and attempted sexual intercourse without consent): R v Balakrishnan Arvind, (NSWCCA, 8 March 1996, unreported). It involved a GP who sucked the breasts, digitally penetrated and then tried to force fellatio upon a patient. The sentences imposed are of no guidance. However, Grove J, Hunt CJ at CL and Barr AJ agreeing, observed that the gravity of the offences was magnified by the breach of trust which the patient reposed in her doctor. He added:

""The Court should enunciate that criminal interference with the bodies of persons seeking health care will be met with stern retribution. The present case exemplifies vulnerability of patients and taking advantage of that situation for self gratification attracts general and personal deterrent elements into appropriate sentence.""

206On consideration of all matters that were relevant to determining the sentence for the offence in question, including in particular the subjective circumstances and that the circumstances of aggravation arise from the doctor-patient relationship, I do not consider that the sentence imposed is manifestly inadequate. 

207Whilst the sentence may be considered to be a light sentence, I do not consider it to be so light as to constitute or reflect appellable error. It is clear that the sentencing judge did have regard to the relevant circumstances. On the question of specific deterrence the sentencing judge took into account, as his Honour was entitled to do, the fact that the respondent will not have future contact with patients, he having been deregistered as a medical practitioner. His Honour was also entitled to take into account the circumstances of the respondent's incarceration and that they are such as to impose an additional measure of hardship.

208I will resume the discussion of the sentence imposed for the offence under s 61M in respect of the victim CA and the related issue of concurrency and accumulation when considering the principle of totality in the context of ground 6 and the need to re-sentence as a consequence of ground 2.

Ground 4
His Honour imposed a sentence on the Benefit by Deception offence that is manifestly inadequate.

209The respondent entered a guilty plea to the charge on 8 February 2011. The facts relating to the offence were set out in an Agreed Statement of Facts, which became Exhibit S1 in the sentence proceedings.

210The facts therein set out may be summarised as follows:

(1) In 1997 the Health Care Complaints Commission investigated complaints of nine former patients of the respondent and on 11 June 1997 the PSC found the respondent guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct.

(2) As noted above, the PSC ordered that he immediately cease the clinical practice of obstetrics. It also placed a number of conditions on the respondent in relation to his practice as a gynaecologist.

(3) On 4 August 1997, the NSW Medical Board sent a letter to him advising that the order not to practise clinical obstetrics continued to apply subject to any order that may be made by the Medical Tribunal on a review application that lifted or varied the conditions.

(4) During 1997/1998, the respondent made two requests to have this order varied to permit him to assist with caesarean sections. On both occasions, the applications to vary the order were refused.

(5) At some time between December 2001 and January 2002, the respondent attended Bega Hospital enquiring as to the availability of work. That led in turn to an interview with the Deputy Director, Medical Services of the Southern Area Health Service (SAHS).

(6) On his initial interview he made no mention of the fact that he was restricted from practising obstetrics.

(7) The respondent was subsequently interviewed on 16 January 2002 by Dr Arthurson in which he was advised that a specialist was required to provide back-up to the local general practitioner obstetricians, rather than a specialist to take over the routine care of such patients. 

(8) The respondent stated that he had a major depressive illness and had been under treatment. He also disclosed that he had conditions placed on his medical registration. He did not state that he was prevented from practising obstetrics by order of the PSC.

(9) On 10 February 2002, he submitted a written application for a position as Visiting Medical Officer at the hospital. On each occasion, he indicated that he was applying for the position as ""Visiting Medical Officer, Gynaecologist"". No reference was made in his letter to the order made that prevented him from practising clinical obstetrics.

(10) On 2 April 2002, he was interviewed by the SAHS Medical and Dental Appointments Advisory Committee. He did not disclose the PSC order prohibiting him from practising clinical obstetrics.

(11) He was initially offered a temporary ""locum"" position for a VMO at Pambula Hospital. In a letter to him dated 10 April 2002 Dr Arthurson advised that his duties would be to provide ""on-call obstetric service for emergency Caesarean Sections ..."". The temporary appointment was from 10 to 13 April 2002.

(12) On 17 April 2002, he was advised that the Area Health Service Board had approved his appointment as the VMO Obstetrician and Gynaecologist at Bega and Pambula District Hospitals.
(13) In April 2002, he commenced providing services at Bega and Pambula District Hospitals as a VMO Obstetrician and Gynaecologist. In that position he engaged in the treatment of patients that fell within the field of obstetrics and gynaecology.

(14) On 12 April 2002, he called the NSW Medical Board and informed them that he had been appointed to the position of VMO Specialist Gynaecologist to the SAHS. He explained that obstetric services in the SAHS were the realm of accredited GP Obstetrics and he had explained that he would not be doing obstetrics.

(15) During his appointment the respondent undertook the following obstetric procedures:

(i) Participation in the caesarean section roster;

(ii) Acceptance of referrals from general practitioners seeking specialist advice about obstetric conditions; and

(iii) Undertaking the treatment of 36 patients, which included assisting in the management of a mid-trimester induction and labour, consulting on the management of complicated labour/deliveries and assisting in caesarean sections.

(16) During his appointment with SAHS (10 April 2002 to 13 April 2002, and 24 April 2002 to 11 July 2003) the respondent was remunerated as follows:


$44,720.82 for participating in the on-call roster;
$184,528.57 for services performed, $23,104.03 of which related to obstetric services performed.

211The charge against the respondent was that between 1 December 2001 and 11 July 2003 at Bega, he by a deception, namely by falsely representing that he was entitled to perform the clinical practice of obstetrics, dishonestly obtained for himself a financial advantage, namely an appointment as Visiting Medical Officer Obstetrician and Gynaecologist at Bega and Pambula District Hospitals.

212On November 2002, it became apparent to the Director of the NSW Medical Board that the respondent was practising in breach of the 1997 order of the PSC.

213The SAHS removed the respondent from the roster of obstetric services at Bega and Pambula Hospitals following which on 12 November 2002 the NSW Medical Board contacted him requiring clarification of his employment status.

214In a reply letter the respondent stated that in his initial interview with Dr Arthurson he had explained that he had a conditional registration and would not be practising obstetrics. He said he also had given a similar indication in his interview with the SAHS panel. 

215On the very evening of 13 November 2002 he went on to perform a caesarean section. Despite assurances to the NSW Medical Board and the SAHS, the respondent continued to provide obstetric services until 30 December 2002.

216On 10 January 2003, his appointment as VMO was suspended. An inquiry then took place under the Medical Practice Act 1992. In the course of the inquiry, he wrote a letter in which he stated 

""I wish to declare absolutely that there was no attempt at deception on my part in seeking this appointment."" 

217On 7 April 2003, the SAHS served notice on the respondent of the termination of his contract effective midnight 11 July 2003.

Crown Submissions

218The Crown submitted that the respondent maintained his deception by falsely representing that he was entitled to practise obstetrics and obtained a financial benefit throughout the period 1 December 2001 and 11 July 2003: Crown Written Submissions at [93]. The Crown submitted that there was no evidence that the cause of that offence was depression. In particular, it submitted, there was no evidence that he had maintained his dishonest deception by reason of any mental illness and that the motivation was clearly financial: Crown Written Submissions at [98]. The sentence, the Crown contended, should not have been so substantially reduced by reason of any mental illness.

Respondent's submissions

219It was submitted on the respondent's behalf that the makeup of the total ""benefit"" received by the respondent was a significant matter. The offence quantum included the total remuneration received from the SAHS during the period of the respondent's employment and included payment for ""bona fide"" gynaecological work that the respondent was properly qualified and registered to undertake. Such work was not the subject of restriction. Of the total payments received, $23,104.03 related to ""obstetric services performed"" and $44,720.82 to participating in the ""on-call roster"". It was submitted that only a very small portion of the funds referred to at [23] of the Facts Sheet concerned the obstetric procedures described at [22].

220It was contended that this was not, unlike many cases under s 178BA, one where the respondent obtained something for nothing and that the sentencing judge appeared to accept that proposition. Indeed, his Honour stated:

""The significance of that charge, it seems to me, lies not so much in the actual property obtained or money obtained as in the nature of the deception ... sort of like practising without a licence."" Proceedings on Sentence at p 39. 

221It was observed that there was no evidence that the respondent had undertaken the work other than competently. This case, it was submitted, was not one of greed even though the respondent had debts prior to moving to Bega. Further, it was said that there was no evidence of him using funds for a lavish lifestyle. 

222It was also submitted that mitigating factors apply to this count, as was the case with the offence charged under s 33 of the Crimes Act. These were said to be additional to the plea of guilty. The offence, it was observed, was a most unusual one of its kind and, dealt with in isolation, was unlikely to attract a custodial sentence at all: Respondent's Written Submissions at [70].

223Reference was made in the respondent's submissions to the JIRS statistics which showed that 67 per cent of all offenders dealt with in the District Court received full-time custodial sentences. Of the 46 offenders who had no prior record, a medium head sentence of 30 months was imposed. The medium non-parole imposed was 12 months for the offender with no prior convictions.

Conclusion on the Sentence Imposed

224The sentencing judge observed that the respondent had attempted to justify his conduct on some 

""confused medico-legal theory that he was obliged to act in emergencies. His testimony on this subject was disingenuous and was exposed under cross-examination. I do not accept it."": ROS at p 11.

225The sentencing judge went on to deal with what he referred to as ""context"" by which his Honour meant the period up to 2002 during which the respondent was an ""impaired"" practitioner. In that period when he was deceiving the hospital and medical authorities, the sentencing judge found he was under stress. This, the sentencing judge stated, ""...shows a failure of judgment akin to that remarked upon by the members of the 1997 Professional Standards Committee ..."": ROS at p 12.

226In his consideration of the offending, the sentencing judge stated that the three patients whose treatment gave rise to the convictions had been:

""... confronted by a doctor with major problems. His treatment of the three women was in each case reprehensible. The women told the truth. The respondent has shown no contrition for his misconduct"": ROS at p 12.

227The sentencing judge, however, did not otherwise make any specific findings in relation to the nature or level of criminality involved in the deception offence.

228The term of imprisonment of one year imposed on the respondent commenced on 1 June 2011 and expired on 31 May 2012. His Honour stated that no non-parole period was set, noting that other sentences were to be imposed. He noted that the commencement date for the sentence took into account time already served by the respondent in custody.

229I do not consider that his Honour sufficiently analysed the evidence concerning the offence nor formulated the necessary findings with a view to determining the objective seriousness of the offence. The evidence, including in particular the Agreed Facts (Exhibit S1), clearly established that the respondent set out on a deliberate deception over a period of time which was practised on both the Deputy Director, Medical Services of the SAHS and the NSW Medical Board and those in a supervisory position at Bega and Pambula District Hospitals.

230Although therefore the evidence plainly established such a serious level of deception carried out over a substantial period of time, his Honour failed to make necessary findings as to the objective seriousness of the offence. This it appears led his Honour to adopt a benevolent, if not excessively lenient, approach based upon the view that the respondent's deceptive conduct was more in the nature of a lapse in judgment:

""Not only did he continue to be under stress, he was deceiving the local hospital and medical authorities. This shows a failure of judgment akin to that remarked upon by the members of the 1997 Professional Standards Committee."" ROS at p 12.

231There is, in my opinion, much in the evidence that supports the following submission made on behalf of the Crown:

""... insufficient regard was had of the objective seriousness of this ongoing offence, and of the principles of deterrence, as well as undue weight being placed on the respondent's subjective case ... has contributed to the inadequacy manifest in the sentence imposed."": Crown Written Submissions at [79]. 

232The Crown maintained that neither a summary of facts in the Remarks On Sentence nor the sentence of 12 months 

""... reflects the careful and continued deception in which the respondent engaged with the Southern Area Health Service over a period of almost 2 years ..."": Crown Written Submissions at [75].

233I accept the Crown's submissions as to the significance of the following matters: 

(i) ""... the unique nature of the deception"": Crown Written Submissions at [77]. In that respect the submission was:

""... for not only was the respondent being remunerated for the very work he was prohibited from undertaking, his continued practice in obstetrics served to effect [sic] the potential risk to patients which had formed the basis of the disciplinary action in the first place, that is, the respondent, fully cognizant of the findings of the Professional Body, circumvented the result, and placed patients at risk for almost 2 years."": Crown Written Submissions at [77].

(ii) The fact that the respondent's actions and misrepresentations involving a deliberate course of conduct resulted in him being employed in performing the very procedures which the PSC had prohibited him from undertaking given, inter alia, that he was found to lack the adequate knowledge, skill, judgment and care: Crown Written Submissions at [76].

234I am satisfied that appellable error has been established in relation to the sentencing of the respondent for the ""obtain benefit by deception"" offence. The question remains as to whether or not the sentence imposed of 12 months was, having regard to all matters relevant to determining sentence, manifestly inadequate. 

235The amount of salary received as a result of the deception, being $23,104.93 in respect of obstetric services performed, is a matter to be taken into account in the context of the whole of the salary remuneration received ($299,249.39), along with the nature and circumstances of the deception and the unlawful opportunities which it thereby provided for the respondent. These matters all indicate, in my assessment, that the offence was a most serious one and that the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate. 

236I have concluded that an appropriate sentence for the offence was a term of imprisonment of 2 years. 

237The respondent is entitled to a discount for his guilty plea in respect of the ""to obtain benefit by deception"" offence. Whilst the sentencing judge did not refer to this, in my view the lateness of the plea can only lead to a reduction in the order of ten percent.

Ground 5:
His Honour erred by imposing sentences which were manifestly inadequate by reason of his undue emphasis on the respondent's asserted depression.

(a) Crown Submissions

238The Crown's submission in respect of each offence was that the sentencing process was predicated on the basis that the respondent was ""severely depressed."" The Crown's contention was to the effect that but for the undue emphasis upon the respondent's ""depressive illness"" the sentence on each offence would have been substantially greater: Crown Written Submissions at [80].

239The issue raised by this ground of appeal accordingly was primarily directed to the question as to whether the evidence established that the respondent's depressive condition materially affected his clinical judgment such that it could be found that it played a direct role in his offending behaviour.

240The Crown referred to Dr Dalton's report dated 14 June 2011, (Exhibit SB), in which Dr Dalton stated that from April 2002 until July 2004, the respondent attended upon her on a monthly basis and during that period his mood was stable, it being noted that he took his medication regularly. The Crown observed that the respondent's own evidence was that during this time he had gained insight in relation to the issues that had resulted in him being ""an impaired practitioner"". 

241In relation to Dr Nielssen's report dated 14 June 2011, the Crown contended that Dr Nielssen's opinion was that the respondent's outlook ""might"" affect other forms of clinical judgment. However, his observations fell short of any clear opinion that the respondent's depressive illness had in fact played an immediate or direct role in his offending behaviour. In this respect, the Crown referred to the decisions of this Court in R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 and Wilmot v R [2007] NSWCCA 278. 

242The Crown submitted that there was no evidence to support the sentencing judge's finding to the effect that the offending was caused by a depressive condition and that such a finding had not in fact been one that had been urged by defence counsel. 

243The Crown, in relation to the offence of grievous bodily harm, submitted that the finding that the respondent performed an unnecessary and unjustified operation as a result of mere honest but mistaken judgment and the finding that this had arisen as a consequence of his depressive condition was erroneous. I have earlier indicated that in relation to that offence, the jury's verdict did not preclude a finding that the respondent acted with an honest but mistaken judgment as to the extreme surgery undertaken by him.

244The Crown finally submitted that in respect of the grievous bodily harm offence, whilst the sentencing judge was entitled to have regard to depression with which he suffered as part of his subjective case (R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255), the sentence should not have been so substantially reduced by reason of any depressive illness: Crown Written Submissions at [93].

245In respect of the offence of aggravated indecent assault involving the victim CA, for reasons earlier stated, I do not consider that any error has been established in respect of the term of imprisonment of 18 months imposed in respect of that offence although error has been conceded in that a fixed term was imposed and accordingly the resentencing proposed below addresses the need for the respondent to be resentenced in order that that error be corrected.

246In respect of the offence of obtain a benefit by deception, the Crown submitted, as noted above, that there was no evidence that the cause of that offence was depression. Further it was submitted that there was no evidence that throughout that offence the respondent maintained his dishonest deception by reason of any mental illness. The motivation, it was contended, was clearly financial and the sentence should not have been so substantially reduced by reason of any depressive illness.

247In summary the submission was that a finding of a causal connection or link by the sentencing judge was not open on the evidence and this manifested sentencing error in respect of each offence resulting in sentences that were each manifestly inadequately. 

(b) Respondent's Submissions

248On behalf of the respondent it was submitted that the sentencing judge did not give undue emphasis to the respondent's ""asserted depression"" nor, it was contended, did his Honour err in finding a causal link between the respondent's offending behaviour and his mental state.

249The written submissions on behalf of the respondent referred to many of the decisions of this Court on the question of mental illness and in essence it was submitted that the approach taken by the sentencing judge in respect of the relevant offences was consistent with established principle.

250The submissions referred to evidence that establishes that the respondent had suffered a major depressive illness in the 1990's and that he had been diagnosed with such a condition from 1996 by Dr Dalton who had prescribed counselling and daily medication. Reference was also made to the 1997 PSC findings as well as the evidence of the respondent's wife.

251In terms of the impact of the depressive condition upon the respondent and his offending, it was submitted that the evidence established a causal link between the offending and his mental health condition. The evidence was that his depressive condition was operative, although being treated, when the respondent moved to Bega in 2002. Reliance was placed upon Dr Nielssen's comment that depression could affect ""other forms of clinical judgment"" and that this had been supported by evidence of Dr Dalton during the 1997 PSC hearing.

252It was submitted that the evidence as to the respondent's ""pattern of depressive behaviour"" was particularly evident in the treatment of Ms De Waegeneire.

253Reference was made to decisions of this Court which noted that psychological conditions, such as depression, may be taken into account in sentencing even though such conditions have not been found to be causative of the offending: TC v R [2009] NSWCCA 296; R v Benetiz [2006] NSWCCA 21; (2006) 160 A Crim R 166; R v Champion (1992) 64 A Crim R 244 and R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48.

254It was contended that the sentencing judge was not prevented from having regard to the respondent's psychiatric problems when evaluating the subjective circumstances at the time of offending.

Consideration 

255The evidence established that the respondent had, in the 1990's, exhibited both ""personality traits"" as well as symptoms of anxiety and depressive mood which in combination had impaired his judgment in the conduct of his medical practice. In 1997, the PSC made a finding that he was ""impaired"" by reason of his personality and relationship problems and depression and that this had detrimentally affected his mental capacity to practice medicine (Exhibit S6 p 41).

256The evidence of Dr Dalton was that the respondent, from April 2002 until July 2004 was treated, by way of medication (Zoloft) on a daily basis, and that in that period his mood appeared to be stable. It is to be observed that the report of Dr Dalton dated 14 June 2011 did not comment upon the existence of any particular symptoms or disabilities that impacted upon the respondent's capacity to conduct practice as a medical practitioner within the restrictions that had been imposed upon him. 

257The history provided by the respondent to Dr Nielssen included the fact that he had received treatment from Dr Dalton for depression, that he at first did not accept that he had been depressed but that after having received treatment he realised that he had been.

258The history provided by the respondent to Dr Nielssen including the discussion of the subject offences, does not refer to symptoms experienced by the respondent such as stress, anxiety or depression. The absence of any history upon those matters would provide a basis that explains why Dr Nielssen did not advance an opinion as to a link or a causal relationship between the respondent's depressive condition that had been treated by Dr Dalton and the offending behaviour. Dr Nielssen (p 6) referred to the observations made by the respondent's wife as to his depression within a period during which complaints had been made to the Medical Board. It was in that context that Dr Nielssen referred to the fact that severe depression results in a pervasively negative outlook and can have a significant effect on decision-making and personal judgment. 

259Dr Nielssen recorded in the ""Opinion"" section of his report that the respondent had denied committing the offences for which he had been convicted at trial, and reported that he had been receiving treatment for his depressive condition at the time of the offences with a standard dose of antidepressant medication 

""... and did not feel especially depressed at that time. He denied the existence of any connection between his psychiatric disorder and his alleged behaviour while working at Bega."" At p 6.

260The only point made by Dr Nielssen relevant to the respondent's offending was his statement to the effect that a depressive outlook might affect other forms of clinical judgment, as for example in providing a prognosis in relation to a form a malignancy. That statement was then followed by the observation:

""However, Dr Reeves maintained that his treatment decision in the case of Ms De Waegeneire was based on his clinical and research experience with the condition and was not affected by the presence of depressed mood.""

261In his Remarks on Sentence the sentencing judge stated:

""In relation to each of the four offences, the appropriate sentence would in each case have been substantially greater than this figure were it not for the significant mitigating effect of the severe mental illness by which I find he was affected at the time of each of the offences and other mitigating factors ..."" 

262I accept the submission made by the Crown that the statement of Dr Nielssen (that a depressive outlook could or might affect other forms of clinical judgment) fell short of any statement by way of medical opinion that the respondent's depressive illness had played an immediate or direct role in the offending behaviour: Crown Written Submissions at [82].

263The Crown accepted that it is only where a sentencing judge has proceeded on a material finding of fact which was not open on the evidence, or where the judge has, in some important matter, mistaken the facts, that this Court will review the fact finding of the sentencing judge. However, the Crown submitted:

""Here, ... there was no evidence to support his Honour's finding, the evidence is to the contrary. The finding made by his Honour was not urged by defence counsel as causal, and in any event, there was no proper foundation for his Honour's finding."": Crown Written Submissions at [86].

264The evidence does not, in my opinion, support the proposition that the respondent's depressive condition was directly causative or linked to the particular offences for which he was convicted. 

265There is evidence that the respondent did suffer from a depressive condition over a period of years commencing in 1996 and subsequently in the period between April 2002 to July 2004 and for which he was being medically treated in the period of the offences. His medical condition was a circumstance that the sentencing judge was entitled to regard as one of the relevant subjective circumstances. The evidence would support the conclusion that the respondent was affected by personal traits and depression that could have reduced the competent discharge of his professional duties. The medical evidence, however, did not address the issue as to whether the respondent's mental condition had caused his offending behaviour. The other evidence, including the evidence as to the matters that led to the decision of the PSC of the NSW Medical Board and the evidence given by the respondent's wife, did not provide sufficient support for the mental illness finding that was made by the sentencing judge extracted in [261] above. 

266I have concluded that the sentencing judge gave excessive weight to the respondent's chronic depressive condition, in particular, in relation to the issue of his culpability in respect of the offence of obtain benefit by deception (s 178BA of the Crimes Act 1900) and the offence of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with intent (s 33 Crimes Act 1900).

Ground 6
His Honour erred by failing to adequately accumulate the sentences, leading to a manifestly inadequate total sentence and manifestly inadequate total non-parole period.

267The Crown submitted that the sentence structure applied by the sentencing judge resulted in an aggregate sentence which failed to reflect the totality of the respondent's criminal activity: Crown Written Submissions at [100].

268Reference was made to the well known observations of Howie J in Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 at [27] to the following effect:

""... there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality.""

269Howie J also observed in that case:

""Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other.""

270It was submitted that the total sentence imposed and the non-parole period simply could not be said to reflect the total criminality of the respondent's four offences.

271The Crown's submission was, in effect, that the sentencing judge erred in a number of respects including the following:


Error in relying upon the fact that all offences occurred in one locale. To treat that fact as a common factor, it was contended, was contrary to authority: Cahyadi, supra, 


The fact that the sentence in respect of the s 33 offence was wholly subsumed by the sentences imposed on unrelated offences (the effect being that the respondent was to serve no non-parole period solely referrable to the s 33 offence). Crown Written Submissions at [102].

272The Crown submitted that the absorption of the non-parole period of the sentence relating to the offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm into the sentences imposed with respect to the other offences, amounted to a failure to acknowledge the harm that was done to each complainant as a separate victim: R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 219 at [38]. 

Respondent's submissions

273It was submitted for the respondent that in structuring the sentences the sentencing judge had given specific consideration to the principle of totality. Whilst it was conceded that the overall structure of the sentence reflects ""a high degree of concurrency"", concurrence of sentences in circumstances such as those that arose in the present case, was not unknown. In particular, it was noted, concurrent sentences are appropriate where the sentences have features in common: R v Hammoud (2000) 118 A Crim R 66 at [7] or are substantially contemporaneous and connected: R v Myers [2002] NSWCCA 162.

Consideration

274Whilst I propose that the sentences for the obtain benefit by deception and grievous bodily harm offences should be increased, and there is a need to resentence for the aggravated indecent assault offence because of the conceded success of ground 2, it is appropriate to deal briefly with the determination of this ground.

275I accept the Crown submission that under the sentences as they are presently formulated there is a manifestly inadequate reflection of the totality of the respondent's criminality. There was an inadequate period of custody (6 months) that was solely referrable to the obtain benefit by deception offence. It was an erroneous exercise of his Honour's discretion to impose completely concurrent sentences for two separate and distinct offences against s 61M(1) committed on different occasions against different women. Finally, and most significantly, it was erroneous to structure the sentences so that the non-parole period for the grievous bodily harm offence was entirely subsumed within the fixed term sentences imposed for the s 61M(1) offences.

276I am satisfied that the structure of the sentences was such that the total effective sentence was manifestly inadequate.

Re-sentencing

277I have earlier stated that the respondent should be re-sentenced on the basis of a finding of special circumstances, in particular, by reason of the need to appropriately accumulate the sentences to be imposed: at [187]. I note that there exist two other bases for such a finding which were expressly relied upon by the sentencing judge, namely (i) that the sentences of imprisonment under the sentence to be imposed on the respondent represented his first term of imprisonment, and (ii) the prospect that he would serve his term of imprisonment in isolation, which would represent a special hardship to him: The special circumstances finding will be reflected only in the last of the sentences to be imposed as there is no utility in making an adjustment to the earlier sentences (aside from the need for some rounding to achieve a practical result).

278To correct the error in relation to the sentence for the aggravated indecent assault offence identified under ground 2, I propose that the total term of imprisonment of 18 months be maintained but that a non-parole period within that term be set. This is not a case in which the fixed term was imposed with the intention that it represents what would otherwise have been the non-parole period of a sentence: see the discussion of this issue in Collier v R [2012] NSWCCA 213 at [52]-[62] per R A Hulme J.

279In determining the sentence for the offence of dishonestly obtain benefit by deception under s 178BA Crimes Act 1900, the respondent is entitled to a discount for his guilty plea in accordance with well-established sentencing principles. As the plea was not entered until 8 February 2011 the discount to be allowed should be at the lower end of the accepted range as is appropriate for a late plea, namely, as stated earlier a ten per cent discount on sentence.

280The sentence for the obtain benefit by deception offence will be one of 1 year 9 months after a reduction of 3 months on account of the respondent's plea of guilty.

281The total effective sentence will be one of 5 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months.

Orders

282I propose the following orders:

(1) Appeal allowed.

(2) The sentences imposed by the District Court on 1 July 2011 be set aside.

(3) The respondent be re-sentenced as follows:

(i) In respect of the offence of dishonestly obtain benefit by deception under s 178BA Crimes Act 1900, the respondent be sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 1 year 3 months commencing on 1 June 2011 and to expire on 31 August 2012 with a parole period of 6 months to expire on 28 February 2013. 

(ii) In respect of the offence of aggravated indecent assault of CA under s 61M(1) Crimes Act 1900, the respondent be sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole of 1 year 2 months commencing on 1 June 2012 and to expire on 31 July 2013 and a parole period of 4 months to expire on 30 November 2013. 

(iii) In respect of the offence of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with intent under s 33 Crimes Act 1900, the respondent be sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 1 December 2012 and expiring on 30 November 2014 with a parole period of 2 years to expire on 30 November 2016.

283Accordingly, the first date upon which the respondent will be eligible for release on parole will be 30 November 2014.

284R A HULME J: In relation to the applicant's conviction for the offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent, I agree with the judgment of the Chief Justice.

285I record that upon my own assessment of the evidence, whilst I have a doubt as to whether the applicant did not honestly believe that the surgery was proper surgery for the complainant's benefit, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he did not honestly believe that she consented to an operation of the magnitude of that which was performed.

286I also agree with the judgment of Hall J in relation to the Crown appeal against sentence. My judgment that follows concerns the application for leave to appeal against conviction for the offences of aggravated indecent assault. 

Appeal against conviction - aggravated indecent assault

287The five counts for which the applicant was indicted at the second trial (see the early paragraphs of the judgment of the Chief Justice as to the course of the various proceedings) concerned separate incidents involving five different complainants who were all female patients of the applicant. Each of the incidents was alleged to have occurred in the applicant's consulting room in the course of him conducting a medical examination on the complainant. 

288In short form, the five counts were as follows:

Count 1: Aggravated indecent assault of MG between 10-25 June 2002.

Count 2: Aggravated indecent assault of KB between 13-29 October 2002.

Count 3: Aggravated indecent assault of CA on 21 February 2003.

Count 4: Aggravated indecent assault of DM on 21 February 2003.

Count 5: Aggravated indecent assault of RF on 2 May 2003. 

The aggravating feature alleged in each count was that the complainant was under the authority of the applicant on the basis that he was her gynaecologist. 

289The trial judge found the applicant not guilty of counts 1, 2 and 4 and guilty of counts 3 and 5 (involving CA and RF). The applicant raises four grounds of appeal against his convictions. Although each count relates to a different complainant and separate events, the grounds of appeal are the same for each.

(1) The verdicts are unreasonable and unable to be supported having regard to the evidence. 

(2) The trial Judge erred by equating and/or conflating an assessment of the witnesses' honesty with an assessment of the witnesses' reliability and accuracy. 

(3) The trial Judge erred by placing too much reliance on the complainants' assessment years after the events as to how long they were touched on the clitoris in determining whether the contact with the clitoris could have been ""inadvertent"".

(4) The trial Judge erred in his approach to the delay in complaint and the forensic disadvantage suffered by the applicant. 

The evidence

290It is necessary to review the evidence in some detail before turning to the grounds of appeal.

Counts 1, 2 and 4

291The trial judge directed himself as to the law to be applied in relation to each count. This included directions on tendency and coincidence evidence, and the use to which evidence relating to one count could be used in relation to another. But ultimately, in delivering his verdicts, the judge explained ""that while some tendency and coincidence evidence has been admitted into evidence, because of the acquittals on counts 1, 2 and 4 it would be unhelpful to utilise that evidence, and I have not done so"" (AB 1411-1412).

292Mr Hamill SC for the applicant submitted that the result of his Honour's judgment was that the evidence in relation to each count should not be considered in relation to another count. It is therefore unnecessary to consider the evidence in relation to counts 1, 2 and 4 in order to determine the appeal against the two guilty verdicts.

Count 3 - CA

293CA was the complainant and only eye witness in relation to count 3. She gave evidence that she was first referred to the applicant by her general practitioner, Dr Patty Salisbury, for a pap smear. She had asked Dr Salisbury about the possibility of having a hysterectomy, but was informed that she was too young and should consider a tubal ligation instead (T86). Dr Salisbury gave evidence that she had in fact referred CA for a tubal ligation and this was confirmed by the doctor's referral letter (Exh K) (T160). 

294CA attended the applicant's consultation rooms on 21 February 2003. She had partially undressed and ascended the examination table when the applicant noticed a scar on her stomach from an ectopic pregnancy in 1994. She gave evidence that, ""he was just having a look, like a grin, smirk on his face. I think it was then that I mentioned that I didn't want to have any more kids so I'm looking into getting my tubes tied."" CA said that during the examination there was no sheet on the table, just a towel the applicant had placed on her left leg (T 87-88).

295The applicant informed her that he could use the existing scar to undertake a tubal ligation. CA said the applicant then ""placed a left hand on the top of my vagina... Just over the top of the pubic hair."" She did not think there was any need to do that; she was shocked (T 88-89). 

296The applicant told CA that she needed to relax. She then felt probably two or three of the applicant's fingers inserted into her vagina. She stated that the fingers just sat there for ""four or five seconds"", before ""I felt something cold inside my vagina, and then as I was lying there I felt something that stated rubbing over my clitoris."" At first she thought that it was ""a new device or machine... like dildos with the little clitoris-rubbing thing that it's got on them"" (T89).

297CA then gave the following evidence about her examination.

Q. Sorry, how long did you feel something in contact with your clitoris? How many seconds or minutes?
A. I wasn't really timing. From the time that I felt the cold to the time that he said it was all done.

Q. What happened over that time?
A. He just kept rubbing my clitoris, and he didn't stop.

Q. Did it feel like a light touch, a heavy touch or something in between?
A No, it was a - like a rubbing from side to side. If anything I thought I was being masturbated. After that had finished I felt a scrape and he said that it was all done.

...

Q. When you think back on it now, if you can try to reconstruct, how long was it - even though you say you weren't timing it at the time - how long do you say it was that something was rubbing your clitoris from side to side?
A. I'd say at least a minute in - in terms of - of - minutes. It just seemed to be forever. 

Q. Do you know what it was that was in contact with your clitoris?
A. If felt like a finger or thumb. (T 90)

298CA then was asked whether the applicant was wearing a glove or gloves at the time of the examination.

A. At first I wasn't sure, and it wasn't until 16 December 2008 when I got interviewed by one of the detectives and she'd asked me the same thing... there was no gloves on his hand at all.

...

Q. So in relation to the question about gloves, were you able to remember in 2008 whether or not he had a glove or gloves on or not?
A. Well, when I felt the scrape and my eyes sort of come back in focus, he had no gloves then, and it would have been - been to quick [sic] for him to put some on. When my clitoris was getting rubbed there was no feeling of rubber or anything like that. I have been stimulated before and I know how it feels (T 90-91).

299In cross-examination, CA repeated that she had felt something rubbing against her clitoris for what ""would have been around a minute"". She denied that it could have been for a matter of seconds (T105). She also maintained that the applicant had conducted the vaginal examination using his ungloved left hand and denied that what had occurred was an internal ultrasound (T99-103).

300After leaving the consultation room, CA told her husband SA that the examination was ""different"", but said she had left it at that. She thought her mind was playing tricks on her but in reality she knew that it was not (T91). SA gave evidence that his wife had been referred to the applicant for the purposes of having her ""tubes tied"". He said that following the examination ""she seemed a little agitated. I really don't know the reason why"" (T120).

301On the 20 March 2003, CA attended the Pambula Hospital where the applicant performed the tubal ligation on her. She gave evidence that she only knew he would be the operating doctor when she was filling out the admission forms at the hospital. Her evidence was:

Q. Did you know he was going to be the doctor to [do] it?
A. Only when I filled out the admission form at the hospital. I'd asked who the doctor was going to be and they said it was him.

Q. Did you consider proceeding with it or not proceeding with it or what?
A. I considered not proceeding with it and the only way I sort of logically got over that was if I had another kid I couldn't go through an abortion. At that time we weren't ready for another child so I couldn't put myself - and the main thing there, there'd be other people in the room as well, so it just wouldn't be me and him. So if anything I would've felt a little bit safer (T92).

302Following the operation she determined not to see the applicant to have her stiches from the surgery removed, and instead returned to Dr Salisbury for that procedure (T92).

303In February 2008, CA came across online reports of other allegations that had been made against the applicant. On that day, she showed the reports to her husband and told him what had occurred in the examination. SA said, ""that was the first instance I heard about the allegations of inappropriate touching. My wife was very emotional, she broke down very hard"" (T120-121).

304She then contacted Bega Police to make a complaint, before making a detailed statement on 16 December 2008. CA also contacted a law firm in relation to pursuing a civil claim against the accused for injuries resulting from the tubal ligation (T93-94). She received compensation in the sum of $36,000, which she described as ""not enough"" (T116).

Count 5 - RF

305RF was the complainant in relation to count 5. She gave evidence that she was referred to the applicant by her general practitioner, Dr Morton, after suffering painful and heavy menstrual periods. The applicant performed an abdominal ultrasound on RF where he identified about a dozen fibroids on her uterus (T167-168).

306RF agreed to also have an internal ultrasound. She said the applicant told her, ""Just rip your knickers off."" He helped her remove her pants and underwear on the examination table. She had been embarrassed as she had no towel to cover herself, and used the clothes she had removed instead (T168-169).

307RF gave evidence of being touched twice on the clitoris during the course of the ensuing examination. The following was what she said about the nature of the touching and its duration.

Nature of the touching

308The applicant showed RF the ultrasound probe to be inserted. She said: 

A. And then after he showed me that he put his hand on my fanny...(T169)

...

Q. So the right hand he has the instrument that is inserted. What do you say that [he] did with his left hand during the course of this. You said he put it on your fanny. What do you mean by that exactly?
A. Well, I was lying with my, you know, feet right up to my bum with my legs spread open as far as I could, and the - say that's my pubic hair bone, the pressure was like right on there and I could feel his fingers on like on either side like on me clitoris, so yeah.

Q. So part of his hand was over the top of the area of pubic hair?
A. Yeah, it was like - I don't know whether he was doing that just to try and open me up, I don't - I don't know, but it felt pretty uncomfortable.

Q. Where were the fingers in relation to your clitoris?
A. At first when - the first time he put his hand on me it was like right - if that was my clitoris it was like I could feel it going like that on my fanny.

HIS HONOUR: The witness indicates one hand over the top of the other.

Q. And indicating some movement?
A. Yeah, yeah, just like - I wouldn't say hard, and it wasn't just light, it was like a medium pressure there, and then he wriggled the machine around, and then he moved his hand to do whatever he had to do, then he put his hand back there again, but this time it felt like it was more - if that was my opening it was like that, his hand felt like it was like right on that part where my clitoris is. Am I making any sense? (T170) (Emphasis added)

309There was then some discussion about what it was that the witness was trying to demonstrate which was not clearly explained for the benefit of a reader of the transcript. The evidence continued:

Q. Did you feel anything connect with your clitoris itself?
A. Yes. I don't know if it was his finger or his thumb I don't know but something like I said not heavy, not light rubbed you know across my clitoris. I don't know, it was just quickly like it didn't go on for my whole internal ultrasound or anything like that. It was the two times that when he first put his hand on my fanny to put the instrument in then you know like he's wiggled it around and his hand is there, then he's done whatever he's done to the computer or to the machine. Then he put his hand up there again and wiggled the machine around and then that's when he's turned the TV screen around for me to have a look at the fibroids.

Q. On the second occasion that you just indicated when he puts his hand back there, was there any connection made with your clitoris then?
A. The same as the first time. Like I don't know if he was meant to do that to make it go in, I don't know. (T172) (Emphasis added)

310At the end of her evidence in chief the prosecutor took RF back to the nature of the touching:

Q. When you described the first touching of the clitoris there was some movement to you --?
A. Yes, both times there was. Not like that, just like -

Q. Not - you're saying moving your finger vigorously in the first instance and saying not vigorous, is that right?
A. Like he wasn't going like that on it, I could just feel his hand going like that across it, not like that or anything just his fingers was going like that across it, not -

HIS HONOUR: The witness indicates in the first instance a fast motion and the second instance a slow motion.

WITNESS: Yes so it wasn't fast. It wasn't like that, it was like that over it.

CROWN PROSECUTOR

Q. Rubbing it -
A. Yeah like he was just like rubbing it. He wasn't flicking it or. (T177)

311In cross-examination, RF gave the following evidence about the nature of the touching:

Q. You told us that there was contact, you believe, between you and the accused - well, you felt something touch your clitoris on two occasions, correct?
A. Mm-hmm, my whole fanny.

Q. I'm sorry, I need you to answer yes or no? Is this your evidence, that you felt something touch your clitoris on two occasions?
A. Yes.

Q. On each occasion, was that around the time that the accused had put his left hand in your pubic area in the way you've indicated, with the thumb and the forefinger, as it were, on either side of your labia, is that right?
A. Well, that's - I don't know if it was exact fingers. I had my hand like this - I could just feel it.

Q. You weren't watching?
A. No.

HIS HONOUR: The witness indicates that she wasn't actually watching her crotch area.

[COUNSEL FOR THE APPLICANT]

Q. In relation to each of those contacts - correct me if I'm wrong - you said that the accused put his hand in that area?
A. Yes.

Q. And then moved away to the machine and then moved back -
A. He didn't move away from me. He still had the instrument inside me with his hand like that, moved his hand away, done whatever he done, because I could hear it, then -

HIS HONOUR

Q. You mean moved his left hand?
A. Yes. And then the hand - I felt the pressure back there again. He'd done whatever he'd had to do with the instrument, I'm assuming, to find the fibroids. Then his hand moved again and then that's when he turned the screen around for me to have a look at what the fibroids were.

[COUNSEL FOR THE APPLICANT]

Q. Each of the times you say you felt contact with your clitoris -
A. Yes

Q. - that was shortly after he'd put his hand back in position?
A. Yes.

Q. Is that correct?
A. Yes.

Q. Can you help me with this if you can? Was the position that he had his hand consistent with his trying to separate the -
A. His -

Q. - separate your genital area, on either side?
A. Yes. (T182 - 183) (Emphasis added)

312RF was asked whether when she felt contact with her clitoris she said anything to the accused. She said that she did not; she ""just tensed up""; she did not ask him to stop. The evidence continued:

Q. Was that because you were unable to say either way whether or not that was just a part of the procedure?
A. Like I said to [the prosecutor] that - I don't know if that's how it was meant to have his hand and do what he was doing to get things in, I don't know I just felt really uncomfortable and embarrassed with it.

Q. In relation to contact didn't you tell us that you felt something rub across your clitoris quickly?
A. Well like I said it wasn't quick like this, just when the hand was there I felt it go whatever, whether it be the knuckle, his finger, his thumb, I don't know, but something rubbed across my clitoris. (T184).

313In re-examination, RF was asked about her agreement with the proposition that the applicant's actions were consistent with trying to separate her genital area. An objection to the question was overruled and the evidence continued:

Q. What part of the actions were consistent with separating the genital area?
A. Just the way that he had his hand like that, I'm just assuming that's how he was opening it up, but I can't - I don't know.

Q. When you answered that in relation to consistent with trying to separate the genital area, were you talking about the first time or the second time or both?
A. Both times how he had his hand like - I could feel the pressure of his - like the warmth of his hand on top of me and then it was over and I could feel it like on either side of my flap.

Q. Use whichever terms you are comfortable with?
A. So it felt like it was on like either side of that and a movement on top of my clitoris, but like I said, I could feel it moving but it wasn't like a fast motion, I could just feel it like going across. So I don't know if he was meant to do that.

Q. Between the first time and the second time, was the probe removed or did it stay in?
A. No it was still inside me (T193).

Duration of the touching

314RF gave the following evidence as to length of time the applicant made contact with her clitoris. Included in a passage extracted from the transcript above she said ""it was just quickly like it didn't go on for my whole internal ultrasound or anything like that"" (T172). She was asked about the duration of the touching on each of the two occasions and she said ""it felt like a long time but I don't know"" (T172).

315RF was cross-examined on the duration of the touching on each occasion:

Q. In relation to the contact that you felt with your clitoris - I'm asking not suggesting - was it momentary on each occasion?
A. No, it was there for, like while he was moving that - moving the machine around. So I don't know if it was for a minute, two minutes, three minutes. It wasn't like 20 minutes that he had his hand there for, but on both times he had his hands there like that while he was moving the machine around. (T183) (Emphasis added)

Evidence of subsequent events

316Following the examination, RF agreed to have a vaginal hysterectomy and the applicant made arrangements for him to conduct the surgery on 8 May 2003 at Pambula Hospital. Under cross-examination, RF stated that she agreed to the applicant conducting the operation because ""I trusted him. Why wouldn't I?"" 

Q. So it's the case that at that stage, although you thought that there may have been something wrong that had happened in the examination you were still happy for him to operate on you?
A. I felt very uncomfortable with what happened in his surgery but like I said to you, I didn't know if he was meant to touch me like that or not so - yeah. (T185-186)

317RF denied that she seen the applicant more than once prior to the surgery. However, a second visit was supported by contemporaneous notes made by the applicant (Exhibits 21 and 32).

318At the surgery, RF received a spinal block anaesthetic from Dr Thomas, the attending anaesthetist. She was told to sit still before the needle was administered to her spine. She gave evidence that, with her legs hanging off the operating table, the applicant moved to a position between her legs and told her to ""hold onto him and held me so I wouldn't move and I wrapped my arms and legs around [the applicant]"" (T174).

319In this position, while the spinal block was being administered, RF said ""I actually felt his penis or - flex against like the inside of my leg and the side of my fanny... right up near my - where your knickers go in your groin there, in that area."" At the time she was only wearing a hospital nightgown. She described the contact occurring for ""[a] few minutes, a couple of seconds. Say a few minutes"" (T174-175).

320It was RF's evidence that what had occurred in the operating theatre changed her mind about the applicant. She saw the applicant twice while recovering in hospital. But she said that she had determined not to see him again after leaving hospital and sarcastically commented to the nurse about the applicant's ""lovely bedside manner"" as she left.

321Other than RF and the applicant, there were six people present at the surgery on 8 May 2003. Dr Thomas made a statement that he could not recall the procedure, but that having a patient wrap her arms and legs around a person, as described by RF, would have struck him, as it would inhibit the administration of the spinal block (Exhibit 26). It was an agreed fact that none of the other five people present could recall the surgery either and did not have any record of anything unusual occurring (Exhibit 27).

322When it was put to her in cross-examination, RF disputed that she had subsequently attended the applicant's rooms 12 days after the surgery on 20 May 2003. This was contradicted by the applicant's notes, attendance records and correspondence concerning outstanding fees (Exhibits 17,18 and 21).

323RF said that she did not complain about what occurred with the applicant due to embarrassment and the desire to avoid attention after her husband had died. She also said, ""I didn't know [the applicant] had to put his hand where he did for me to have my internal ultrasound"" (T175). She said she finally decided to raise the complaint after hearing another former patient of the applicant on radio discussing her experience:

Q. What happened that finally made you come forward about these matters?
A. [First name of complainant in the first trial], I don't know her surname - it got to me when it was said on the radio that she'd lost her husband eight or nine months prior to her operation and things went wrong for her. And then I felt like, well maybe it wasn't my imagination because I'd just lost [name of former partner] 16 months beforehand and the same thing happened to me (T176) (Emphasis added).

324She attended a meeting at Bega RSL organised by the Medical Errors Action Group for former patients in March 2008. She subsequently received compensation of $42,000 in relation a civil matter concerning the hysterectomy performed by the applicant.

Expert evidence

325The Crown called two expert witnesses to give evidence, relevant to both counts 3 and 5, as to the proper procedures for conducting vaginal and internal examinations. Dr Andrew Pesce, a specialist gynaecologist and obstetrician, described any contact with the clitoris that would occur when performing a pap smear or internal ultrasound ""would be incidental if not accidental... if there is any contact it would be transient"" (T195).

326The doctor stated that when separating the labia for a pap smear or insertion of an ultrasound probe, the crucial application of the fingers is ""in the middle... there would probably be some incidental contact with the upper part of the lower vagina, heading towards the clitoris as well"" (T196).

327Dr Pesce agreed that gynaecologists were trained to position their left hand above or slightly over the pubic hair area when conducting a vaginal examination to counterpressure the internal hand pushing from below (T210). He agreed that the internal hand would then be gloved, but it was common practice for a gynaecologist to only use one glove (T196).

328Dr Pesce said that if a professional doctor's hand were resting on the mons pubis, he would go to every length possible to minimise contact with the clitoris. As to whether there was any acceptable reason for the clitoral area to be rubbed from side to side during these examinations, Dr Pesce responded:

A. I can imagine because everything is so close together there might be some accidental very brief contact that would be consistent with what you describe but it should be very brief and not last more than a couple of seconds at most (T198).

...

Q. Is there any acceptable reason for the clitoris to be manipulated with the finger during any of these routine gynaecological examinations?
A. Not intentionally no (T199).

329In cross-examination the doctor agreed with the propositions that a gynaecologist is vulnerable to a patient misinterpreting their actions in and around a sensitive and private area, and that there may be incidental touching of the clitoris in the performance of gynaecological procedures (T218).

330Dr Andrew Korda, a professor of obstetrics and gynaecology, also gave evidence that a major effort is made to avoid the clitoris when inserting a speculum for a pap smear or an ultrasound probe, though it could occur inadvertently (T238-240). 

The applicant

331The applicant gave evidence, relying predominantly on his clinical notes regarding the complainants. There were also a number of documents tendered during his evidence. He said that he had no particular recollection of any of the complainants or the consultations that gave rise to the counts on the indictment. Between 1983 and 2004 (when he ceased to practice as a gynaecologist) he had seen 9,000 or 10,000 patients. He denied ever touching a patient's clitoris for purposes of sexual gratification; he had never touched the clitoris of a patient other than for a proper medical purpose (T298-299).

332The applicant stated that he always used a glove on his right hand when conducting an internal examination. He also stated that he provided gowns and modesty sheets at all times for his patients' privacy (T298). He also described his procedure for using the ultrasound probe and the speculum during a pap smear (T305-306).

333Relying on his notes, the applicant contradicted CA on the reason she gave for her referral to him. He indicated that she was referred to him in relation to a tubal ligation but he had also undertaken a routine pap smear (T397). He denied using any dildo and stated that he had used an ultrasound probe.

334The applicant again relied on his clinical notes in relation to RF. Contrary to her denials, he stated that he had conducted a breast examination on her first visit to his rooms on 2 May 2003 and prescribed her with Danazole, a restricted medication (T348). The applicant denied that he deliberately made contact with RF's clitoris, but accepted that inadvertent contact was possible with the manipulation of the opening of the labia during an examination (T351). As noted above, it was his evidence that on 6 May 2003, RF again attended his rooms and arrangements were made for her to be placed on the surgery list for two days later, following a cancellation (T351). 

335In relation to her surgery, he agreed with Dr Pesce that the positioning RF described would be counter productive to administering the spinal block, as having the patient wrap her legs and arms around someone in front of them would move them away from the anaesthetist (T352). In cross-examination, he said he had suffered complications from a catheter following prostate surgery in 1997 and since then was unable to achieve an erection, making it impossible for his penis to have flexed against RF (T422). This evidence was supported by notes of the applicant's psychiatrist (Exh 40). The applicant also gave evidence about RF visiting him at his consultation rooms on a third occasion on 20 May 2003 (T353).

Ground 1 - The verdicts are unreasonable and unable to be supported having regard to the evidence.

336The applicant asks this Court to quash the verdicts of the trial judge on the ground that they are unreasonable and unable to be supported having regard to the evidence: s 6(1), Criminal Appeal Act 1912. This ground of appeal requires the Court to make an independent assessment as to the sufficiency and quality of the evidence: M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487, SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400. The principles that inform this assessment were succinctly set out in the joint judgment of McClellan CJ at CL, Fullerton and Garling JJ in Gilham v R [2012] NSWCCA 131:

[465] Section 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provides that a verdict may be set aside if it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. As the High Court recently confirmed in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400 at [14], when considering whether or not the verdict of a jury was unreasonable the appellate court is to make its own independent assessment of the evidence both as to sufficiency and quality. The question that an appeal court is required to determine is whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, ""nonetheless it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand"": M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 492-493. Only in circumstances where a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal can be resolved by the jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence can the court conclude that no miscarriage of justice has occurred: M at 494 quoted with approval in SKA at [13].

337The central task of an appeal court considering this ground of appeal is to determine whether, upon the whole of the evidence, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty: M v The Queen at 493. This was confirmed in SKA v The Queen (at [11]) where it was held (at [24]) that this Court had erred by undertaking that task without any weighing of the competing evidence. 

338The Crown case at trial, in relation to both counts 3 and 5, relied on the evidence of the respective complainant, and the applicant's submissions in this Court were essentially directed at the reliability of that evidence. Mr Hamill SC for the applicant said that the crux of the applicant's case was that the complainants were mistaken about the touching that formed the basis of the two convictions, and that mistake involved an exaggeration (though not necessarily a deliberate one) of its nature and duration (13.8.12 T26). The Crown Prosecutor agreed that the duration and circumstances of the touching are pivotal to determining this ground of the appeal (13.8.12 T29).

339Mr Hamill submitted that there was a reasonable possibility that the complainants were mistaken about what occurred because of the delay in making the complaints and the media publicity that by then had surrounded the applicant. The submissions for the applicant addressed a variety of other matters as well in support of the overall contention that there was a reasonable doubt about his guilt in respect of both complainants.

340The Crown submitted that the trial judge had the significant advantage of observing the witnesses give evidence, particularly because the Crown case relied solely upon the evidence of the complainants (CWS 27). The matters raised concerning the reliability of the complainants were the subject of cross-examination at trial and considered by the trial judge. It was submitted that any doubt experienced by this Court would be one capable of being resolved by the tribunal of fact when seeing and hearing the evidence: M v The Queen at 494. However, Mr Hamill submitted that where the issue was not whether a witness is truthful, but whether the witness is honest yet mistaken, the trial judge's advantage in seeing and hearing the witnesses would be somewhat diminished (AWS 35).

341With reference to these issues raised in the submissions, I now propose to assess the evidence in relation to each count to determine whether it was open to the trial judge to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty.

Count 3 - CA

342It is appropriate to commence with reference to a number of matters that were uncontroversial.

343There was nothing raised by the evidence that would cause doubt about the trial judge's finding that CA was under the authority of the applicant at the relevant time. She was in a vulnerable position, semi-naked and the subject of an intimate examination, and had entrusted her care to the applicant, a medical professional. Similarly, there was no suggestion that CA had consented to being touched indecently. 

344The contested point, in considering whether it was open to the trial judge to be satisfied of the applicant's guilt, was whether the applicant touched CA's clitoris during the examination in a way that was of such a duration and nature as to constitute indecent assault. 

345If CA's evidence of the nature and length of time that the applicant touched her clitoris is accepted as accurate, that touching could not be characterised as having been ""incidental"" to or a ""misinterpretation"" of an innocent act. CA described the touching as a deliberate ""rubbing side to side"" that continued for ""about a minute"". This description goes well beyond inadvertent touching that may be possible during a proper medical examination. If her account is accepted as accurate, it would constitute deliberate touching for personal sexual gratification on the part of the applicant.

346The applicant's case was a clear denial of the incident. He had no recollection of CA, but said he would never touch the clitoris of a patient for sexual purposes (T299). It was submitted that there was a reasonable possibility that CA's account of the examination misrepresented the duration and nature of any touching, and that what touching, if any, did occur would have been incidental to a proper medical procedure. 

347It was submitted there were a number of evidentiary matters that, if accepted, would lead this Court to reach the conclusion that the applicant's case represented a reasonably possible version of events. The applicant relied upon these matters both individually and for their cumulative effect. Some, however, may be dismissed as having no individual force and thereby contributing nothing to the cumulative effect.

The complainant's evidence was erroneous in relation to important details, the error being established by the applicant's notes or by independent evidence

348In support of this contention there was reference to a number of matters: CA's evidence as to why she was referred to the applicant, her evidence denying that he had conducted an examination of her breasts, her evidence concerning the nature of the gynaecological examinations the applicant performed and her denial that she was not aware that the applicant would be the doctor to perform the tubal ligation until she attended the hospital for that procedure.

349It was submitted that CA was contradicted by objective evidence as to the reason for her being referred by Dr Salisbury to the applicant. It was put that she ""maintained that she had been referred to the applicant, and had gone to see him, solely for a pap smear"" and that ""[s]he denied that she had been referred for the purpose of having a tubal ligation"" (AWS [10] (vi)).

350I am doubtful that this accurately summarises the effect of the evidence given by CA, but in any event do not regard the issue as being of any significance.

351The applicant's notes (Exhibits 30 and 32) and Dr Salisbury's referral letter (Exhibit K) reflect that CA was referred for the purpose of tubal ligation.

352CA's evidence was that she had three children and had decided with her husband that they did not want to have any more. She wanted to have a hysterectomy and consulted Dr Salisbury. She gave the following evidence about that consultation:

Q. What did you see her about?
A. Just inquiring about a hysterectomy. The reply was that I was too young. The other option I had was to have my tubes tied.

...

Q. Did Dr Salisbury mention something about referring you to another doctor?
A. Yeah.

Q. To who was she talking about referring you to?
A. Oh just somewhere in Pambula, they do things like that up there.

Q. What sort of doctor was she going to send you to?
A. She didn't really say just that they don't - well she doesn't do things like that there so the place that they do tubes and things is at the hospital.

Q. All right was a particular doctor's name mentioned to you?
A. No.

Q. Did you get an appointment to see [the applicant]?
A. Yes. (T86)

353CA saw the applicant on 21 February 2003. On that occasion he performed a Pap smear. There was a discussion about having the tubal ligation surgery in the future. She gave the following evidence about this consultation:

Q. Did you know that he was going to do any particular examination on you?
A. I was just there for a Pap smear.

Q. I see.
A. Yeah just, that was it. (T87)

354The effect of this evidence is that for the purpose of having the tubal ligation carried out CA was referred by Dr Salisbury to the applicant and that at the first meeting with him she knew that he would examine her there and then by way of performing a Pap smear. It does not amount to evidence that ""she had been referred to the applicant, and had gone to see him, solely for a pap smear"". 

355Towards the end of her cross-examination CA gave the following evidence:

Q. Ma'am, when you went to see the accused, as far as you were concerned, what were you going to see him for?
A. On which particular event?

Q. On the first occasion you saw him on 21 February?
A. I went there to get a Pap smear done.

Q. Are you sure about that, ma'am, that that was why you went to see him?
A. Yes. I didn't go there for no sexual pleasure. If I had I wouldn't have gone to him. I'm sorry.

Q. Did you go to see the accused to have your tubes tied?
A. No, he was just the doctor that performed it.

Q. Hadn't you been referred to the accused by Dr Salisbury for the operation of a tubal ligation, in other words, to have your tubes tied?
A. I don't know whether I got referred to him or not. Would you like to see it, you're talking - I'm sorry, your Honour. Would you like to see what happened over my stomach. I'm here because he touched me sexually in my Pap smear, not my stomach (T113 - 114).

356At that point CA became emotional and, after a short break, the cross-examination continued on other subjects.

357CA said in her evidence in chief (T88) and in cross-examination (T95) that very early in the consultation on 21 February 2003 she told the applicant of her desire to have a tubal ligation. There was no reason for her to tell him that unless that was a reason for her to see him.

358In my view, it is not at all clear that CA was maintaining that the sole purpose of her referral to the applicant was for a Pap smear, or that she denied that she had been referred for the purpose of having a tubal ligation.

359The second point was that CA denied that the applicant had conducted a breast examination whereas the applicant's contemporaneous notes recorded that he did (AWS [10](vii)). In cross-examination when asked if she had any memory of the applicant doing an examination of her breasts she said, ""[h]e didn't touch my breasts""; and she was ""[a] hundred per cent positive"" of that (T105). The applicant's clinical notes record, and it was his evidence based on those notes, that on examination ""breasts normal"" (Exhibit 32; T329). Assuming that the examination involved touching, this is too peripheral a detail to expect a woman to remember in relation to a medical consultation that occurred eight years previously.

360CA denied that she had been given ""a brochure about the procedure of having your tubes tied"" by the applicant at the consultation on 21 February 2003 (T106), whereas his contemporaneous notes record, and he confirmed in his evidence relying upon those notes, that he did (Exhibit 30; T329). This is of no significance. Expecting a person to remember being handed a brochure eight years previously is unrealistic.

361Reference was made (AWS [21] and [44]) to CA's evidence was that she was unaware that the applicant would be the doctor who would perform the tubal ligation procedure until she arrived at the hospital. It was pointed out in the written submissions for the applicant (AWS [21]) that his letter to Dr Salisbury dated the day of the consultation on 21 February included that ""the admission papers"" had been provided to CA that day (Exhibit 30; AB 821). 

362Exhibit 8 is a consent form signed by both the applicant and CA and dated 21 February 2003. A line of type which reads ""I have not been told that the procedure/treatment will be done by a particular doctor"" has been crossed out. The applicant said that by crossing that out he was ""indicating that it was me that was going to do the surgery"". He also said ""I would have told her that I was going to do the procedure"" (T331). 

363The fact that he had no actual recollection at all of the consultation, or of CA, does not inspire confidence that he did in fact tell her. In any event, her explanation that she proceeded to undergo the surgery, notwithstanding his conduct on 21 February 2003 is a reasonable one. It is understandable that she would think that nothing untoward could occur in the presence of other medical professionals. When she was required to return in a week to have her stitches removed, which would have required seeing the applicant alone, she chose instead to see Dr Salisbury for their removal (T92).

364I am not persuaded that there is anything significant in terms of adversely affecting the reliability of CA's evidence in relation to any of these asserted contradictions by the applicant's notes or independent evidence.

Other matters giving rise to a reasonable doubt

365There were a number of other features of the evidence that were said to support the proposition that there was a reasonable doubt as to the applicant's guilt.

366It was submitted that the touching upon which the allegation by CA was based took place in the course of a gynaecological examination where incidental (innocent) touching of the clitoris was possible. There was expert evidence by Dr Pesce as to this. He said that ""any contact with the clitoris would be incidental if not accidental ... [and] would be relatively transient"" (T195). In cross-examination, he agreed with the proposition that ""a gynaecologist is vulnerable to [a] patient misinterpreting their actions in and around an area which is necessarily sensitive and private"" (T218).

367This does not advance the case for the applicant. What CA described was far from ""incidental"" or ""transient"". At one point she said ""He just kept rubbing my clitoris, and he didn't stop"" and ""I thought I was being masturbated"" (T90). She maintained in cross-examination that this occurred for ""around a minute"" and denied a suggestion that it was ""a matter of seconds"" (T105).

368There was a general criticism of CA's evidence because it ""showed a tendency to adopt sexualized language when describing what had occurred and the medical procedures conducted upon her"" (AWS [10](viii); [109]). At one point she referred to the applicant ""fondling with something that was in the trolley next to the bed"" (T88.16). There seems to be cause to either doubt the accuracy of the transcript or to consider that CA may have misspoken. The trial judge immediately indicated that he had not heard the answer and asked CA to speak up. When she repeated the evidence a short time later, the transcript records her has having said ""fumbling around with whatever was on the shelf"" (T88.46).

369CA said that at one point during the examination she felt something cold inside her vagina. When asked if she knew what it was she said:

""A. I thought it was a new device or a machine. I don't use them, but I've seen like dildos with the little clitoris-rubbing thing that it's got on them. I had an impression that it might have been something like that""

Q. Did you look down to see what it might have been in that area?
A. No, because when I realised that he wasn't going to stop and that was no device, I just shut my eyes, I wriggled ..."" (T89 - 90).

370Reference was also made to CA's evidence of being ""pleasured"" and saying ""I've been stimulated before and I know how it feels"". These need to be seen in context. The first appeared in answer to a question concerning her reason for not saying anything to the applicant at the time of the incident; she responded:

""I thought the shock of it. I wasn't there to be pleasured in any sort of way. I was there for a Pap smear and a Pap smear only and the things that I was feeling I knew wasn't right"" (T90).

371The context of the other response was that CA was being asked about whether the applicant used a glove, or gloves. She said:

""Well, when I felt the scrape and my eyes sort of come back in focus, he had no gloves then, and it would have been - been to quick for him to put some on. When my clitoris was getting rubbed there was no feeling of rubber or anything like that. I've been stimulated before and I know how it feels"" (T91).

372In each of these responses it would seem that CA was doing her best to convey to the court her perceptions of what she saw and felt. I do not see any reason to take an adverse view about her credibility on this account.

373It was submitted that CA had ""a bone to pick"" with the applicant (AWS [110]). She demonstrated anger towards him whilst she was giving evidence, apparently as a result of the lasting ill-effects of the tubal ligation surgery. It was not suggested that this motivated her to give dishonest evidence and, beyond speculation, it is not apparent how it bore upon the reliability of her evidence.

374Reliance was placed upon the applicant's notes generally as providing a ""contemporaneous and reliable record of events as they took place"" (AWS [111]). Where there is conflict between the oral evidence and the notes, clearly the notes should be preferred. The notes are, of course, silent on the question whether the applicant did, or did not, indecently assault CA. 

375A number of submissions were made concerning the fact that CA did not raise her complaint about the applicant's conduct until 2008 when others had done so. 

376It was contended that it seemed ""that the complainant, at the time of the examination, did not know or believe that the touching was other than in the course of the gynaecological examination"" (AWS [10](iii)). There is no evidence to support that proposition; indeed, the evidence is to the contrary. CA said that when the applicant put his hand on the top of her vagina she thought ""there was no need to do that"" (T89.4). She said that, when the applicant was rubbing her clitoris, ""I thought I was being masturbated"" (T90.15). She did not say anything to the applicant about what he was doing because of ""the shock of it"" (T90.25). She also said, ""it was a feeling of disbelief that - that this wasn't happening, because there's - it wasn't right"" (T91.5). 

377It is true, as the submissions for the applicant observe (AWS [10](x)), that when CA did raise her complaint in 2008 it was in the context of a substantial amount of publicity concerning the applicant. 

378CA's evidence about being prompted to complain after seeing an article on the internet concerning the applicant has been referred to earlier. After she disclosed to her husband what the applicant had done she contacted a detective at Bega. She completed what she described as a ""declaration form of what happened"" which was sent to Bega police (CA was living interstate at the time). Subsequently an officer suggested that she should engage a solicitor. Ultimately she was referred to a firm of solicitors who she instructed to act for her in a medical negligence action concerning the tubal ligation surgery the applicant had performed (T94).

379CA was asked if she had spoken to any of the applicant's patients. She said she had not, and added ""[t]he only one I've seen which has been on the computer or something would be [the complainant in the first trial], I wouldn't know any others"" (T94).

380The reasons given by CA for not saying anything to the applicant about his conduct have been noted earlier. Her reasons for not complaining immediately to her husband or the police bears noting:

Q. Did you say anything to him about what happened?
A. Not just what happened no. He just asked me how things went and I just said, all that was different and I'd left it as that. In my mind I thought it was just me playing tricks, that - but in reality I knew that it wasn't.

Q. Did you consider making any formal complaint ab",2013-02-20 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2707154,Withyman (by his tutor Glenda Ruth Withyman) v State of New South Wales and Blackburn; Blackburn v Withyman (by his tutor Glenda Ruth Withyman) [2013] NSWCA 10,"Judgment

1ALLSOP P: These are appeals, and applications for leave to appeal, from a comprehensive and careful judgment by Elkaim DCJ concerning a female school teacher (Ms Blackburn) who was found to have had a sexual relationship with a pupil in her class (Mr Withyman), who turned 18 shortly after the relationship began. The school was a special care school located in country New South Wales.

2Ms Blackburn was found liable to Mr Withyman, against which she appeals. The claim of Mr Withyman against the State (Ms Blackburn's employer) was dismissed, against which Mr Withyman appeals. The State also appeals, contingently, against the dismissal of its cross-claim against Ms Blackburn. If Mr Withyman's appeal against the State is upheld, and if the State is liable to him, the State seeks indemnity or contribution from Ms Blackburn.

3Before dealing with the appeals, it is necessary to set out the essential facts from the reasons of the primary judge. The care and thoroughness of his Honour's reasons should be acknowledged at the outset.

Facts

4During 2002 and 2003, Ms Blackburn was a teacher at Carenne Public School in Bathurst. She was 29 years of age in 2003. Mr Withyman was a student at the school. He turned 18 at the end of March 2003. The school served students with severe to moderate intellectual or physical disabilities. It can be accepted that Mr Withyman had, at least, a behavioural disorder. For reasons which will become apparent in explaining why Ms Blackburn's appeal succeeds, the nature of any intellectual impairment of Mr Withyman is an issue for future determination.

5Mr Withyman's case was that between March and October 2003, there was a consensual sexual relationship between him and Ms Blackburn, the termination of which caused him significant psychological harm and damage. The primary judge summarised the claim at [6] of his reasons:

""The nature of a relationship between the plaintiff and the second defendant is central to the case. The plaintiff alleges a passionate sexual liaison lasting about six months. Its termination by the second defendant precipitated a downward spiral into depression and crime.""

6Ms Blackburn denied any sexual contact between them. This was the central factual issue in the case. As the primary judge put it at [7] of his reasons:

""The second defendant denies any sexual activity. She says there was a friendship with the plaintiff that grew from her desire to help him with his learning problems. His descriptions of sex and romance are fanciful.""

7The primary judge dealt with the resolution of this central issue at [360] - [379]. These paragraphs follow his Honour's analysis of each witness' evidence.

8Whilst the primary judge found Mr Withyman's evidence unreliable (see [362] - [363]), his Honour concluded that there had been a sexual relationship during the period March to September or October 2003, without any precise specificity of dates: [379]. As to findings of the primary judge as to dates, see [27] below. The reasons for that conclusion at [365] - [378] reveal a careful weighing of at least eight considerations, some contrary to others. Determinative for the primary judge was the evidence of Ms Minato. She was a former friend of Ms Blackburn from Teacher's College, to whom Ms Blackburn had spoken contemporaneously with the events and with whom Ms Blackburn communicated later in an attempt by her to obtain Ms Minato's evidence in a case before the Industrial Relations Commission (the ""IRC""). The case was brought by Ms Blackburn following her dismissal from employment, which dismissal was based on a conclusion by the Department of Education that she had had a sexual relationship with Mr Withyman. Included in the evidence of Ms Minato in the proceedings before the primary judge were various emails between Ms Minato and Ms Blackburn. I will deal with them in due course, but I consider that the emails are fatal to, and destructive of, any attack on the finding of the occurrence of the sexual relationship.

9Whatever the precise nature and extent of Mr Withyman's disabilities, a number of matters are to be noted by way of background to the sexual relationship with Ms Blackburn in 2003. Mr Withyman sexually assaulted another female teacher in 2000. Mr Withyman was then 15 years old. It is not necessary to name the teacher in question. She is referred to by the primary judge at [297] - [301]. I will refer to her as Ms W. She was 41 years of age. The nature of the assault is, however, relevant in the assessment of what the State should have foreseen, or not, about Ms Blackburn and Mr Withyman. Ms W's evidence was that she had ""personal space issues"" with Mr Withyman from the time that she began to teach him in 2000 (Blue vol 5, 2428, para 22). She initially treated this as a lack of awareness on his part; but she became concerned. She said that his touching of her moved from being gentle to becoming more forceful (Blue vol 5, 2429 - 2430, para 29). On one occasion he touched her breast. She reported the incidents to the Principal, Mr Roxborough, in a conversation which included the following:

""Me: Jock [Mr Roxborough] I want to talk to you about David Withyman.

Jock: What's the problem?

Me: I am concerned about David's behaviour towards me. There have been several incidents of touching from David, but the other day when we were getting ready for parent morning tea David touched my breast which I'm sure was not an accident.

Jock: Well they are pre-pubescent boys and just get on with it, it's a social skills issue.

Me: Well I have been teaching the class about personal space as part of their social skills.

Jock: Don't let them call you [Ms W's name with a ""y"" added] as its overly familiar.

Me: Thanks Jock, I'll just keep going.""

10There were further minor incidents with Mr Withyman about closeness and personal space, until one incident in 2002, which Ms W described as follows in para 36 of her affidavit in the IRC proceedings:

""I was standing in a still position in the playground monitoring the students, and David came out of the glass doors of the building at the back of the school leading to the playground and he came straight towards me. I was standing about 25-30 metres away from the doors. The fact that David was walking towards me did not concern me as he would often seek me out in the playground for a chat, or if for instance I was on bike duty he would approach me there. As David was approaching it appeared to me that he was about to enter my personal space because of the manner in which he was grinning at me and the fact that he continued walking at a reasonable pace, I placed my right arm out in a 'stop' gesture and at the same time as I extended my arm he pushed my arm aside and in the same motion grabbed my crotch with his other hand and his body pushed forward onto mine and I stumbled backwards. As I was stumbling back his hand remained grabbing onto my crotch area and his hand remained there for about 4 or 5 seconds. I regained my balance and I pushed forward with my upper body or shoulder, and David stepped back and let go at the same time. I immediately yelled at him 'That is really inappropriate' and I recall that he did not say anything to me either before, during or after the incident. He simply smiled and walked away.""

The only proper characterisation of the event was as a sexual assault, intended by Mr Withyman to be humiliating of Ms W. Ms W said that it was ""excruciatingly painful"".

11The response of the Principal, Mr Roxborough, was described by Ms W in para 40 of her affidavit in the IRC proceedings, as follows:

""As I entered Jock's office I considered that I was visibly upset as my hands and voice were shaking and I had tears welling in my eyes. As I walked through the door I looked at Jock, and I said 'David Withyman has just assaulted me'. I remained standing and then a further conversation took place to the following effect:

Me: He grabbed me forcefully between the legs.

I then sat down.

Jock: What happened?

Me: I was on playground duty and David has walked up to me and just grabbed me between the legs.

He then looked straight at me and said:

Jock: Well did you kick him in the balls?

I gave no response and then stood up and walked out of his office.""

He gave her no other support and took no other step.

12In February 2001, Mr Withyman was required to enter a ""behaviour contract"" to obey the school rules. He had also signed such a ""contract"" in 1999.

13During 2002, Ms Rowe, a teacher's aide, worked with Ms Blackburn. She assisted Ms Blackburn in a class of children aged five to seven years. Mr Withyman, then 17 years old, would visit Ms Blackburn in this class for up to 15 to 20 minutes a day, over a two week period. The primary judge described the consequences of this at [210] of his reasons:

""During 2002, but she [Ms Rowe] was not sure when, she noticed that the plaintiff [Mr Withyman] would visit the classroom for up to 15 to 20 minutes a day. This occurred over about a two week period. She was concerned, not because of anything improperly done by the plaintiff, but rather because she wanted to maintain the privacy of the younger children. Some of them had personal needs, such as the changing of catheters, which she felt ought not take place in the presence of an older student. As a result of her concerns she spoke to Ms Lee Churches, the Deputy Principal, and also the teacher in the other classroom in the courtyard. She later said that she had, to some extent, spoken to Ms Churches both on her behalf and on behalf of Ms Blackburn. As a result of speaking to Ms Churches she understood that Ms Churches, in turn, spoke to the plaintiff. Following this conversation the plaintiff's attendance dropped off and he did not come as often for a couple of weeks. In this period he made one or two fleeting visits.""

14After a period of two weeks, the visits began again. The primary judge described the circumstances and consequences of these visits at [211], as follows:

""After the two weeks, however, he went back to his previous level of visiting. He would help put out equipment and generally chat. He spoke to both Mrs Rowe and Ms Blackburn. Mrs Rowe again became concerned and this time spoke to Mr Roxborough, the Principal. She said she was not comfortable having the plaintiff with the juniors. He said he would deal with it and obviously did because the plaintiff then did not come back for the rest of the year. She said that the whole episode of the plaintiff's visits covered about the length of a term but otherwise she could not be more specific in relation to timing. She said she told Ms Blackburn about speaking to Mr Roxborough. Ms Blackburn said that the plaintiff was just being pleasant.""

15Ms Rowe's other observations of Mr Withyman were that, though he was courteous to her, he had behaviour problems and could act inappropriately with other students by fighting, bullying and teasing: [208] of the reasons.

16During the period of these visits or shortly beforehand, in August 2002, Mr Withyman visited Ms Blackburn at her house at 8 pm. Ms Blackburn said in her statement for the IRC proceedings that she was shocked when this occurred, that he had alcohol on his breath, but that after making tea and talking to him he left without trouble. Ms Blackburn reported the visit the next day to the Departmental District Guidance Officer, who told Ms Blackburn to tell Mr Withyman not to do this again, using words suggested to her by the Guidance Officer.

17In 2003, Ms Blackburn was allocated the senior class. This class contained Mr Withyman. She worked a three day week and shared the class with Mr Neal. During the first month of 2003, Ms Blackburn's involvement with Mr Withyman was to drive him to work experience locations: [73] of the reasons. The nature of Mr Withyman's course was to equip him with life skills, not to pass external examinations. Thus, work experience placements were an important part of his learning.

18Mr Withyman visited Ms Blackburn at her home in early 2003. 

19In February or early March 2003 there was a school swimming carnival. There was an incident in which Ms Blackburn and Mr Withyman were, as the latter said in his evidence, ""mucking around at the pool"" and he ""nudged her and she fell in"": [76] of the reasons.

20Following this incident Mr Withyman spoke to Mr Roxborough, who required him on 14 March 2003 to agree to or accept a behavioural contract, some of the content of which was specifically directed to Ms Blackburn. It was read to him. It was as follows:

""I understand that my relationship with all staff is that of a pupil to staff relationship. 

This means that:

● I cannot be alone with any staff member at any time (unless I have approval from my principal or parents), nor invade their personal space (i.e. I must not touch them, visit their homes and not speak to them in an improper manner). 
● When I arrive at school I will start my work and if I need assistance I will ask for help from Mr Neal, Mrs Sweeny and Mrs Luther. 
● From this point on there is to be no contact by me with Miss Blackburn.

I have read the above, it has been explained to me, and I understand what it means."" 

On the document in Mr Roxborough's hand under the heading ""Issues"" the following was written:

""
● Visits to Ms Blackburn's home after being told this was inappropriate and not to happen, as far back as August 2002.
● Inappropriate touching of Ms Blackburn e.g. swimming carnival/pushing teacher into pool.
● Violent outbursts and inappropriate language on a number of occasions e.g. broken windows.""

21Shortly prior to the meeting between Mr Withyman and Mr Roxborough, on 11 March 2003, Ms Blackburn compiled notes of all her interactions with Mr Withyman. The document was two pages long and concluded with a document of a similar character to the behavioural contract that Mr Roxborough drafted. The two page document recounted the contact from 2000, referred to the August 2002 incident and contained the following:

""David has never made 'a pass' at me and has mostly treated me with respect as far as language is concerned.

This year 2003, I was given the Senior Class with Terry Neal and Ross Luther. David made me aware that he liked me and I explained that I am his teacher, which means I have a responsibility to all students to be professional. David understands that is as far as our relationship goes.""

22She described the swimming pool incident as follows:

""During the school swimming carnival, I encouraged all the students to participate in their age races. Other staff and myself got in the water to help with the swimming. David helped me with another student to lift her in and out of the water. He was friendly, as usual but not causing trouble.

In jest David pushed me into the pool. In my experience, this is a very common, although undesirable action at carnivals. Before I had a chance to express myself regarding that, another teacher stepped in.

I observed David to swear at the other teacher and walk off. Jock was called and while we waited for him to arrive, I explained to David that it was wrong to push me in the water even though it was just a joke.

When Jock arrived I observed David to refuse to come with him and swear and act violently towards him. Then afterwards, a number of students and teachers went over to David outside the fence. I was asked to go over to the fence. I asked the students to go away from David and then to David said 'what do you want'. He said 'I want to come back'. I then went over to Terry Neal, the organiser of the carnival and passed this on to him. He said that it was up to Jock now, which I did not know at the time. My observations of my actions and those around me was that the more significant, following incident could have been avoided, had I been allowed to deal with the student myself.

Later David apologised to me for pushing me in the water.""

23The balance of the document sought to convey her professional view as to the better handling of Mr Withyman through personal engagement. The document continued:

""David continues to talk [to] me about his life outside of school and seeks my advice at times. As do many of the students in my care.

At school, I have asked David to be aware that I am his teacher not his friend. 

I choose to mostly ignore minor attention seeking behaviour but react immediately to behaviour which endangers other students. 

David chooses to participate in my groups during group times and complies with my requests to complete work. 

At times, I have heard David swear at other staff. I always comment to him that it is inappropriate to swear but there is little I can do after the words are out.

With all the students who have shown aggression, I spend a great deal of my teaching time suggesting strategies for how they deal with issues in their lives. Other staff would observe me to be joking and laughing with students who are at other times extremely violent and oppositional. They may have missed the fact that my influence over these students is because of my validity with them. They may also miss that the majority of these students complete their work with me when historically, they have refused to work.

As most teachers who have had experience with teaching behaviour disordered students would know, the most successful teaching occurs when the students want to be in the learning situation.

As a professional I am aware that over-familiarity is a problem for teachers who have not been able to exercise classroom management skills and control over the students.

Therefore, I have prepared a document (attached), that David will sign to demonstrate his awareness that he can not be over-familiar with me.""

24The document she created was in the following terms:

""I, David Withyman, will do the following:

● I will not be alone with Miss Blackburn at school
● I will not touch Miss Blackburn while at school
● I will not hold private talks with Miss Blackburn
● I will let Miss Blackburn get on with teaching the whole class
● When I get to school I will start my work. If I have trouble I will ask for help from either Mr Neal, Mrs Luther or Miss Blackburn

I will not be over-familiar with Miss Blackburn.""

25The primary judge found that the sexual relationship commenced ""some time before the end of April 2003 and continued until at least September 2003"": [377] of the reasons.

26Within a week of the acceptance of the behavioural contract to which Mr Withyman agreed and which Ms Blackburn signed, she was directed to drive Mr Withyman to work placements and to conduct a cooking class in which he was a student: [285 (b)] of the reasons. Within a few days of the creation of the behavioural contract, Ms Blackburn was seen watching Mr Withyman play pool in a recreation room. 

27There is some imprecision in the findings as to the time of the commencement of the sexual relationship. The finding at [377] was ""some time before the end of April 2003"". At [285 (c)] the primary judge refers to ""a seduction by [Ms Blackburn] of the student"" two weeks after she wrote the document of 11 March 2003. On the latter finding, the sexual relationship can be seen to have commenced shortly before his 18th birthday in late March 2003. 

28In April 2003, Ms Minato (whom the primary judge described as ""a key witness, if not the key witness, in [Mr Withyman's] case"") had conversations with Ms Blackburn which the primary judge set out at length at [94] of the reasons. These contemporaneous conversations about which Ms Minato gave evidence included statements by Ms Blackburn that she had had sex with someone younger than she who was a student at her school. Ms Minato also said that in early October she said to Ms Blackburn that she had to stop the relationship and that Ms Blackburn had agreed and had said that she knew it was wrong, ""but for whatever reason something keeps drawing me back to him"".

29Other important evidence was from a Ms Mahoney, an intern at the school for 6 weeks in August/September 2003. She gave evidence that Ms Blackburn told her that she had ""a relationship with David [Mr Withyman] outside school""; and that she saw them arguing at school and on another occasion they were chasing each other and laughing. She brought this to the attention of Mr Neal who said ""David's just having nesting problems"", meaning difficulties leaving ""the nest"" being the school, since it was his last term.

30The relationship ended in October 2003 in an ugly scene at Ms Blackburn's house. The police were called. The events are described by the primary judge at [36] - [38]. Two days later Mr Withyman physically assaulted Ms Blackburn; an apprehended violence order was made, and assaults of her later occurred, of which he was convicted and imprisoned.

31The evidence of Senior Constable Erin Lloyd was important. She attended the events of 12 October 2003. She spoke to Ms Blackburn, who made what could be seen to be admissions that are described at [194] - [197] of the reasons.

32In 2007, after she was dismissed, Ms Blackburn commenced proceedings in the IRC alleging wrongful dismissal. The Department sought to justify the termination by reference to the relationship. In the course of these proceedings, Ms Blackburn and Ms Minato corresponded by email. Ms Blackburn requested Ms Minato to swear an affidavit to the effect that she was aware that Ms Blackburn had not had a sexual relationship with Mr Withyman. She repeated the requests. Ms Minato said that she would not do so, because she would not lie. Later Ms Minato received a further email from Ms Blackburn saying that she may be subpoenaed to give evidence. At this point Ms Minato contacted the Department and provided a statement that contained evidence of direct admissions by Ms Blackburn of having sex with Mr Withyman.

The resolution of the controversy by the primary judge

33Mr Withyman succeeded in his case against Ms Blackburn. The claim was found by the primary judge as one of breach of duty, but as one that fell within the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) (the ""CL Act""), s 3B(1)(a), as ""liability in respect of an intentional act that is ... other sexual misconduct"". Thus, the CL Act did not apply to the claim against Ms Blackburn. The primary judge accepted that there had been damage of an emotional or psychological nature - depression and distress, requiring psychiatric treatment. The primary judge awarded $75,000 and interest on a proportion of it. Mr Withyman had also claimed that his later criminal conduct and drug abuse were a compensable and causally related consequence of the breach of duty and the broken affair. The primary judge rejected this and no appeal was brought from that conclusion. The primary judge rejected the whole claim for economic loss: see [433] of the reasons. The primary judge did award aggravated and exemplary damages of $20,000, plus interest. Together with minor sums for out of pocket and future medical expenses, Mr Withyman's judgment against Ms Blackburn was for $120,293.65.

34Ms Blackburn's claim against Mr Withyman for his assaults upon her (which I have not detailed) was successful in large part. She was awarded $69,475, being substantially general damages of $60,000. No appeal lies against this judgment.

35Mr Withyman's claim against the State, both for breach of its own duty of care and for vicarious liability for the actions of Ms Blackburn, was dismissed. Appeal is brought against both of these conclusions. The primary judge assessed damages under the CL Act against the State, on the hypothesis that he was wrong on liability, as $18,433.65. Appeal is brought against that assessment by Mr Withyman, if his appeal is successful on liability. Mr Withyman does not appeal against the award of damages against Ms Blackburn.

Ms Blackburn's appeal

36Mr Jeremy Morris, who appeared for Ms Blackburn, put her appeal both in written and oral submissions. The latter refined and limited the former. In the written submissions there was a general attack on the conduct of the trial arising from Ms Blackburn being a litigant in person. The submission was put that she had been denied procedural fairness. That submission was not pressed orally; and a more focused submission was put about the calling of Ms Minato and the treatment of Ms Minato's evidence.

37Mr Morris put three arguments. First, it was said that while the pleadings were restricted to negligence, submissions were made and the award of damages was made on the basis of an intentional tort or sexual misconduct which was not adequately or properly pleaded. Secondly, it was said that Ms Minato's evidence was dealt with in a way that was not fair to Ms Blackburn and that the finding of sexual misconduct to which it was central should be set aside. Thirdly, it was said that Ms Blackburn had a limitation defence that was not dealt with by the primary judge because of a mistaken view, with which counsel for Mr Withyman and the State concurred, that the issue had been conclusively dealt with by another judge in an earlier interlocutory application.

38For the reasons below, the first two grounds fail and the third succeeds. This necessitates a new trial restricted to the question of the operation of the Statute of Limitations.

The pleading ground

39The essential submission was that the findings that were made were not open on the pleadings. The substantive unfairness in the way the damages were assessed arose from a failure to plead matters outside the CL Act.

40Section 3B(1)(a) of the CL Act provides as follows:

""(1) The provisions of this Act do not apply to or in respect of civil liability (and awards of damages in those proceedings) as follows: 

(a) civil liability of a person in respect of an intentional act that is done by the person with intent to cause injury or death or that is sexual assault or other sexual misconduct committed by the person-the whole Act except: 

(i) section 15B and section 18 (1) (in its application to damages for any loss of the kind referred to in section 18 (1) (c)), and

(ii) Part 7 (Self-defence and recovery by criminals) in respect of civil liability in respect of an intentional act that is done with intent to cause injury or death, and

(iii) Part 2A (Special provisions for offenders in custody).""

41The primary judge concluded, correctly in my view, that the case was one of negligent conduct by Ms Blackburn in her entering into a sexual relationship with Mr Withyman and the intentional physical acts that that involved, in the light of Mr Withyman's vulnerable personality and the foreseeable psychological harm to him at the (inevitable) cessation of the relationship. I will come to the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 73, in due course.

42The original statement of claim was filed in April 2008. Some months later an application was made under the Felons (Civil Proceedings) Act 1981 (NSW) (the ""Felons Act""), s 4, for leave to proceed given that Mr Withyman was in prison at the time of the commencement of the proceedings.

43The argument put by Mr Morris had two elements to it: first, that the pleading was inadequate in terms to permit a claim outside the CL Act; and, secondly, that the proper construction of s 3B(1)(a) meant both that the pleading was inadequate and that the events as found did not satisfy the terms of s 3B(1).

44In my view, the pleading was adequate to raise fairly and squarely a claim outside the purview of the CL Act. The facts, as alleged in the amended statement of claim (being the pleading moved on at the trial), raised squarely the primary factual allegations: the teacher/pupil relationship (para 11), a degree of intellectual disability of Mr Withyman (para 12), the potential operation of the Crimes Act, s 73 (although the pleading in error contained a reference to s 72, repealed well before 2003) (para 13), the degree of authority and intimacy that the teacher/pupil relationship had in these circumstances (para 14), the engagement in an ongoing sexual relationship from March 2003 (when Mr Withyman was 17) to October 2003 (para 18), an asserted lack of consent or informed consent because of Mr Withyman's intellectual disability (para 19), that Ms Blackburn was negligent in having the sexual relationship (para 26) and that the relationship amounted to a sexual assault (particular (c) under para 26). Whilst the second amended statement of particulars identified a multiplier of 5 per cent for damages, which accorded with the requirements of the CL Act, s 14(2), thus indicating a claim under, not outside, the CL Act, the amended statement of claim contained claims (as had the original statement of claim) for aggravated and exemplary damages on the second page of the document under the heading ""Relief Claimed"", which were heads of relief outside the CL Act: s 21. 

45The reference to the Crimes Act, s 72, was clearly an error. Section 72 was repealed on 23 March 1986. It had dealt with attempt carnally to know any girl above the age of ten and under the age of 16 years. Any practitioner upon receipt of that pleading would have understood that it was intended to be a reference to the relevant provision in the Crimes Act concerning sex between a teacher and child. That section was in fact s 73. Before 12 June 2003, s 73 was in the following terms:

""73 Carnal knowledge by teacher etc

Whosoever, being a schoolmaster or other teacher, or a father, or step-father, unlawfully and carnally knows any girl of or above the age of 16 years, and under the age of 17 years, being his pupil, or daughter, or step-daughter, shall be liable to imprisonment for 8 years.""

On and after 12 June 2003, s 73 was in the following terms:

""73 Sexual intercourse with child between 16 and 18 under special care

(1) Any person who has sexual intercourse with another person who: 

(a) is under his or her special care, and

(b) is of or above the age of 16 years and under the age of 17 years,

is liable to imprisonment for 8 years.

(2) Any person who has sexual intercourse with another person who: 

(a) is under his or her special care, and

(b) is of or above the age of 17 years and under the age of 18 years,

is liable to imprisonment for 4 years.

(3) For the purposes of this section, a person (the victim) is under the special care of another person (the offender) if, and only if: 

(a) the offender is the step-parent, guardian or foster parent of the victim or the de facto partner of a parent, guardian or foster parent of the victim, or

(b) the offender is a school teacher and the victim is a pupil of the offender, or

(c) the offender has an established personal relationship with the victim in connection with the provision of religious, sporting, musical or other instruction to the victim, or

(d) the offender is a custodial officer of an institution of which the victim is an inmate, or

(e) the offender is a health professional and the victim is a patient of the health professional.

(4) Any person who attempts to commit an offence under subsection (1) or (2) is liable to the penalty provided for the commission of the offence.

(5) A person does not commit an offence under this section if the person and the other person to whom the charge relates were, at the time the offence is alleged to have been committed, married to each other.""

46Mr Withyman's birthday was in late March 2003. Thus, no criminal offence was or could have been committed by Ms Blackburn. If, however, one assumed that the form of the provision after June 2003 applied prior to June, Ms Blackburn would have been at risk of having committed a criminal offence by having sex with Mr Withyman before his 18th birthday.

47Whilst s 3B itself was not mentioned in the pleading, the clear assertion of all relevant facts made the primary judge's approach to damages entirely appropriate and fair, as long as his construction of s 3B in [384] - [385] of his reasons was correct. In those paragraphs his Honour said:

""The plaintiff's submission is that Ms Blackburn's breach of duty was an intentional tort and thus exempted from most of the CLA. He also submits that if the first defendant is vicariously liable for Ms Blackburn's tort then the first defendant also loses the benefit of the CLA. Section 3B, as relevant, states the damages provisions of the Act do not apply to: 

'(a) civil liability of a person in respect of an intentional act that is done by the person with intent to cause injury or death or that is sexual assault or other sexual misconduct committed by the person...'.

I think the actions of Ms Blackburn were intentional and amounted to ""sexual misconduct."" This means that, all other requirements being satisfied, the plaintiff's damages against Ms Blackburn should be assessed at Common Law and he is eligible for exemplary and aggravated damages. I should add here that, for purposes of Ms Blackburn's cross claim, the assaults upon her and the breaches of AVOs are clearly intentional torts falling within the Section 3B exemption. Therefore any damages to which she is entitled are to be assessed at Common Law. She has also claimed exemplary and aggravated damages.""

48The submissions below and, to a degree, in this Court were misdirected in the characterisation of what occurred as an intentional tort or as a sexual assault. The engagement of the two in the sexual relationship was entirely consensual. Such intellectual impairment as Mr Withyman had was not found by the primary judge to vitiate the consent he willingly gave. On the legislation in place, no crime was committed. No intentional tort was committed, though there were intentional acts. They were not ""done with intent to cause injury or death"", nor were they ""sexual assault"" for the purposes of s 3B(1)(a). Was it, however, ""other sexual misconduct"" by Ms Blackburn? The primary judge thought so. He was correct.

49No discussion of the phrase ""sexual misconduct"" appears in the Review of the Law of Negligence Final Report (September 2002) (the ""Ipp Report""). The meaning of the phrase is to be taken from its text and its place in the CL Act, influenced by any purpose from the text and structure of the Act and any appropriate secondary materials. No secondary materials were identified as relevant to the mischief or purpose of s 3B, beyond that which is implicit in the Act itself. The CL Act contains various provisions designed to ""reform"" the common law, and reduce damages awards. The context and mischief to which the CL Act were directed can be seen from the first paragraph of the terms of reference of the Ipp Report:

""The award of damages for personal injury has become unaffordable and unsustainable as the principal source of compensation for those injured through the fault of another. It is desirable to examine a method for the reform of the common law with the objective of limiting liability and quantum of damages arising from personal injury and death.""

50It is unnecessary to discuss why each of the excisions from the limiting operation of the CL Act set out in s 3B was made. Some excisions are of types of liability having their own particular regime: see, for example, s 3B(1)(d), (e), (f) and (g). Others can be seen to be types of civil liability which should not have any restriction on full common law recovery. Paragraphs (1)(a) and (b) in s 3B are in this category.

51The word ""misconduct"" encompasses the meanings ""improper conduct"" or misbehaviour: see W Little, H W Fowler and J Coulson, The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles, 3rd ed (Clarendon, 1973) vol 2. In conjunction with the adjective ""sexual"" it conveys the meaning of a breach of moral values sufficiently commonly recognised to be called wrong. In Andrew v Andrew [2012] NSWCA 308 at [12] - [13], in the context of legislation concerned with provisions in wills, I said the following as to the place of values and morality in the law:

""Accepted and acceptable social and community values permeate or underpin many, if not most, of the individual factors in s 60(2) and are embedded in the words of s 59, in particular 'proper' and 'ought'. That such values may be contestable from time to time in the assessment of an individual circumstance, or that they may change over time as society changes and grows can be readily accepted. Customary morality develops 'silently and unconsciously from one age to another', shaping law: Benjamin N Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1921) at 104-5. The relationship between law and morals or morality depends, of course, on the context of the enquiry: see for example R Pound, The History and System of the Common Law (New York: Collier, 1939) at 16-21. As Gleeson CJ said in Vigolo at 204 [25], the language of the statute is 'general but value-laden', operating in connection with 'community standards' that will see it given 'practical meaning', that is, to the people and community who and which the law serves.

The values or morality of a civil society underpin or inform, at different levels and in different degrees of abstraction, law at all levels including interpretation of legal (including statutory) rules, evaluative assessment of standards (legal and factual) and discretionary judgments. To the extent that values are expressed by Parliament, they are interpreted and given limits and contours by the courts. Parliament may prescribe relevant factors to be taken into account, but community values are not the monopoly of Parliament. Ultimately they belong to civil society itself, to be ascertained or discerned by courts, whether by interpretation of statute or by the expression of the general law, when the application of judicial power requires it: cf Onus v Alcoa of Australia Ltd [1981] HCA 50; 149 CLR 27 at 42. Such does not obtain only in homogeneous or static societies. Diverse, tolerant and democratic societies governed by law and justice must, even more so, reflect the binding coherence of shared values and assumptions. Difficulty from time to time in accurate contemporaneous expression of such values and assumptions lessens not the need for the values or assumptions to be recognised or applied.""

52Here, in s 3B(1)(a), the Parliament has used a phrase that necessarily requires application of a community moral standard. What its reach is at any given time and place will be a matter for the court to assess. Its limits need not, and should not, be defined, especially by rules drawn up in advance of the resolution of disputes from particular factual circumstances. Some activity that in a past era would have been seen as sexual misconduct, no longer may be so viewed. Here, however, a teacher with responsibilities for the intellectual and emotional care of a vulnerable young man intentionally engaged in a sexual relationship with him. If the Parliamentary calendar had been such as to have led to the amendment of the Crimes Act, s 73 but three months earlier, Ms Blackburn may have been guilty of a crime, if the findings made by the primary judge were to be made by a jury beyond reasonable doubt. The phrase does not require a criminal act as ""sexual assault"" would. The word ""other"" does not in my view require criminality as is implicit within the phrase ""sexual assault"". 

53In these circumstances, I have no doubt that the found conduct was ""sexual misconduct"". 

54Further, as a teacher, Ms Blackburn was bound by a Code of Conduct that was in written form and of which she can be taken to have been aware. The Code required that all staff must:

""i. be conscious of their special duty of care to the students of the NSW public education system in all educational activities in and out of school;
...

xviii. behave in such a manner to protect and enhance the esteem and standing of public education. In particular: 

staff must not, under any circumstances, have sexual relationships with students. 

- It is irrelevant whether the relationship is homosexual or heterosexual, consensual or non-consensual or condoned by parents or caregivers. The age of the students or staff member involved is also irrelevant. 

- Improper conduct of a sexual nature by a staff member against a student includes sexual intercourse and any other form of child sexual abuse (which must be notified) as well as but not limited to the following: 

● Inappropriate conversations of a sexual nature;

● Obscene language of a sexual nature;

● Suggestive remarks or actions;

● Jokes of a sexual nature;

● Obscene gestures;

● Unwarranted and inappropriate touching;

● Sexual exhibitionism;

● Personal correspondence with students in respect of the staff member's sexual feelings for the student; and

● Deliberate exposure of students to sexual behaviour of others, other than in the case of prescribed curriculum material in which sexual themes are contextual; 

- staff must not give students alcohol or other drugs, nor will they encourage or condone the use of alcohol or other drugs by students. They may, however, administer or supervise the administration of prescribed medications consistent with Departmental guidelines. 

- staff must not, under any circumstances, use any form of discipline which involves corporal punishment or engage in any form of behaviour which could cause physical or emotional abuse to students."" 

55These were the clearest requirements of her employer. They also had statutory force, being regulations made under the Teaching Service Act 1980 (NSW), s 100(1). The Code therefore had a status as a form of law. 

56The pleading ground therefore fails.

The complaint about Ms Minato's evidence

57The complaint about Ms Minato's evidence focused on the importance of her evidence, how it came forward and the fairness of the trial in this respect in the light of the primary judge's reasons.

58Ms Blackburn appeared for herself at the hearing. She had previously engaged lawyers for the IRC proceedings, but had run out of money. The primary judge's reasons reveal an acute awareness on his part to alleviate any imbalance that may well arise from experienced counsel (here two silks with juniors, supported by solicitors) pitted against a litigant in person. No complaint was made as to the general conduct of the trial. The complaint concerned Ms Minato's evidence.

59A little further context is necessary. Ms Minato had, in 2008, provided a statement to the Department for use in the IRC proceedings. The statement was direct and unequivocal in its terms that Ms Blackburn had admitted in 2003 to having sex with Mr Withyman. Ms Blackburn could have been under no doubt that Ms Minato's evidence would be used against her interests in the trial. The bundles of documents circulated among the parties prior to and at the trial contained the contentious emails of 2008 (to which I will address further comment below) and Ms Minato's supportive email of 2004. Ms Blackburn must have understood (as the emails to which I will make reference later reveal) that she would have the opportunity to cross-examine Ms Minato.

60Ms Minato was interposed during the evidence of Mr Withyman. We were told on appeal (without demur from the other parties) that Ms Blackburn was told of the coming of Ms Minato on the morning of the day that the latter gave evidence. The transcript does not reveal that any contemporaneous complaint was made about unpreparedness. The primary judge recounted that the interposition was by consent: [92] of the reasons. The primary judge also recorded at [92] that in her submissions Ms Blackburn said that she had not been ready to cross-examine Ms Minato and that a degree of unfairness had arisen. The primary judge did accept that if he had appreciated the significance of Ms Minato's evidence, he would not have allowed her to be interposed. His Honour (with the particular advantage of having run the trial) then said at [92]:

""...However I do not think Ms Blackburn suffered any prejudice. She was able to question Ms Minato with a good deal of 'admissibility' leeway and she made no application to have her recalled for further cross examination. The importance of Ms Minato would also have been evident to Ms Blackburn from Ms Minato's involvement in the Industrial Relations Commission proceedings. I also note that before Ms Minato was called, Mr Marshall said this:

'I'm seeking your Honour's leave to interpose an interstate witness. I have my learned friend, Mr Blacket's consent to that, and I've spoken to Ms Blackburn yesterday. I believe she consents to this course.' (T 405.15)""

61Mr Morris' submissions focused upon the unexplored meaning of a 2004 email from Ms Minato to Ms Blackburn. That email had been sent by Ms Minato to Ms Blackburn on 23 July 2004, shortly before a hearing of the case against Mr Withyman for assaulting and threatening Ms Blackburn. It stated: 

""Goodluck with the court thing. I'll be thinking of you. Remember to tell the truth and know that YOU'VE done nothing wrong!!!! Wish I could be there for you....""

62If Ms Blackburn had ""done nothing wrong"" as Ms Minato had said in that email, how could Ms Minato have been told by Ms Blackburn in 2003 the things in Ms Minato's statement? This was a cross-examination of some technical forensic subtlety to accomplish with the aim of showing that by 2008 the confusion had become embedded in Ms Minato's memory, possibly caused by the salacious publicity that the IRC proceedings had attracted. The point was expressed by Mr Morris at the appeal as follows (see Transcript 14.11.12, p. 22, p. 24):

MORRIS: ""Now that was her state of mind in the IRC. That was her state of mind when it came before the judge but the point is there was a big question as to whether that was her state of mind as at 27 July 2004 on the eve of the trial because she specifically says ""With respect to the deterioration in the relationship between the only two people who were said to be involved in the sexual relationship, just remember tell the truth, you have done nothing wrong."" So the short point is that was there and it was never exploited and it was never even take into - although it was in evidence, it was never taken into account and it tied in with Blackburn's statement to the judge, ""I'm not saying she's telling lies, I'm saying she's either confused or confused about dates. 
...

It isn't just simply a question of saying these conversations didn't take place, right, because the trial judge said these conversations didn't take place. He didn't take it any further than that, he did a rolled up question and left it alone. Now we all know that the trial judge is of course constrained when dealing with a self-represented litigant. The point is the emails from July 2007 were in evidence and they undermine considerably the assertion by Minato about the reason and some of the details of the conversations which were said to have taken place back in April/May 2003 because if she had formed the view that it was unethical, irresponsible in April/May 2003 then on one view her view had changed by July 2004 on the eve of the trial, you have done nothing wrong."" 

63It is necessary to understand how Ms Blackburn conducted the cross-examination and to bear in mind the relevant hypothesis: that she did not have a sexual relationship with Mr Withyman.

64Ms Blackburn was aware of the 2004 email. She put it to Ms Minato in cross-examination: see Black vol 2, p. 558. Ms Blackburn's cross-examination of Ms Minato was not reticent; but she did not expressly challenge her on some of her evidence. This led to the following exchange between the primary judge and Ms Blackburn, which then led to further questions of Ms Minato:

""HIS HONOUR: Well, just before you sit down again. Mr Marshall, you may not want me to ask this question. One of the most significant things that Ms Minato has given evidence about are the phone calls that she says she had with you back in 2003, remember her giving evidence about that? 

SECOND DEFENDANT: Yes. 

HIS HONOUR: Where she has said for example, that you said that you had slept, that it was exciting, something attractive and exciting about being with this younger man. You haven't suggested to Ms Minato that those conversations did not occur. Do you accept that they occurred? 

SECOND DEFENDANT: I think I've asked all the questions I want to ask, your honour. 

HIS HONOUR: Well--

SECOND DEFENDANT: I'm not going to confirm or deny anything which is a conversation between two people that's unrecorded. 

HIS HONOUR: Well, you see, this is the point, if you don't put to her that - if you don't suggest to her that those conversations were not true, then I am left in a position where I am almost bound to accept that they occurred. Do you follow? 

SECOND DEFENDANT: Okay, your Honour, I wasn't aware of that. 

HIS HONOUR: All right. 

SECOND DEFENDANT: But I do put to Ms Minato that the content of the conversations is confused by the past being so long and that the time in which Ms Minato has made those statements about, is not the time that is accurate, sorry, that's two questions but --

HIS HONOUR: Let's just do this --

SECOND DEFENDANT: --but firstly that you may have been confused --

HIS HONOUR: Ms Blackburn, let's just do it this way. Mr Blacket and Mr Marshall will tell me if they object. Do you suggest to Ms Minato that you never said anything to her about having sex with a younger man or having sex with David or anything along those lines? 

SECOND DEFENDANT: I am saying that I never told her that I had sex with David Withyman. A student at the time in March 2003. 

HIS HONOUR: Or any other time? 

SECOND DEFENDANT: Or any other time. I'm also saying that she's confused about the dates. 

HIS HONOUR: Let's just one thing at a time. All right. 

Q. What's being put to you is that those conversations, that you're wrong about them in essence. That she never said that she had sex with this man. She never said there was this younger boy, it was exciting and all of that. What do you say about that? Do you agree --

A. I disagree. 

HIS HONOUR: You disagree? Do you require her to be more specific? 

MARSHALL: No your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: Carry on Ms Blackburn. 

SECOND DEFENDANT: I have no further questions your Honour."" 

65Mr Morris submitted that the blunt ""Browne v Dunn"" question put by the judge to Ms Minato meant that Ms Minato was never taxed by anyone putting the somewhat more subtle proposition identified by Mr Morris. That, however, does not identify error in process or fact-finding by the primary judge. Ms Blackburn was running her own case. Of course that had significant difficulties for her. But the line of cross-examination suggested by Mr Morris, though perhaps subtle and difficult to accomplish, was not complex in conception. It was to a degree obvious that Ms Blackburn should confront Ms Minato with her views in 2004 and to suggest that that reflected the truth and that there was confusion in her 2008 and 2010 evidence. The trial may not have been perfect; but it was as fair as the primary judge could conscientiously make it. Mr Morris referred to the helpful discussion of ""credibility"" by Lord Pearce in Onassis and Calogeropoulos v Vergottis [1968] 2 Lloyd's Rep 403 at 431 as follows:

""""Credibility"" involves wider problems than mere ""demeanour"" which is mostly concerned with whether the witness appears to be telling the truth as he now believes it to be. Credibility covers the following problems. First, is the witness a truthful or untruthful person? Secondly, is he, though a truthful person, telling something less than the truth on this issue, or, though an untruthful person, telling the truth on this issue? Thirdly, though he is a truthful person telling the truth as he sees it, did he register the intentions of the conversation correctly and, if so, has his memory correctly retained them? Also, has his recollection been subsequently altered by unconscious bias or wishful thinking or by overmuch discussion of it with others? Witnesses, especially those who are emotional, who think that they are morally in the right, tend very easily and unconsciously to conjure up a legal right that did not exist. It is a truism, often used in accident cases, that with every day that passes the memory becomes fainter and the imagination becomes more active. For that reason a witness, however honest, rarely persuades a Judge that his present recollection is preferable to that which was taken down in writing immediately after the accident occurred. Therefore, contemporary documents are always of the utmost importance. And lastly, although the honest witness believes he heard or saw this or that, is it so improbable that it is on balance more likely that he was mistaken? On this point it is essential that the balance of probability is put correctly into the scales in weighing the credibility of a witness. And motive is one aspect of probability. All these problems compendiously are entailed when a Judge assesses the credibility of a witness; they are all part of one judicial process. And in the process contemporary documents and admitted or incontrovertible facts and probabilities must play their proper part.""

66These considerations, however, are embedded in the human reaction to, and resolution of, the apparent conflict in the 2004 and 2008 emails. Such was evident to Ms Blackburn. 

67Lest I be wrong about any error in process, I would conclude that there has been no miscarriage of justice necessitating a new trial on this point. An examination of the email correspondence in 2008 leads me to the tolerably clear conclusion that there was no error in the finding by the primary judge that Ms Blackburn and Mr Withyman had had a sexual relationship.

68Ms Blackburn asked Ms Minato whether she would provide an affidavit in the IRC proceedings. The first request was by email on 22 July 2008. The email included the following:

""I need a statement from you saying that you and I were very close during 2003 and to your knowledge I was not in a sexual relationship with David Withyman. I also need you to describe the times that you did see David, that he came to my house unannounced and refused to leave with out a lot of coercing when you were there in early October 2003."" 

69Ms Minato did not reply. On 18 August, Ms Blackburn sent her another email, saying the following:

""I have just spent 2 days with a barrister in Sydney and find myself having to defend my actions of 2003. I wonder if you would want to do the same?

Well I guess the fact that you haven't tried to contact me means that you don't really want to help me in this situation. Well I can understand that but you have been mentioned in both mine and David's statements and if I can't get a statement from you then you will probably be served with a subpoena from the Education Department and will be called as a witness against me.

....

Once again I need a statement from you which says that when you met David he had arrived unannounced at the house when you were there and that he had to be coerced into leaving, a description of the house where you were and that we talked at length about most personal matters, that you would have known if I was in a sexual relationship with David and that I wasn't and that I told you that I was really worried about what he would do to stop him from contacting me.

.... 

I attach my affidavit so far so you can see what I have written. I know this request demands a true act of friendship from you but my alternative is to allow them to proceed without trying to defend myself. I am so happy for you that you have found love and stability. I am sure you want the same for me. 

Anna

PS Paul reads my emails usually before I do.""
(emphasis in original)

70Paul was, I infer, Ms Blackburn's partner. The draft affidavit that was enclosed (or that was sent shortly afterwards) contained the following paragraphs:

""11. Throughout the material period I never observed Anna with David on any occasion apart from the time he turned up unannounced at Anna's house in late September or early October 2003.

12. On that occasion I observed that Anna was surprised to see David at her house and at no time did I observe any intimate contact or anything that suggested to me that Anna and David had conducted a sexual relationship during the preceding 6 months.

13. Over a long period of time Anna and I have confided in each other about many personal issues including intimate relationships we have had with third parties. 

14. I am aware that David Withyman has alleged that he and Anna were engaged in a sexual relationship throughout the material period. I certainly had no knowledge of such a relationship at any time during the material period.

15. Had Anna engaged in a sexual relationship with David Withyman she would have disclosed that to me. At no time did Anna ever mention that she had any sexual relationship with David during the material period or any other time.""

71At 1:13 pm on 1 September 2008, Ms Minato sent an email to Ms Blackburn as follows:

""You realise that you're asking me to straight out lie and deny any knowledge of what went on seemingly without a second thought? That you're dropping me right in the middle of this and asking me to go against my principles....... 

I'm not really prepared to sign anything knowing that it is not truthful Anna. You should know me better than that - that my conscience is bigger than that....... I want to support you as much as I can but to go against the person that I am.......

I still have some confusion in my mind about what you've written also.

This is not as simple as what you're trying to make out. I shouldn't have to apologise for this but I'm sorry I'm really struggling and I have to say that I'm not very happy.

Can't do this at the very minute.""

72Ms Blackburn sent a reply at 2:29 pm on the same day. The email is long but powerfully revealing:

""Dear Diana,

Sorry to take up your time in your job but just in case you forgot.. I DON'T HAVE A JOB AND COULD [sic: could not] GET ONE WITH CHILDREN IF I TRIED BECAUSE THEY'VE PUT ME ON A LIST NOT TO WORK WITH KIDS. HOW FAIR IS THAT?

Well all my care of you in the past also has been wasted.

Thanks a lot. I know it's not simple and I have not asked it for five years because I have wanted to keep everyone out of it but if I can say again.

It cost me my career and I didn't care but now the price for not defending myself is too high. I've already sold two properties to cover the legal costs and I can't tell you what it's doing to my self esteem and how it's affecting how I am with Norah and Katherine. 

You may as well have said this has been my fault. Isn't that what you are thinking? 

This guy's father is the governor of the local jail. This is his defence for violent criminal behaviour. It's a big fat excuse for him to get away with hurting women. 

If I don't have affidavits from my supposed close friends and supposedly supportive family denying what he is alleging then I will face criminal charges and the Department of Education has grounds to sue me as well as the family of this arsehole. Would you like to see the truth.. on how he locked me in my house and bashed me? Or when he drove me off the road and bashed me and bit my nose so that it almost came off my face, when he grabbed me and bashed me another time in front of my office, when he came at me with his fists outside the bank in a busy street or when he brought a loaded rifle around to the house and was about to shoot us?

I guess you think I don't really deserve to have a life where I don't have to look over my shoulder every day. Because I do Diana. I look over my shoulder wherever I go. I live in fear that he will just keep trying to hurt me.

Or what about your truth and your principles? How do they stand up Diana? I've been happy to defend you and stay loyal and supportive and would happily defend your actions as it has related to your relationships. So now I know just where I stand with you.

I get it. But don't pretend to be my friend OK.

Your letter

You realise that you're asking me to straight out lie and deny any knowledge of what went on seemingly without a second thought? That you're dropping me right in the middle of this and asking me to go against my principles....... What did you actually see? Anything? And what principles? Oh the ones where we don't defend our friends' rights to live life in peace and the ones where we can bring something bad to an end but don't have the balls to go through with it.

I'm not really prepared to sign anything knowing that it is not truthful Anna. You should know me better than that - that my conscience is bigger than that....... I want to support you as much as I can but to go against the person that I am....... I don't know you at all. All those hours of phone calls when you were depressed over Chris and Mark and when you were single were just bullshit. I know that now. I am just sorry that I confided my feelings and my deepest wishes and thoughts in you. I am so deeply hurt that what I have confided in you is to be used against me. 

I still have some confusion in my mind about what you've written also. What I wrote is true. What don't you get it?*

This is not as simple as what you're trying to make out. I shouldn't have to apologise for this but I'm sorry I'm really struggling and I have to say that I'm not very happy. You sound like you are disappointed in me? Are you joking?

Can't do this at the very minute. Well I've only got until next week and if I don't have a statement signed by you then in November when the case runs you will probably be asked by the Department of Education to recall your interactions with me and with him. If you do sign a statement then it is unlikely you will be cross-examined and with all the other statements as well, it is likely the DET will reassess their own evidence. You understand at this point they have nothing except for his accounts of what happened to suggest that there was a sexual relationship. There are NO EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS AND NO FORENSIC EVIDENCE. Only what I say and what he's said and some phone records."" 
[Asterisk added, but italics and capitals in original.]

73Mr Morris said that one reason that Ms Blackburn may not have wanted directly to confront Ms Minato over the change from 2004 (on the continuing hypothesis of no sexual relationship having occurred) was that she did not want to upset someone who could help. But the angry and betrayed tone in an email full of confrontation contradicts that argument. The bitterness about Mr Withyman's violence is evident, and understandably so. But nowhere is there a clear denial of any sexual act. Rather, the bitterness that a friend will not help her by stating what is necessary. The ""pleading"" to the email of Ms Minato is damning. Subject to how one reads the line with the asterisk, there is no statement to the effect: ""You know that there are no lies in the draft affidavit."" Rather, there is evident bitterness about this favour not being done for a friend. The last comment is particularly revealing. It seeks to persuade Ms Minato that if she will sign a statement, it is unlikely that she will be cross-examined since Ms Blackburn says that there is no objective evidence to prove that anything occurred. This last entry, especially that in capitals, conveyed to Ms Minato that if she said what was asked of her there could be no contrary proof. This is not how a person innocent of the act would likely finish in the exchange. 

74The reference to possible criminal charges can be inferred to be a reference to s 73 earlier referred to. Ms Blackburn's bitter desperation for help is at no time expressed to be founded on mutually known and appreciated innocence. 

75The overwhelming inference is that this email is fundamentally inconsistent with Ms Blackburn being innocent of participation in a sexual relationship with Mr Withyman in 2003.

76The second ground of appeal therefore fails. 

The Statute of Limitations Ground

77This requires close attendance to the procedural chronology.

78In April 2008, Mr Withyman filed his statement of claim. On 30 June 2008, he filed a notice of motion seeking leave to institute proceedings under the Felons Act, s 4, which was in the following terms:

""A person who is in custody as a result of having been convicted of, or found to have committed, a serious indictable offence may not institute any civil proceedings in any court except by the leave of that court granted on application.""

79The motion was called on for hearing on 20 August 2008. Both defendants (the State and Ms Blackburn) sought leave to appear given the terms of s 7 of the Felons Act, as follows:

""At the hearing or determination of an application or appeal under this Act, except by the leave of the court to which the application or appeal is made: 

(a) the applicant or appellant, as the case may be, is not entitled to appear in person, and

(b) the person who would, if the proceedings to the institution of which the application or appeal relates were instituted, be the defendant in those proceedings, is not entitled to appear or be represented.""

80On that day, McLoughlin DCJ gave a short extempore judgment and granted leave for the State and Ms Blackburn to appear. 

81The issue before McLoughlin DCJ was whether leave should be granted. The purpose of the leave provision was as set out in Patsalis v State of New South Wales [2012] NSWCA 307 at [4]:

""The purpose of the leave provision was to ameliorate the perceived harshness of the doctrine of attainder. The leave requirement was also to prevent abusive proceedings: see s 7 and generally the Second Reading Speech of the Attorney General (New South Wales Parliamentary Debates, 1980-1981, Third Series, Vol 160 at 4813-4814).""

It was in this statutory and forensic context that the issues were to be litigated.

82In that context, the defendants sought to show that the proceedings were abusive because they were statute barred. One of the matters that Mr Sergi took objection to in the debate about whether leave should be given was that the defendant ""seeks ... to turn this into some form of mini hearing of the merits of the case"": Transcript, 20 August 2008, p.8 (30). Mr Sergi correctly identified the limitation question as not one requiring a discretionary extension of time but the pleading of the cause of action and a defence being put on by reference to the new limitation period of three years from discoverability: Limitation Act 1969 (NSW), ss 50A-50F (Pt 2 Div 6). Of particular relevance are ss 50A, 50C, 50D and 50F which are in the following terms:

"" 50A Application of Division-kinds of causes of action

(1) This Division applies to a cause of action for damages that relate to the death of or personal injury to a person, regardless of whether the claim for the damages is brought in tort, in contract, under statute or otherwise.

(2) This Division applies only to causes of action where the act or omission alleged to have resulted in the injury or death with which the claim is concerned occurs on or after the commencement of this Division (as inserted by the Civil Liability Amendment (Personal Responsibility) Act 2002).

(3) This Division does not apply to a cause of action on a claim under the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999.

(4) This section extends to a cause of action that: 

(a) is a survivor action, or

(b) is a compensation to relatives action.

....

50C Limitation period for personal injury actions

(1) An action on a cause of action to which this Division applies is not maintainable if brought after the expiration of a limitation period of whichever of the following periods is the first to expire: 

(a) the 3 year post discoverability limitation period, which is the period of 3 years running from and including the date on which the cause of action is discoverable by the plaintiff,

(b) the 12 year long-stop limitation period, which is the period of 12 years running from the time of the act or omission alleged to have resulted in the injury or death with which the claim is concerned.

(2) For the purposes of the application of the 3 year post discoverability limitation period to a survivor action, the cause of action is taken to be discoverable by the plaintiff at whichever is the earliest of the following times: 

(a) the date on which the cause of action is discoverable by the deceased if the cause of action is discoverable by the deceased more than 3 years before the death of the deceased,

(b) the appointment of the plaintiff as the deceased's personal representative if the cause of action is discoverable by the plaintiff at or before the time of that appointment,

(c) the date on which the cause of action is discoverable by the plaintiff if the cause of action is discoverable by the plaintiff after the appointment of the plaintiff as the deceased's personal representative.

(3) For the purposes of a compensation to relatives action, the 12 year long-stop limitation period runs from the death of the deceased.

50D Date cause of action is discoverable

(1) For the purposes of this Division, a cause of action is discoverable by a person on the first date that the person knows or ought to know of each of the following facts: 

(a) the fact that the injury or death concerned has occurred,

(b) the fact that the injury or death was caused by the fault of the defendant,

(c) in the case of injury, the fact that the injury was sufficiently serious to justify the bringing of an action on the cause of action.

(2) A person ought to know of a fact at a particular time if the fact would have been ascertained by the person had the person taken all reasonable steps before that time to ascertain the fact.

(3) In determining what a person knows or ought to have known, a court may have regard to the conduct and statements, oral or in writing, of the person.

(4) To remove doubt, a compensation to relatives action is not discoverable before the date of death of the deceased.

....

50F Effect of disability on limitation period

(1) If a person has a cause of action for which a limitation period has commenced to run and the person is under a disability, the running of the limitation period is suspended for the duration of the disability.

(2) A person is under a disability while the person: 

(a) is a minor, but not while the minor has a capable parent or guardian, or

(b) is an incapacitated person for a continuous period of 28 days or more, but not while the person is a protected person.

(3) In determining when a cause of action is discoverable by a person who is a minor, or an incapacitated person, who is not under a disability, facts that are known or ought to be known by a capable parent or guardian of the minor or the guardian of the incapacitated person are taken to be facts that are known or ought to be known by the minor or incapacitated person.

(4) In this section: 

capable parent or guardian of a minor means a person who is a parent or guardian of the minor and who is not under a disability (as referred to in subsection (2)).

guardian of a minor includes a person who under a written law of the State is exercising the parental responsibilities of the Minister under the Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act 1998 for the minor.

(a) any disease or any impairment of his or her physical or mental condition, or

(b) restraint of his or her person, lawful or unlawful, including detention or custody under the Mental Health Act 1990, or

(c) war or warlike operations or circumstances arising out of war or warlike operations.

protected person means: 

(a) a person in respect of whose person another person is guardian, whether under the Guardianship Act 1987 or any other Act or law, or

(b) a person in respect of whom an order is in force under the NSW Trustee and Guardian Act 2009 or the Guardianship Act 1987 that the estate (or any part of the estate) of the person be subject to management under the NSW Trustee and Guardian Act 2009.

(5) Sections 52 (Disability) and 53 (Notice to proceed) do not apply to a cause of action to which this Division applies.""

83Having granted the defendants leave to appear, McLoughlin DCJ heard argument on the motion under the Felons Act. It is only necessary to examine how the parties treated the limitation question. After evidence was led, on 30 September 2008 (Black vol 1, p. 23) the judge asked what had to be established on the motion. Mr Sergi, for Mr Withyman, answered (substantially correctly) as follows:

""SERGI: A prima facie case your Honour. Your Honour has to be satisfied there's a prima facie case.

HIS HONOUR: That's all that's got to be established?

SERGI: Yes your Honour, yes your Honour ...""

84The judge then proceeded on that basis. Mr Parker (for the State) accepted that framework saying (Black, vol 1, p. 25):

""PARKER: In my submission it would be an abuse of process for two reasons. One is, the proceedings are out of time unless this person is incapable of managing his affairs.

HIS HONOUR: So you say that it would be an abuse of process if the plaintiff had -

PARKER: If the plaintiff was capable of providing instructions and doesn't require a tutor, then these proceedings are out of time.

HIS HONOUR: Well it may or may not be, but are there any orders sought in respect of that?

PARKER: No your Honour, remember your Honour will recall this was raised on the first hearing date before your Honour.""

The question of a relationship between the limitation question and the appointment of a tutor had already been raised. On 20 August 2008, Mr Parker had said to the judge (Black, vol 1, 1M):

""PARKER: One of the issues in the case is whether the plaintiff is disabled or not, whether he requires a tutor.""

85Mrs Withyman, who had been appointed as tutor, was cross-examined by Mr Parker (for the State) on 30 September. He asked her questions seeking to distinguish a learning disability from an intellectual disability, such matters being relevant to the question of discoverability. Medical evidence was also tendered by the defendants.

86In addressing the judge in the afternoon of 30 September, Mr White (for Ms Blackburn) commenced by directing himself to the limitation question, as follows (Black, vol 1, pp 61 - 62):

""WHITE: Your Honour, in the statement of claim, the plaintiff relies upon section 50F of the Limitation Act to extend the usual three year period of discoverability which is under section 50D for the filing of his claim. And relies upon the fact that the plaintiff was under a disability in respect of being an incapacitated person as defined in section 50F(4) of the Act. In other words your Honour, the second limb of section 50F(2) that the plaintiff was under a disability in that he is an incapacitated person is the reason why this statement of claim was filed outside the usual three year period. Now it's my understanding your Honour that in relation to the application, the plaintiff's motion that the leave be granted in that he needs to show that it's not an abuse of process, it's the second defendant's submission that unless he can be shown to have filed his statement of claim within time it will amount to an abuse of process and oughtn't be ...""

This recognised that the threshold was abuse of process.

87Submissions then took place as to whether there was a disability, including submissions on the medical evidence. In addressing the medical evidence on that question, the following exchange took place between the judge and Mr White (for Ms Blackburn) (Black, vol 1, p. 65):

""HIS HONOUR: Is that issue just one on prima facie basis?

WHITE: Well, yes, I think so, your Honour, yes.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, under the legislation.""

Thus, the matter was still being addressed (correctly) as one of a prima facie view or whether it was an abuse of process. To view the matter thus, in effect, only required the plaintiff to persuade the judge that the likely defence under Part 2 Div 6 of the Limitation Act may not succeed, that there was a prima facie case for the plaintiff. If, of course, on the application, the defendants were able to persuade the judge that the limitation defence was bound to succeed, it would be open for the Court to conclude that there was no prima facie case in that it would be an abuse of process to allow it to proceed.

88Mr Parker (for the State) put his submissions on the limitation question as the plaintiff being out of time. For the reasons just discussed, to succeed in resisting leave, he had to put it categorically. He also submitted that Mr Withyman did not need a tutor: Black vol 1, pp. 77-78. But Mr Parker clearly accepted that the matter was to be approached on a prima facie basis. In discussing discoverability, the following exchange took place between the judge and Mr Parker (Black, vol 1, p. 78):

""HIS HONOUR: But again I take it it's a question on a prima facie basis.

PARKER: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: The onus being on the plaintiff?

PARKER: Yes your Honour ...""

89Then Mr Sergi (for Mr Withyman) addressed the judge. He began by correctly characterising the relevant parts of the defendants' arguments, as follows (Black, vol 1, p. 84):

""HIS HONOUR: Both the defendants say there's no prima facie case because (1) he's not disabled in accordance with the legislation and (2) is the question of he's outside the three year period.

SERGI: They seem to be the issues. I will come to them -

HIS HONOUR: And (3) Mr Parker submits that it's not - the conduct - the relationship is not tortious.

SERGI: Yes.""

The judge accepted this (Black, vol 1, p. 84):

""HIS HONOUR: They are the three main areas as I see the defendant's submissions.""

90McLoughlin DCJ delivered judgment on 19 November 2008. Before analysing the terms of that judgment, the following is clear from the history of the application under the Felons Act that I have set out. First, the issue was one of a threshold point: Was the claim an abuse of process or was there a prima facie case? Secondly, all parties, at all times, accepted in argument that the issue was one of the stated threshold point. Thirdly, there was no suggestion that the plaintiff's motion under the Felons Act was being supplemented by some undocumented motion to try a substantive issue in a case that had not been granted leave. Indeed, defences were not filed until 2009.

91In a judgment carefully rehearsing the evidence, at pp 15ff his Honour recited the submissions about the relevant sections of the Limitation Act and Mr White's submission that the evidence did not disclose a disability. At pp 18ff the judge recorded Mr Parker's submission that the ""matter is out of time"". At pp 20ff the judge recorded Mr Sergi's submission that the injury was not discoverable until the receipt of Ms Robilliard's report on 8 January 2008. At pp 27ff the judge dealt with the limitation question. It can be accepted that his language was consistent with a resolution of the issue. At pp 34-35 his Honour said the following (White, pp. 43 - 44):

""In those circumstances I am well satisfied the plaintiff would not have been aware of any serious injury until he was assessed by Ms Robilliard and would not have been in a position to determine the fault of the second defendant until some person was in a position to point out to him that teachers had a duty of care not to commence an emotional or physical relationship with a student, more so when student is somewhat psychologically impaired and suffer from behaviour problems. The plaintiff did not recognise this during the term of the relationship and when the history is given does not really appear to have understood that until recent times. As it is the plaintiff must know each of the facts set out in sub paras A, B and C and I am of the view the plaintiff did not know each of those facts until receipt by his solicitors of the report by Ms Robilliard in February 2008.

I have dealt with the proposition that has been put that there was enough for the plaintiff to have done more to ascertain the proposition before that time, in my view there was not. When one looks at the psychiatric opinion that I have expressed and the impairment with which the plaintiff suffered I do not accept those propositions. Accordingly I am well satisfied that the cause of action was not discoverable as referred to under s 50D of the Limitation Act until February 2008 and there is no defence available to the defendants pursuant to the provisions of the Limitation Act.""

92From the context I have given, it is plain that it was no part of the resolution of the motion for a decision to be made that a limitation defence would fail or failed. Rather, if the defendants could show that such a defence must succeed, it could be concluded that the institution of the proceeding was an abuse. No party argued the matter beyond it being necessary for the plaintiff to show that he had a prima facie case that was not an abuse of process in the context of the possibility of a limitation defence. The judge's reasons for the interlocutory order granting leave to proceed must be examined in that light.

93On 20 March 2009, the State filed a defence which pleaded that the claim was statute barred.

94On 2 April 2009, Ms Blackburn filed a defence without the assistance of a legal practitioner. It was a document of some pages that told her side of the story, denying any sexual relationship. It did not plead a limitation defence. On 16 September 2009, Ms Blackburn, now legally represented, filed an amended defence which pleaded that the claim was statute barred.

95On 22 February 2010, the plaintiff filed an amended statement of claim which once again pleaded facts relevant to the operation of the Limitation Act.

96There was no reply to the defences.

97On 15 May 2009, McLoughlin DCJ dismissed a motion brought by Ms Blackburn to remove Mrs Withyman as tutor.

98The matter was called on for hearing on 15 February 2010. Ms Blackburn was present and unrepresented. On the morning of the first day, the primary judge asked Mr Marshall, senior counsel for Mr Withyman, whether there was still a limitation point or whether it had been dealt with. Mr Marshall said (Black, vol 1, p.115):

""MARSHALL: We say it has been dealt with implicitly by Judge McLoughlin in earlier proceedings.

HIS HONOUR: Right"".

Mr Marshall continued (Black, vol 1, pp.115 - 116):

""MARSHALL: Your Honour may need to look at the transcript for that. In those proceedings, Judge McLoughlin made orders that the plaintiff have leave to proceed, that a section of the Felons Act did not amount to a bar to proceedings. To do that, he had to satisfy himself that there was a valid course of action available to the plaintiff.

HIS HONOUR: But there hasn't been a hearing specifically dedicated to the limitation question? I mean in other words, you haven't had a motion asking for leave to proceed out of time--

MARSHALL: No.

HIS HONOUR: --or the defendant hasn't put on a motion saying you can't proceed because it's out of time?

MARSHALL: No. But the point was, I'm told by Mr Sergi who appeared on the motion, argued at length before Judge McLaughlin.

HIS HONOUR: All right.""

99Mr Bridge, senior counsel for the State, then took issue with this, saying (Black, vol 1, p. 116): 

""BRIDGE: We take issue to that, your Honour.""

100The parties then considered their position. Further discussion took place (Black, vol. 1, pp. 121 - 122):

""HIS HONOUR: At first blush I would prefer to get on with the oral evidence but I must say I'm very concerned about the limitation point. From the point of view of whether there is a point or not, because I think that will effect the evidence. I will effect -

BRIDGE: It will from our perspective - I didn't want to interrupt my friend, but quite obviously your Honour, we will be on one view - your Honour will see that there is an issue in the pleadings about whether the plaintiff is disabled within the terms of the Tutor provisions and also within the terms of Limitation provisions. Both matters are put in issue in the pleadings now.

HIS HONOUR: There were some notions weren't there about removing the Tutor -

BRIDGE: I don't know about -

SECOND DEFENDANT: That's correct, your Honour, I put forward a motion.

HIS HONOUR: You had a motion to remove the Tutor.

SECOND DEFENDANT: I had a motion to remove the Tutor, yes.

HIS HONOUR: And what happened?

SECOND DEFENDANT: It was dismissed by McLoughlin DCJ.""

101On the morning of the second day, Mr Bridge raised the matter with the primary judge. The following exchange took place (Black, vol 1, p. 141):

""BRIDGE: Your Honour, in relation to the limitation issue, I have read the judgment, I can't raise that point.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, I thought it was a clear issue estoppel, Mr Bridge, I read it again over night.

BRIDGE: It's helpful to read the judgment, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Okay, thank you for that. That will apply also to the second defendant.

BRIDGE: I haven't raised it with her.

HIS HONOUR: The limitation issue that we were talking about yesterday, Mr Bridge has said that he cannot raise it. Do you have a different position?

SECOND DEFEDANT: Yes. I concurred. I have very little legal knowledge but I would imagine one judgment is made in the court, the following judgment can't be made in the same court, is that correct or am I mistaken?

HIS HONOUR: That's called issue estoppel, thank you for that. Yes, what about the pleadings then?""

102On the appeal, Ms Norton SC sought to maintain this position against Ms Blackburn. The State (if I may say so, perfectly properly) did not seek to resile from the position it took at the trial. Mr Morris, on behalf of Ms Blackburn, did seek to resile from it.

103For the following reasons, the primary judge erred in his conclusion that the issue had been resolved in circumstances leading to an issue estoppel. Equally, counsel was wrong. Ms Blackburn was (of course, not intentionally) misled in this regard and should not be held to the error.

104In Blair v Curran [1939] HCA 23; 62 CLR 464 at 531 - 533, Dixon J said:

""A judicial determination directly involving an issue of fact or of law disposes once for all of the issue, so that it cannot afterwards be raised between the same parties or their privies. The estoppel covers only those matters which the prior judgment, decree or order necessarily established as the legal foundation or justification of its conclusion, whether that conclusion is that a money sum be recovered or that the doing of an act be commanded or be restrained or that rights be declared. The distinction between res judicata and issue-estoppel is that in the first the very right or cause of action claimed or put in suit has in the former proceedings passed into judgment, so that it is merged and has no longer an independent existence, while in the second, for the purpose of some other claim or cause of action, a state of fact or law is alleged or denied the existence of which is a matter necessarily decided by the prior judgment, decree or order.

Nothing but what is legally indispensable to the conclusion is thus finally closed or precluded.

...

The difficulty in the actual application of these conceptions is to distinguish the matters fundamental or cardinal to the prior decision or judgment, decree or order or necessarily involved in it as its legal justification or foundation from matters which even though actually raised and decided as being in the circumstances of the case the determining considerations, yet are not in point of law the essential foundation or groundwork of the judgment, decree or order."" (emphasis added)

105There is no doubt about the continuing application of the distinction made by Dixon J in Blair v Curran: Murphy v Abi-Saab (1995) 37 NSWLR 280 at 288. 

106Further, in Kuligowski v Metrobus [2004] HCA 34; 220 CLR 363 at 373ff, the Court (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ) applied what Lord Guest had said in Carl Zeiss Stiftung v Rayner & Keeler Ltd (No 2) [1967] 1 AC 853 at 935:

""(1) that the same question has been decided; (2) that the judicial decision which is said to create the estoppel was final; and, (3) that the parties to the judicial decision or their privies were the same persons as the parties to the proceedings in which the estoppel is raised or their privies.""

At 375 [25] the Court referred to finality as follows:
A ""final"" decision, then, is one which is not of an interlocutory character, but is completely effective unless and until rescinded, altered or amended. The fact that an appeal lies from a decision does not make it any less final. It must be ""final and conclusive on the merits"": ""the cause of action must be extinguished by the decision which is said to create the estoppel"".

107For one purpose, the decision to grant leave under the Felons Act is clearly interlocutory in that it does not finally decide the rights of the parties. But the conception of finality for these purposes of issue estoppel may be different. Is it completely effective (as an order granting leave) unless or until it was set aside on appeal?: Somodaj v Australian Iron and Steel Ltd [1963] HCA 50; 109 CLR 285 at 298; Kuligowski at 374 - 375 [25] and 379 [39]. See also Maurice Blackburn Cashman v Brown [2011] HCA 22; 242 CLR 647 at 662 [40]. In Maurice Blackburn the question was of the finality of a decision (an opinion) of a medical board. It was not final because its determinacy went no further than the Act itself. Here, the decision which it is necessary to characterise as final or not is the decision to grant leave. Whether or not it is final in the relevant sense, the issue determined must have been legally indispensable for the decision. It was not. It was not a necessary or an indispensable part of the reasoning founding the grant of leave under the Felons Act to conclude that the action was not statute barred. The legal foundation for the leave to be granted was only that the claim was prima facie arguable and not an abuse of process in the face of the length of time since the events. No defence had been filed. No resolution of a joined issue was before the Court. The only issue decided between the parties was that the proceedings were not an abuse. 

108It was argued that the parties had chosen to elevate a factual issue to a point and to an extent that placed it before the judge for disposition. There are two answers to that. First, from the terms of the argument that I have set out, the parties only ever approached the matter on a prima facie basis. The application began and ended with the express recognition of that from all counsel. The judge went beyond the argument and the issues before him for disposition.

109Secondly, given that issue estoppel is limited to what is legally necessary or indispensable, and that the fact of the matter not being statute barred does not fall into that category, any estoppel would have to be of a different type flowing from the conduct of the litigation: Commonwealth v Verwayen [1990] HCA 39; 170 CLR 394. No such estoppel was pleaded. It was not what the primary judge or, apparently, counsel relied upon.

110During the appeal, Mr Morris filed in Court an amended notice of appeal dated 16 November 2012. For the reasons given above the appeal should be allowed on ground 11, that the primary judge erred in not determining Ms Blackburn's defence under the Limitation Act. The appeal otherwise fails. The consequence of this is that there needs to be a new trial limited to the limitation defence. It was accepted that this Court could not undertake this task. We did not have the relevant material that was before McLoughlin DCJ, and, more importantly, primary factual findings have not been made at a trial about the issues.

111As to costs of the appeal, Ms Blackburn has been successful in setting aside the judgment against her, but she failed on some issues. The problem arose (and I do not say this critically) in part because of the error of Mr Marshall. In these circumstances it is just and appropriate for Ms Blackburn to have the costs of the appeal. The costs of the first hearing should abide the result of the hearing on the limitation point and be within the power of the judge hearing the matter to award.

112The remitter should be to the primary judge. On the views that I have expressed, his Honour made no error other than the failure to deal with an issue. The parties (other than Ms Blackburn) led him into that error. Evidence was not called that was directed to that issue. It is true that findings in the nature of demeanour and credit findings have been made about Mr Withyman and his mother. None of those findings was attacked. It appears appropriate that the same judge finalise the issues that were before him, even though he has come to views on the evidence so led. This, however, is not a bar to any application that may be made before the primary judge if the matter is before him.

113The orders that I propose in Ms Blackburn's appeal are:

1. Appeal allowed.

2. Set aside the judgment for the plaintiff against the second defendant in the sum of $120,293.65 and set aside the order for costs against the second defendant.

3. Remit the matter to Elkaim DCJ (or if this is not possible to another judge of the District Court) to hear and dispose of the defence of the second defendant (the appellant, Ms Blackburn) under the Limitation Act 1969, such remitter to be limited to such issues, by way of completion of the hearing before the District Court.

4. The first respondent (Mr Withyman by his tutor Glenda Ruth Withyman) pay the appellant's costs of the appeal.

5. The first respondent to have a certificate under the Suitor's Fund Act 1951 (NSW).

6. The costs of the trial to date be decided by Elkaim DCJ (or such judge who hears the remitter) in the light of the disposition of the issues on remitter.

Mr Withyman's appeal 

114Mr Withyman's appeal was only directed against the State. Given the sum that the primary judge would have awarded, Mr Withyman's appeal requires leave to appeal under the District Court Act 1973 (NSW), s 127(2)(c). The argument on the appeal was heard concurrently with the application for leave to appeal. 

115The matter is one of significant seriousness. The misconduct of Ms Blackburn had an effect on Mr Withyman and arose from circumstances that reflect a degree of discredit (to adopt and paraphrase the Code of Conduct) on Ms Blackburn, and potentially on the State if it should be viewed as partly responsible. For these reasons, leave to appeal should be granted on the grounds asserting the State's liability. The appeal however, for the reasons expressed below, should be dismissed. 

116Leave was also sought to challenge the quantum of damages assessed by the primary judge should he be wrong on liability. For the reasons shortly given later, I would not grant leave on that issue. The primary judge carefully considered and absorbed the evidence relevant to that topic. His views should not be interfered with. The asserted errors are doubtful and even if present would not substantially vary the award to a point worthy of granting leave. 

The liability appeal

The State's own duty and asserted breach

117Grounds 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the draft notice of appeal can be dealt with together. They all concern the complaint that the State breached its non-delegable duty of care. 

118The State undoubtedly owed a duty of care to Mr Withyman. Some argument concerned the content of that duty. It can be accepted that the content of the duty required employees of the State - the Principal, Mr Roxborough, the Deputy Principal, Ms Churches, and the other staff - to be alive to the best interests of the students and to the proper conduct and behaviour of students and colleagues. 

119The primary judge's findings and reasoning to the effect that the State did not breach its duty of care can be found at [393] - [414] of the reasons. The primary judge accepted that the school was to a point lax in enforcing the behavioural contract to which Mr Withyman agreed in March 2003, by directing Ms Blackburn to drive him to job placements. Ms W had been sexually assaulted by Mr Withyman in earlier years. Crucial, however, to the primary judge's conclusions was the following expressed at [402]: 

""The whole of the evidence leading up to the Behaviour Contract demonstrates a concern for the welfare of the teacher. It is not aimed at the plaintiff's wellbeing. I have criticised the school in relation to the Mrs [W] incident not out of any dereliction of duty to the pupil but rather because of the failure to meet the teacher's concerns. Similarly the genesis of the behaviour contract lies not in the protection of the pupil. It had, at its core, the protection of Ms Blackburn.""

120In essence, I agree with his Honour's conclusions in this regard. Detailed written submissions and careful and helpful oral argument from counsel for Mr Withyman and the State analysed the evidence of what happened at the school in 2003, and in earlier years. There were interviews and statements from the teachers at the school taken in the course of the Departmental investigation. There was also the documentary evidence. To a significant degree, the assessment of what the State, through the other teachers, should reasonably have perceived is a matter of evaluation and emphasis. What impression should they have obtained if reasonably alert to the behaviour of Mr Withyman and Ms Blackburn, up to April 2003, when the sexual relationship had begun? Ms Norton, during argument, said that when one looked at everything said by the teachers in their interviews and statements, the ""vibe"" was that something inappropriate was or should have been evident. Ms Norton put it thus, and if I may respectfully say, perceptively so, because of the entire absence of observation, at least up to April 2003, of facts that should have alerted the staff to any interest of Ms Blackburn in Mr Withyman. 

121It would lengthen inordinately this judgment to traverse all the matters of emphasis and inference from the various events and exchanges. The following matters are crucial, however, to understanding the correctness of his Honour's conclusions. 

122The possibility of a sexual relationship between a young teacher and a 17 or 18 year old student is not of itself far-fetched or fanciful. The possibility of personal and sexual relationships between teachers and students is real. That, however, does not mean (the CL Act, s 5B) that it is foreseeable that there is a not insignificant risk against which a reasonable person would take precautions that any teacher will engage in sex with a pupil. If the State were to be found liable it was necessary to establish that the facts before, and evident to, those at the school were such as to make it reasonably foreseeable that there was a risk that the teacher/student relationship between Ms Blackburn and Mr Withyman may become consensually sexual. 

123Mr Withyman had been overtly sexually aggressive to Ms W in the past. He had shown interest in Ms Blackburn. He came to her classes uninvited. He had come to her home uninvited after school hours in August 2002 with alcohol on his breath, and may have gone to her house in early 2003. He pushed her into the pool at the school swimming carnival. That Mr Withyman as an emotionally vulnerable, volatile and at times aggressive, and at times overtly sexually aggressive young man, may have posed a possible threat to a young 29 year old female teacher can be accepted. According to one teacher, Mr Neal, Mr Withyman considered himself ""God's gift to women"". The matter was put with clarity by Mr Ray, the Departmental investigator, in his conclusion:

""The potential serious consequence of David's increasing infatuation with Ms Blackburn was well recognised by her supervisors. Mr Roxborough's input into the wording of the behaviour management contract leaves no doubt as to his intentions - it was directed as much to Ms Blackburn as David. As such, Ms Blackburn's disregard for the contract as established in points a - h of the allegation is clear indication that she acted without concern for David's fragile emotional/behavioural development or the disrepute that her actions could bring to the school and the Department. As such, the conduct as alleged is considered misconduct."" 

124The crucial question, however, is what was apparent or reasonably perceptible about Ms Blackburn's response to Mr Withyman and his evident liking for Ms Blackburn. 

125A reasonable appreciation of Ms Blackburn's teaching style is crucial to this. In this regard, the interviews of Mr Roxborough and Ms Churches are important. Both said that she had a degree of firmness of view that a method of being friendly and showing interest in the children was best. Ms Churches said Ms Blackburn's attitude was that she knew best. Ms Churches said to her that Mr Withyman's conduct was inappropriate. This was a warning to her about him, not a warning that her (Ms Blackburn's) conduct was inappropriate. Ms Blackburn's response that she could help Mr Withyman, even if he was behaving inappropriately, was perceived by Ms Churches as her stubborn insistence and her teaching style. Her view was that Ms Blackburn had high integrity and was extremely caring. Ms Churches did make some remarks in her interview about Ms Blackburn being attractive, wearing mini-skirts and low cut tops and Mr Withyman being ""quite a good looking kid"". Ms Churches was not called. From the context of these remarks they may contain an element of musing in hindsight. Whether that is accurate or not, nowhere in Ms Churches' interview is there revealed a body of facts or an appreciation of facts which should reasonably have led Ms Churches to appreciate that there was a foreseeable risk that Ms Blackburn would consent to a sexual relationship. 

126Much was made of the fact that only a day or two after the behaviour contract in March 2003, Ms Blackburn was seen watching Mr Withyman playing pool in the recreation room. According to Ms Churches in her interview Mr Roxborough was furious with Ms Blackburn when he observed this. I will not set out the text of what Ms Churches said, but the essence was that she was, to a degree foolishly putting herself at risk - that he was a young, very strong, very volatile, very aggressive young man ""and you should never be alone with him"": Blue, vol 1, p. 341. Mr Roxborough was not asked about the same incident, but there is no basis to think that Ms Churches' view on the incident was not his view as well. 

127Mr Roxborough described Ms Blackburn as idealistic and naïve, and, to a degree, inexperienced. These are the considerations that permitted Mr Ray to say that the behaviour contract was as much for Ms Blackburn as it was for Mr Withyman. It was essential that she appreciate the importance of Mr Withyman keeping his distance because of the perceived danger to her, not to prevent her advances towards him. 

128The behaviour contract was preceded by the memorandum from Ms Blackburn. This set out in an apparently professional way Ms Blackburn's approach to, and concerns about, Mr Withyman. It provided no foundation for a conclusion that the school should have foreseen a risk of her sexual misconduct.

129The later conduct in August of playfully running between the bushes, was well after the relationship had started. Also, it is likely to be vested with hindsight to say that it reflected behaviour mutually overly familiar that should have been seen earlier. 

130Criticism was made of the school for failing to enforce the behavioural contract by informing Mr Withyman's parents. Mr Roxborough considered that but drew a conclusion at the time that there may be trouble if he did so. That was a reasonable judgment call. 

131Mr Withyman's senior counsel at the time, Mr Marshall, described Ms Blackburn's conduct as an ""act of madness"". Reading the interviews of the teachers, that appears to be a fair statement. ""Madness"" is one way of putting it. The growth and movement of emotions, infatuation and desire can be unpredictable, swift and unforeseen. Such is the human condition. There is no basis, however, for the State to be criticised for failing to perceive the developing confluence of these emotions in Ms Blackburn. It was not reasonably foreseeable. The State was not negligent. 

Vicarious Liability

132The accepted non-delegable duty of the State is to be determined as if the liability were the vicarious liability of the State for the negligence of Ms Blackburn: the CL Act, s 5Q. 

133The primary judge dealt with this at [415] - [418] of his reasons. Though brief, the primary judge's remarks went to the heart of the matter at [416] - [417]: 

""For purposes of examining the possible vicarious liability of the school, and perhaps generally, Ms Blackburn's actions must, I think, be regarded as sexual abuse. The fact that the plaintiff was such a willing participant does not prevent this conclusion in the light of his immaturity, vulnerabilities and presence in a school for children with special needs. The Chief Justice in New South Wales v Lepore (2003) 212 CLR 511 did contemplate a circumstance where there might be vicarious liability:-

""It cannot be said that the risk of sexual abuse ought to be regarded as an incident of the conduct of most schools, or that the ordinary responsibilities of teachers are such that sexual assaults on pupils would normally be regarded as conduct (albeit serious misconduct) within the scope of employment. However, there are some circumstances in which teachers, or persons associated with school children, have responsibilities of a kind that involve an undertaking of personal protection, and a relationship of such power and intimacy, that sexual abuse may properly be regarded as sufficiently connected with their duties to give rise to vicarious liability in their employers.""

Although a teacher at Carenne might have been called on to perform certain acts approaching intimacy with a student, they would have been restricted to students with particular physical or mental disabilities and not to a student like the plaintiff whose disabilities did not require such conduct. I do not think that the responsibilities of Ms Blackburn as the plaintiff's teacher were such as to create circumstances of the type described by the Chief Justice and which might give rise to a vicarious responsibility. 

It is trite to say that the school was not vicariously liable for Ms Blackburn conducting a sexual relationship with the plaintiff because this activity was outside the scope of her employment.""

134The appeal was conducted on the basis that the guiding principles were to be found in New South Wales v Lepore [2003] HCA 4; 212 CLR 511. It was uncontroversial that the relevant principles were fully and pellucidly stated by Gleeson CJ in Lepore at [40] - [74]. 

135Vicarious liability is imposed for a tort committed in the course of or within the scope of employment. If the act is authorised by the employer, the employer will be liable. The difficulty is in the consequence of unauthorised acts: [40] - [42] of Lepore. Unauthorised acts will found vicarious liability if they may be regarded as modes (although improper modes) of carrying out employment duties; but if the act is unconnected with the authorised act it may be independent: [42] where Gleeson CJ referred to the well-known test from Salmond on the Law of Torts (see J W Salmond, The Law of Torts: a Treatise on the English Law of Liability for Civil Injuries, 5th ed (Sweet & Maxwell, 1920). The Chief Justice, however, at [51]ff discussed some of the limitations of the Salmond test. One difficulty was the degree of generality with which the authorised acts are defined. The Chief Justice said at [52]:

""When the specific responsibilities of an employer relate in some way to the protection of person or property, and an intentional wrongful act causes harm to person or property, then the specific responsibilities of a particular employee may require close examination.""

136Speaking of schools, the Chief Justice said at [53]: 

""It is the element of protection involved in the relationship between school authority and pupil that has given rise to difficulty in defining the circumstances in which an assault by a teacher upon a pupil will result in vicarious liability on the part of a school authority. The problem is complicated by the variety of circumstances in which pupil and teacher may have contact, the differing responsibilities of teachers, and the differing relationships that may exist between a teacher and a pupil. Some teachers may be employed simply to teach; and their level of responsibility for anything other than the educational needs of pupils may be relatively low. Others may be charged with responsibilities that involve them in intimate contact with children, and require concern for personal welfare and development. The ages of school children range from infancy to early adulthood. Although attendance at school is compulsory for children between certain ages, many secondary school students remain at school for several years after it has ceased to be obligatory."" 

137The Chief Justice then referred at some length and with evident approval to the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Bazley v Curry [1999] 2 SCR 534. Bazley was a case in which a man worked in a residential facility for the treatment of emotionally troubled children. He was required to perform parental duties from general supervision to intimate functions such as bathing and tucking in at bedtime. He sexually abused a child. The employing organisation was held liable. At [56] - [57], Gleeson CJ cited the following passages from the judgment of McLachlin J (as her Ladyship then was):

""[56] McLachlin J, who delivered the judgment of the Court, examined the considerations of policy underlying the concept of vicarious liability, and said: 

""Underlying the cases holding employers vicariously liable for the unauthorized acts of employees is the idea that employers may justly be held liable where the act falls within the ambit of the risk that the employer's enterprise creates or exacerbates. Similarly, the policy purposes underlying the imposition of vicarious liability on employers are served only where the wrong is so connected with the employment that it can be said that the employer has introduced the risk of the wrong (and is thereby fairly and usefully charged with its management and minimization). The question in each case is whether there is a connection or nexus between the employment enterprise and that wrong that justifies imposition of vicarious liability on the employer for the wrong, in terms of fair allocation of the consequences of the risk and/or deterrence."" 

[57] Later, McLachlin J elaborated her views on the concept of sufficiency of connection, saying: 

""The fundamental question is whether the wrongful act is sufficiently related to conduct authorized by the employer to justify the imposition of vicarious liability. Vicarious liability is generally appropriate where there is a significant connection between the creation or enhancement of a risk and the wrong that accrues therefrom, even if unrelated to the employer's desires."" (emphasis in original)

138The Chief Justice continued at [58]: 
""Factors to be taken into account, relevant to sexual abuse, were said to include the opportunity for abuse afforded to the employee, relationships of power and intimacy, and the vulnerability of potential victims. The focus of the test for vicarious liability for an employee's sexual abuse was said to be ""whether the employer's enterprise and empowerment of the employee materially increased the risk of the sexual assault and hence the harm"".

139In ground 5 of the draft notice of appeal, Mr Withyman sought to draw himself within these principles. The ground was expressed as follows: 

""His Honour erred in failing to find that because of the special needs of the Appellant the relationship with the Second Respondent was a relationship of such power and intimacy as to give rise to vicarious liability in the First Respondent."" 

140The argument was that Ms Blackburn's employment included the emotional development of students in circumstances which invested the student/teacher relationship with a high degree of power and intimacy. The students were vulnerable and had special needs. There was therefore a sufficient connection with the creation and enhancement of risk. 

141The first answer of the State to this was that this was a departure from how the case had been run before the primary judge. There is significant force in that argument. In his address, Mr Marshall, senior counsel for Mr Withyman, said the following: 

""That he came to her house, they had alcohol together, and then in a moment of absolute madness on her part they had sex, because here she is saying to the school, ""Look, this is what's been happening. I myself don't see it as a particular problem. This is the way that I teach, this is the way that I deal with people."" But the school - this special school - ought to have known this is difficult. There are problems here. This is a touchy-feely sort of school, we have lots of physical interaction going on with our students. They are special students, they don't fit into mainstream category.""

142No attempt was made in the evidence to focus in detail upon the duties of a teacher such as Ms Blackburn in building emotional bonds with students. It can be accepted that Ms Blackburn's teaching style had a degree of gentle, forgiving familiarity with her students. That, however, is not a factor that promotes a risk of sexual intercourse. 

143That the children at the school were or may have been more emotionally vulnerable than ordinary school students may perhaps be accepted. But the enterprise of teaching and guiding the young, even using gentle and forgiving familiarity does not create a new ambit of risk of sexual activity. Sexual activity is as divorced and far from the gentle caring teacher's role as it is from the stern, detached disciplinarian's. The connection and nexus was not such as to justify imposition on the State for Ms Blackburn's, apparently out of character, sexual misconduct. The school did not create or enhance the risk of such by her duties. 

The quantum appeal

144Ground 6 of the draft notice of appeal was in the following terms: 

""His Honour erred in his assessment of the Appellant's damages in the following respects:

(a) that in accordance with s 16 of the Civil Liability Act 2002, the Appellant's non-economic loss was just 20% of a most extreme case. 

(b) That the Appellant suffered no past economic loss. 

(c) That the Appellant suffered no diminution of his future earning capacity nor was the Appellant otherwise reasonably entitled to a 'buffer' for future economic loss."" 

145The findings on damage that are contained in the primary judge's reasons at [424] - [437] must be read in the light of the primary judge's detailed and careful analysis of the medical evidence at [302] - [359] of his reasons. The evidence of Dr De Saxe, Ms Robilliard, Dr Allnutt, Dr Roberts, Dr Samuels, Dr Corbett-Jones, Ms Johnson and Dr Frukacz and hospital records were carefully analysed. The trial lasted 28 days. The expert testimony of Mr Withyman's psychiatric state and the emotional and psychological consequences of the break-up of the relationship bore closely on each other. In this respect, the primary judge had the advantage of the contemporaneous absorption over time of related and interconnected evidence. Though the primary judge's conclusions on medical questions did not depend on demeanour, the review of his Honour's conclusions should be approached in accordance with the principles discussed by Beazley JA, Basten JA and myself in Gett v Tabet [2009] NSWCA 76; 254 ALR 504 at [10] - [22].

146The first sub-ground of this ground, the complaint about the assessment by the primary judge of 20 per cent of a most extreme case, faces the formidable difficulty of the applicable standard of review. Reference only need be made to Crystal Wall Pty Ltd v Pham [2005] NSWCA 449 at [49] and Wynn Tresidder Management Pty Ltd v Barkho [2009] NSWCA 149. In Wynn Tresidder, McColl JA (with whose judgment Tobias JA and Young JA agreed) said the following at [110] - [111]: 

""The approach taken when an appellate court is asked to review a primary judge's conclusion as to the severity of a plaintiff's non-economic loss by reference to a ""most extreme case"" was discussed in Crystal Wall Pty Ltd v Pham [2005] NSWCA 449 (at [49]) as follows:

""49 The exercise in which the primary judge was involved in determining non-economic loss is neither scientific nor normative. While it is not wholly at large, it involves an exercise of discretion with which the Court will rarely intervene: Southgate v Waterford (1990) 21 NSWLR 427 at 440. Having regard to the nature of the exercise, a finding that a particular case is or is not 'a most extreme case' has been said to be not 'readily ... susceptible of appellate review' as 'its resolution ... involve[s] questions of fact and degree, and matters of opinion, impression, speculation and estimation calling for the exercise of common sense and judgment': Dell v Dalton (1991) 23 NSWLR 528 at 533 per Handley JA (with whom Kirby P and Priestley JA agreed); Rabay v Bristow [2005] NSWCA 199 at [62] - [67]. Unless it can be demonstrated that the trial judge has erred in the application of principle, in order to attract appellate review it will be necessary to show that the conclusion reached by the primary judge was manifestly erroneous: Ellis v Rantzos (t/as Rantzos Hairdressing) [2005] NSWCA 266 at [43] per Basten JA (with whom Handley and Santow JJA agreed).""

A like approach has been taken by the West Australian Court of Appeal: see Hammond Worthington v Da Silva [2006] WASCA 180; Den Hoedt v Barwick [2006] WASCA 196; (2006) 46 MVR 30; Insurance Commission of Western Australia v Weatherall [2007] WASCA 264."" 

147The only specific error pointed to by Mr Withyman was the conclusion at [430] that he had ""substantially recovered"" from the depths of despair to which he had sunk. The written submissions identified specific parts of the medical evidence in support of the submission. A review of all the medical evidence does not make good the ground. The primary judge used the word ""substantially"". That allowed for a recognition of a degree of residual anger in Mr Withyman about which the doctors speak. The judge, however, had to disentangle the emotional and psychological effects of incarceration, and of the other facts on Mr Withyman's mental state. I am not persuaded of any legitimate argument that his Honour fell into error. Even if he did, the sum involved would be minor; one could not legitimately increase the 20 per cent by anything other than a nominal amount. I would refuse leave to appeal on sub-ground 6(a). 

148Nor has any foundation been shown for the interference with past or future earning capacity from the emotional distress brought about by the break-up of the relationship. He was undoubtedly badly emotionally distressed. But he was a violent, volatile and aggressive young man prone to alcohol, drugs and violence. His propensity to be violent led to his imprisonment. No appeal was brought against the primary judge's conclusion as to the lack of causal connection between his criminality and the breach of the duty of Ms Blackburn. 

149I would not grant leave to appeal on sub-grounds 6(b) and (c). 

150The orders that I propose in respect of Mr Withyman's appeal are as follows: 

1. Grant leave to appeal on grounds 1 - 5 set out in the draft notice of appeal in the White Book. 

2. Dispense with the need to file any notice of appeal.

3. Refuse leave to appeal on ground 6 set out in the said draft notice of appeal. 

4. Dismiss the appeal with costs. 

Other process

151The State sought leave to cross-appeal in respect of the decision of McLoughlin DCJ on leave under the Felons Act. It also sought leave to appeal against the primary judge's assessment of contribution of 50 per cent instead of 100 per cent indemnity. 

152The first matter was abandoned. The second does not arise. 

153The applications for leave to appeal and cross appeal by the State should be dismissed. 

154MEAGHER JA: I have had the benefit of reading the thorough and measured reasons of Allsop P. I agree with those reasons and the orders that he proposes.

155WARD JA: I agree with Allsop P.

2707166,R v Morrison [2013] NSWDC 334,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Andrew Morrison appears today for sentence in relation to an offence of armed robbery contrary to s 97(1) Crimes Act 1900, committed on 2 November 2011 at Glenfield Park in the State of New South Wales, when he did rob Alissa Michelle Mainwaring of certain property, namely $536.55, the property of The Reject Shop Limited, being armed with an offensive weapon, namely, a knife. That offence carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. There is no standard non-parole period for it.
	
	
	Related to that offending are three other offences, an offence of taking and driving a conveyance without the consent of the owner, contrary to s 154A Crimes Act 1900, which when dealt with summarily, as I am required to approach the matter as it is on a s 166 certificate, carries a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment and/or a fine of $5,500. There is another offence of driving in a manner dangerous, which carries a maximum penalty of nine months imprisonment and/or a $2,200 fine, with a minimum period of disqualification of 12 months.
	
	
	A third offence on the s 166 certificate is an offence of driving whilst unlicensed and never having been licensed which carries a monetary penalty of a maximum of $2,200. Because these matters are on an s 166 certificate I will be required to impose sentences upon the prisoner in relation to those matters
	
	
	They have not attracted much attention in the course of submissions and in the circumstances of the matter, noting of course Pearce v R (1998) 194 CLR 610, particularly in the majority judgment at [45], and cases subsequent to that decision, particularly in the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, I have concluded that any penalties I should impose involving a term of imprisonment should be concurrent with the sentence that I impose in relation to the armed robbery given their intimate connection to that offence.
	
	
	Again it has not been expressly addressed but clearly can be impliedly understood that the criminality in the armed robbery includes consideration of matters relating to the taking of the vehicle and the conduct of the vehicle, to impose the terms of imprisonment that I must impose, notwithstanding s 5 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, those terms will thus be concurrent.
	
	
	I have a statement of agreed facts in relation to some of the offences, particularly the taking of the motor vehicle and the offence of armed robbery which was charged on indictment. The prisoner, as at 2 November 2011 was resident in Wagga, but on parole, having been released to parole in September 2011 having served over five years of a term of imprisonment imposed by his Honour Judge Coorey.
	
	
	He was residing in premises in Bluett Crescent, Mount Austin, and according to the facts, as I understand the matter, he asked a young man staying at the prisoner’s residence if that young man knew how to get to the Southcity Shopping Centre. The prisoner and his companion walked to address in Tolland. The prisoner approached a motor vehicle, the subject of the take and drive without the owner's consent charge, which was a white coloured two-door Hyundai Excel.
	
	
	He entered the driver's seat of the vehicle, told his companion to get into the passenger seat. The person with him saw the prisoner break the steering lock of the vehicle and hotwire the car. The prisoner drove the vehicle to the shopping centre and eventually parked the motor vehicle in a nearby carpark. He retrieved a baseball bat from his tracksuit pants and the young man that was with him waited in the motor vehicle.
	
	
	The prisoner disappeared from sight and was absent only a matter of minutes, and the male companion heard loud screaming. The screaming was as a result of the armed robbery that the prisoner had committed. The victim of the armed robbery was an employee of ‘The Reject Shop’ in the shopping centre. At approximately 2.15 to 2.20pm that day she was working one of the cash registers or ""tills"", having started work at about 1pm.
	
	
	The prisoner walked into the shop and walked towards her. When he got close to her he ran around behind her and grabbed her by you shoulders with his left hand, he spun her around so that she was facing away from him and he had his front to her back, and held a knife to her neck region. In the agreed statement of facts the knife was estimated to be approximately 20 to 23 centimetres in length and about 5 to 5 and a half centimetres wide at the base.
	
	
	The knife was held close to her neck, a matter of a few centimetres away, and the prisoner kept a firm grip on her and said, ""Open the till, get the money out. I want the money."" The victim told him that she could not do it. Another employee came to her aid having heard the victim scream. She saw the prisoner holding the victim and the prisoner yelling, and heard him say, ""Open it. Open in."" She told him she would open it and indicated there were difficulties because it couldn't be done without a sale.
	
	
	The prisoner was said by the witnesses to become agitated. The victim herself said, ""She's almost got it. She's almost got it."" The prisoner let go of the victim when the till was open and she fell from his grip, so to speak. The prisoner put his hands in the till and pulled out the tray containing the money. He called out as he walked away holding the tray and the knife, ""Don't call out or I'll hurt youse."" He then left the store.
	
	
	As part of the evidence in the sentence proceedings I have seen the closed circuit television footage of the armed robbery which shows effectively two views, one in a close up of the actions of the prisoner. The prisoner, on the view one has of the closed circuit footage, approached the victim purposefully. He took a firm grip on her and held the knife, as the facts state, close to her throat, and clearly during the period of time he was making demands to gain access to the contents of the ""till"".
	
	
	It can be fairly said of course that the time that he had the victim in his grip was a matter of perhaps no more than 15 seconds. But one can see the affect of the prisoner's conduct on the victim after he left as she was visibly shaking and had to be consoled by one of the witnesses. As I said, the prisoner acted purposefully and deliberately and it is clear from the closed circuit television that the prisoner knew exactly what he was doing and was prepared to do what he needed to do to effect his purpose.
	
	
	Of course, whether he needed to produce a knife and hold it against the throat of a vulnerable victim is another matter, but that is what he chose to do. The prisoner drove off eventually in the car that he had previously taken, and there are some facts in relation to the offence of driving in a manner dangerous, and of course any driving of the motor vehicle constituted the offence of driving whilst never licensed.
	
	
	He drove around the Mount Austin area and eventually to an area of Glenfield, a suburb of Wagga. The police were no doubt looking for the subject vehicle. It eventually was followed by police, and in the course of that ""pursuit"" he drove on the incorrect side of a roundabout at Glenfield Road and travelled along Glenfield Road on the incorrect side of the road, overtaking vehicles, his manner of driving causing other vehicles to flash their headlights and move out of the way onto the shoulder of the road to prevent a collision. He eventually turned into Redhill Road, to the south of Tolland, and eventually police lost sight of the vehicle.
	
	
	He drove the vehicle into Tolland and abandoned it and it was later recovered by the police. The prisoner was subsequently arrested. He was interviewed by police some time after 5.51pm. The agreed statement of facts simply said that he denied committing the offence, but in the context of the prisoner's evidence today, the ERISP was tendered and I will deal with the details of that when I deal with the prisoner's evidence, but it must be said that the prisoner gave a ""coherent"" account of himself and a detailed account of his movements throughout the day in his denial of having committed the armed robbery, which the police were then investigating.
	
	
	The prisoner pleaded guilty at the December sittings of the court when the matter was listed for trial. The prisoner has given evidence about some aspects of the circumstances of the giving of the plea, but as was conceded in the written submissions of the prisoner's counsel, the discount to recognise the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty could be no more than 10% in light of the judgment of Thomson and Houlton, and I am prepared to provide the prisoner with a discount of 10% upon the otherwise appropriate sentence in relation to the indictable offence.
	
	
	Likewise, I will give an appropriate discount to the summary matters, although that is academic given the fact that they will be, where prison sentences are required, sentences of imprisonment to be served concurrently with the non-parole period that I fix for the prisoner.
	
	
	The prisoner was, as I mentioned earlier, on parole. This was a matter of considerable significance in these sentencing proceedings. Not just because the prisoner by being on parole when he committed this offence was in breach of conditional liberty, but because the prisoner's offending in a number of respects, and his conduct and attitude towards the offence, bears striking similarity in many respects with matters for which he has previously been sentenced and in respect of which he was on parole at the time of the commission of the offences with which I am concerned.
	
	
	Also, the evidence of the prisoner and submissions that are made, in the context of the medical evidence, reflect upon lost opportunities to endeavour to sever the Gordian Knot of the prisoner's clear institutionalisation having spent many years in custody, admittedly arising out of the commission of serious crimes whilst an adult.
	
	
	The prisoner was born on 13 April 1978, according to the criminal history available to the Court. He was thus at the time of the commission of the offences of which I am concerned, on my calculation, 33 years of age, and is now 34 years of age, about to turn 35. Commensurate with his history of dysfunction and neglect as a child he has appearances in the Children's Court for various offences relating to matters of dishonesty, stealing of motor vehicles and misuse of motor vehicles and the like.
	
	
	As an adult he first appeared in a Local Court for an offence of breaking and entering with intent and received on that occasion a three year good behaviour recognisance as it then was known under s 558 Crimes Act 1900, and subsequently, over a year later, received a community service order and another recognisance to be of good behaviour for three years for receiving stolen property.
	
	
	Ultimately and inevitably he was sentenced to terms of imprisonment in 1998 for crimes of dishonesty, including the take and driving of a motor vehicle without the owner's consent. These were relatively short periods of imprisonment imposed in 1998 in the Manly Local Court, and also just previously in the Fairfield and Liverpool Local Courts. He reappeared in the Local Courts in 1999 and was again sentenced to a relatively short term of imprisonment for breaking and entering a building and committing the indictable offence of stealing, and given concurrently, recognisances to be of good behaviour for 15 months.
	
	
	He continued to offend, however, and was sentenced to terms of imprisonment in 2000 for offences relating to his misuse of motor vehicles and taking and driving a vehicle without the owner's consent, totally, as I understand, 18 months with a non-parole period of 12 months. He was convicted at the Campbelltown District Court on 12 December 2001 for various offences relating to robberies, two offences in company, one offence of using an offensive weapon to avoid apprehension and another offence of driving a conveyance without the consent of the owner.
	
	
	Those terms of imprisonment extended, so I understand, the sentences imposed by the learned sentencing judge, from 12 December 2001, in total, through to February 2006. A non-parole period was fixed, recognising the special circumstances although the sentences involved themselves, some accumulation. It should be noted that the prisoner was sentenced in relation to two robberies in company at that time.
	
	
	The prisoner did not obtain parole. There is evidence available that firstly, his parole was delayed and then by the time he was offered parole, he said in his evidence today that he determined to serve out the rest of the sentence with only six months to go. Shortly after his release he then committed a series of offences that were dealt with by his Honour Judge Coorey at the Campbelltown District Court on 18 February 2008.
	
	
	These offences involved a course of conduct by the prisoner between 27 February 2006 and early March 2006. They involved offences of knowingly drive a conveyance without the owner's consent, committed on 25 February 2006, an offence committed on 27 February 2006, a ""quite aggravated robbery"", involving the infliction, as I understand it, of actual bodily harm, obtaining a benefit by deception and driving whilst disqualified, on the same date. Also, robbery whilst armed, with wounding, committed on 28 February 2006, obtain benefit by deception and drive whilst disqualified on 1 March 2006, and robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon and driving whilst disqualified on 5 March 2006. On 11 March 2006 the prisoner committed another offence of taking and driving a motor vehicle without the consent of the owner, and driving whilst disqualified.
	
	
	The prisoner was arrested shortly after that date in relation to other matters and he was questioned several days later in respect of the matters with which his Honour Judge Coorey dealt. I have not only the agreed statement of facts, but his Honour's remarks on sentence and a medical report and a psychological report that were prepared for the proceedings and have been re-tendered in these proceedings.
	
	
	In relation to those remarks on sentence, of course there are a number of common features with the current circumstances of the prisoner. Many of the subjective circumstances have remained much the same and of course there are parallels between the character of offending and the prisoner's subsequent conduct in 2006 with the matter with which I am concerned. His Honour structured the sentences, as I understand it, in such a way as to make a number of sentences concurrent with each other.
	
	
	Ultimately, his Honour fixed a total sentence of seven years and six months with a non-parole period of three years and six months, reflecting a finding of special circumstances on the basis of the material available to him. I should point out the prisoner's traffic record is before me. He has never been licensed as I have pointed out, and has committed a large number of offences consistent with that, including many offences of driving whilst disqualified, most recently, when he was at large in early 2006.
	
	
	The agreed statement of facts also set out the details of the information the prisoner provided to the police in respect of the investigations they were undertaking in respect of the number of crimes that the prisoner is alleged to have been concerned with. There are some parallels between the prisoner's obfuscation on that occasion and the obfuscation in the interview the prisoner gave to police in relation to the matter with which I am concerned. As I earlier pointed out, the prisoner was released to parole on or about 12 September 2011. He came to Wagga to be with his partner who had two young children.
	
	
	According to the Probation and Parole Service report that was tendered it was the case that the prisoner whilst on parole, up until the time of the offending with which I am concerned, generally complied with the directions of the Probation and Parole Service, had managed to avoid the use of illicit drugs, which had been a feature or factor in his previous offending on a number of occasions, and was receiving medical treatment.
	
	
	With regard to his supervision by the Probation and Parole Service, the report I have notes that whilst he did not present any problems for the Probation and Parole Service up until the commission of these offences, the period of supervision of course was relatively short and his past history, including past parole supervision, reflected the inability of the prisoner to maintain a lawful lifestyle. On numerous occasions whilst subject to community supervision the Probation and Parole Service report sets out some details of his previous supervision and breaches of his conditional liberties in the past.
	
	
	He was in breach of parole in 2000 and his parole was revoked on that occasion. He did not eventually seek parole on the occasion he was in custody between 2001 and 2006, and because of his breaches in November 2011 his parole was revoked. With regard to the revocation of his parole which occurred in mid November, my understanding is that the balance of parole which he is required to serve, subject to further direction from the parole authority, is for a term of three years, ten months and 11 days, commencing from 2 November 2011, the date he came back into custody. That period of balance of sentence will expire on 12 September 2015.
	
	
	Jumping ahead somewhat to one of the matters raised in the submissions of the accused particularly is the issue of commencement date of sentences I am required to impose for the matters that require sentencing today. In that regard I am drawn to a number of judgments of the Court of Criminal Appeal, DW [2012] NSWCCA 66, and particularly at [79], the judgment of Simpson J in Callaghan v R [2006] 168 A Crim R 145, and the earlier judgment of Kitchener [2003] NSWCCA 134.
	
	
	I am mindful, particularly, amongst the number of matters that are raised from the authorities and included in the submissions for the accused, that one must be careful in fixing a sentence for offences where a breach of parole is an aggravating factor not to ""double dip"" to and extent that is unfair to the prisoner. I have noted what was set out in the written submissions in relation to the discretion that exists in the circumstances that I am faced with in this particular matter. I am mindful of the need, amongst other things, to include the period spent in custody since 2 November in the consideration of the fixing of an appropriate non-parole period for the prisoner for the sentences I must impose.
	
	
	I have concluded ultimately that the commencement date of any sentences I impose should be 2 October 2013, which I calculate to be one year and 11 months since the effective revocation of the parole to which the prisoner was subject, which is slightly less than 50% of the balance of sentence otherwise required to be served, mindful of the fact of course that, but for these matters but assuming other breaches of parole, the prisoner may be entitled to release to parole during that period of time.
	
	
	In any event, returning if I may to the Probation and Parole Service report, the Probation and Parole report reflects upon matters of the prisoner's background which are also included in the histories the prisoner has provided to medical professionals. It is clear from the history provided by the prisoner that the prisoner as a child, in fact as a very young child, suffered a great deal of trauma and neglect and from his very disadvantaged upbringing carried into his adult life a great many problems and disabilities, for want of a better word, which have impacted upon his capacity to live a lawful existence in the community.
	
	
	There is some background of mental illness in his family reported, particularly in the medical reports. The prisoner was in various foster homes and makes claims of physical and sexual abuse. His association with his mother as a child and as a young adult has been very problematic. But he is now in a close relationship with her and said today that he had a close relationship with other members of his family.
	
	
	He is said to have had little or no employment experience as an adult, but has said today, and I am prepared to accept it, he has worked in one area of employment for a period of 18 months. He has undertaken some vocational courses whilst in custody that he detailed today, but his level of literacy skills and other markers of education are limited indeed.
	
	
	So far as the Probation and Parole Service is concerned it says that the prisoner could best be described as, ""institutionalised"", having spent, according to its calculations, only one year and seven months in the community over the past 16 years. The Probation and Parole Service also notes his inability to maintain a lawful lifestyle, as I said earlier, and concludes, ""There is little evidence available to suggest Mr Morrison's compliance with further supervision would be positive.""
	
	
	He is indeed, on their assessment, in need of a medium to high level of intervention by the Service, particularly to address programs to provide him in the future with a gradual reduction in supervision, to assist him in some way to becoming deinstitutionalised so that he can adapt to normal, lawful community life. Notwithstanding what appears to be some success in drug and alcohol counselling in the past, he continues to be a person who needs monitoring in that regard and requires psychological assessment and counselling in relation to his childhood trauma and anger management.
	
	
	The prisoner gave evidence to the Court, and as I said, a number of medical reports were tendered, as well as a psychological report. If I could deal with the prisoner's evidence so far as it reflects upon matters I have touched and the opinions of the psychiatrists and the psychologists. The prisoner said that the history he had given to the professionals was true, although, as I pointed out, he clarified some matters arising in the Probation and Parole Service report.
	
	
	I accept his evidence that during his last term of imprisonment he was not given the opportunity of what could be called staged release, and was not given the opportunity to undertake counselling that clearly is necessary to enable him to cope in the wider community, particularly to address his anger and matters arising out of his unfortunate background.
	
	
	In relation to his custody both presently and in the past, I note that he has for lengthy periods of time has been on protection or subject to ""segregation"". The conditions of his custody were not the subject of evidence by him, nor has any objective or independent evidence been produced to the Court about those matters. I accept that by being in segregation for the reasons that he gave he would have a greater difficulty gaining access, if he can gain access at all, to particular programs. Mention was made in the evidence of the ‘Violent Offenders Program’ which clearly, on the prisoner's criminal history, he needs to undertake to assist him.
	
	
	He acknowledged in his evidence that his segregation status arises from his own behaviour, not because of any particular crimes he has committed or because there is any suggestion of him having cooperated with the authorities in the past. In fact, he said in so many words that his protection status, or segregation status, was both for his protection and/or the protection of others. He has, over a period of time, had a poor disciplinary record in custody and the Probation and Parole Service report notes that even since being back in custody on 2 November he has a number of infractions relating to alleged acts of violence and other matters against his record.
	
	
	He accepts that the anger that he displays in his dealings with other people in custody and sometimes reflected in his frustration in this Court is a current issue for him to address. I accept that counselling to address some of the underlying issues arising from particularly his childhood, need to be addressed in custody, but it should be pointed out that it does not relieve the prisoner, nor has it relieved the prisoner in the past of the responsibility to address these matters himself with or without counselling, particularly by some process of self-examination, at least, to understand what has brought him into custody each time that he has been gaoled.
	
	
	From the prisoner's evidence today and from the material available to the Court I have little evidence that the prisoner up to this point has done that in any meaningful way. There is a saying, ‘the proof is in the pudding’, and in the prisoner's case his criminal history and the facts relating to the matters dealt with by Judge Coorey demonstrate very clearly the propensity of the prisoner for violence when it suits him to get his own way, and his inability to lead a lawful lifestyle when in the wider community.
	
	
	I accept in his favour however that on the last occasion he took advantage of what drug and alcohol counselling he had, and this is reflected in the six to seven weeks of abstinence whilst on parole. I accept that during this period he had no relapse in relation to his use of illicit drugs, and it is not suggested that illicit drugs are a contributing factor to his offending.
	
	
	I note one of the matters he raised today was that the Probation and Parole Service would not allow him to visit his late grandfather who was dying of cancer at that time. In fact, as I understood the evidence before me, one of the reasons that he gives for the commission of the armed robbery was to obtain money to assist him to travel to see his sick grandfather, irrespective of whether the Probation and Parole Service would allow him to go.
	
	
	I can appreciate of course that this was frustrating for him. However, at the same time he had only been out of custody for six or seven weeks. He clearly was a person vulnerable to relapse. The Probation and Parole Service no doubt was very concerned that if he left Wagga where he was apparently in a stable relationship, to return to where his grandfather lived, he might be at risk of reoffending. If he had gone to visit his grandfather as he wished to without the consent of the Probation and Parole Service, this would no doubt have been a potential breach of his parole.
	
	
	In his evidence he believed that in the week before the armed robbery that the combination of the new antidepressant drug, the antipsychotic medication he was taking, and his use of methadone had an adverse effect upon him, particularly the new antidepressant medication, this gave him headaches, raised his levels of anger and frustration.
	
	
	Noting his evidence of what he says and remembers and his reasons for doing what he did, which he really cannot give, these matters offer no explanation as to why he would commit an armed robbery on 2 November 2013 in the manner in which it was committed. Nor is any reason associated with either his mental health or his medication identified either in the opinions of Dr Furst, the evidence of the prisoner, or any other material.
	
	
	I will come back to the relevance of his mental health in sentencing at a later time, but the direct causal connection between his mental health and the offending is not established. As I pointed out to the prisoner, even if his mental health and his use of medication had contributed to him becoming angry and lashing out in a violent way, it does not explain the manner in which the prisoner carried out the armed robbery with which I am concerned, which included of course the foresight of endeavouring to disguise himself and the obtaining of a vehicle in the manner in which he did, to convey himself to the scene of the crime and away from the scene of the crime.
	
	
	In this regard the prisoner gave evidence of memory loss to some extent of relevant events. He has, on his version, a potted memory of some matters. I do not have a transcript of what he said to me today, but my notes suggest that he can remember having a knife, and other matters, but he can't recall, he says, the key relevant events. That claim has to be considered in the context of the detail of the account he gave to police in the electronic interview during which he was shown closed circuit television footage of the crime that he admits he committed. In the course of that electronic interview, and I have only read the transcript, I was not asked to view the video itself, the accused gave a coherent account, distancing himself from the robbery and related events.
	
	
	He says today, frankly, that he did lie to the police but it is quite clear when one looks at the detail of that electronic interview, he lied deliberately and in a considered fashion, providing a great many details that he knew were false. This construction of a denial to the allegation of armed robbery sits at odds with the now claimed lack of memory of relevant events. No such lack of memory was claimed at the time. It is, on a consideration of the totality of the material, even taking into account any consistency between his evidence and the history he gave the psychiatrist, a matter of concern that the prisoner in this way fails to take full responsibility for his actions.
	
	
	Even if it was true that he now has no memory of relevant events, even if it was the result of the mixture of medication that he was taking lawfully at the relevant times, as I said earlier, his actions in the armed robbery reflected as the film made clear, the actions of a man acting with deliberation and with the mental and physical wherewithal to commit the crimes that he wished to commit to achieve the purpose that he had in mind, and that was to obtain money for himself.
	
	
	It may well be that at some point after the event he genuinely has a ""lack of memory"", but clearly, on all the evidence, and the prisoner has not said anything for me to conclude otherwise, when he committed the crime of armed robbery he knew exactly what he was doing, knew exactly what he was doing when he was lying to the police, and clearly, when he asked for directions to Southcity Shopping Centre and took the motor vehicle and asked his friend to wait and disguised himself, knew precisely what his actions were seeking to achieve.
	
	
	He suggested initially to me in his evidence that his late decision to plead guilty arose out of his opportunity to review the closed circuit television footage. This claim did not at the end stand up to any critical examination when I learnt, and it was demonstrated through the ERISP that on 2 November 2011, the police actually took him quite carefully through the footage in respect of which he gave obviously false explanations.
	
	
	There is no suggestion in my reading of the transcript of that interview, and again, without having seen the vision, that the prisoner was in any way affected by medication or incapable of explaining himself to the police. As the prisoner's counsel conceded, his evidence in this very material respect was of no assistance in relation to aspects of the matter, particularly the cogency of explanations he had given in histories as to the circumstances of his offending. Of course, the combination of medication may have been ""counter-indicative"", but even on the basis of the opinions of the doctor, relying of course very much on the history given by the prisoner, it provides no explanation and certainly no excuse for committing the crimes with which I am concerned.
	
	
	I do accept however, from the evidence of the prisoner and from the objective facts of his conduct over the past 16 years, that the prisoner is institutionalised. As I said earlier, this again offers no mitigation for the prisoner, and it certainly provides no real explanation for the prisoner acting towards the victim of the armed robbery in such an unnecessarily violent way. If the prisoner by reason of his institutionalisation felt uncomfortable in the wider community, felt ""more secure"" in custody, in a personal sense, or if he just needed money, as he said he did today, there were far less violent things he could have done to satisfy his needs, whatever they may have been.
	
	
	The facts of the matter are that his criminal history and the assessment of him by the psychologists and the two psychiatrists at different times show the prisoner, by reason of his personality disorder, amongst other things, has a predisposition to commit violent acts, particularly violent crimes, to achieve his ends, as he did on this particular occasion. That brings me to the opinions expressed by Dr Allnutt in 2007, and the report of the psychologist, Mr Jackmon, of 2007. Although they are now over five years old, there are some consistencies with the assessment of Dr Furst. But where any particular inconsistency arises arising out of a particular qualification, where a particular witness has to express an opinion, I prefer the opinions of Dr Furst.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt was of the opinion that the prisoner at that time, in 2007, manifested ongoing symptoms consistent with a resolving psychosis. Quoting the prisoner's history of hospitalisation and treatment as a teenager, and his polysubstance abuse, he concluded that a differential diagnosis would include schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and a drug induced psychosis. He noted the prisoner's disadvantaged background and his lack of education.
	
	
	He concluded that the prisoner's most significant diagnosis at that point was ""substance abuse and substance dependence, particularly to heroin"", and he reflects upon the prisoner's failure to take the relevant medication on his release from custody and attributes substance abuse as the primary cause of his offending.
	
	
	Mr Jackmon's report involved very extensive psychometric testing and in the helpful written submissions of counsel for the accused, he notes the testing revealed that the prisoner ""rated highly"" in a number of areas of ""somatic complaints"", including anxiety, anxiety related disorders, depression, mania, paranoia, schizophrenia borderline features, antisocial features, drug problems, aggression, suicidal ideation and life stress.
	
	
	He also concluded on his testing that the prisoner showed what are described as ""significant traits of post-traumatic stress disorder and substance disorder, and that in 2006 the prisoner revealed quite highly impaired capacity and judgment."" It is worthy of note too that his assessment, also involved in his psychometric testing, produced results that revealed that the prisoner was, ""quite likely to be impulsive and hostile"", and that he had a ""profile consistent with a person who would be expected to have a history of quite antisocial acts.""
	
	
	On the testing that he undertook he said, ""Such individuals may be seen by others as exploitative in their relationships. They tend to have a history of antisocial acts and often manifested a conduct disorder during adolescents."" He went on to say, ""They may be involved in illegal occupations and/or engage in criminal acts involving theft, destruction of property and physical aggression towards others."" He also said, ""They tend to be seen as egocentric with little regard to others or the opinions of the society around them.""
	
	
	He said otherwise that the prisoner's testing revealed he would find it difficult to reduce his drug use and that in the testing in respect of aggression, the score level of the prisoner was such that:
	


""Respondents with that score level were quite likely to be chronically angry and will express freely their anger and hostility. They are easily angered, report having difficulty controlling the expression of their anger, and are likely to be perceived by others as being hostile and readily provoked.""


	
	He said these scores revealed, ""(R)espondents who are not intimidated by confrontation"", et cetera, et cetera. Much of the evidence reflects the accuracy of that assessment. That brings me to the most important report, because of its contemporaneity to the current proceedings, and that is that of Dr Furst. I accept of course the history obtained from the prisoner about previous treatments, particularly as a teenager, that required admission to psychiatric hospitals and the like.
	
	
	He also noted the prisoner's assessment at the Wagga Base Hospital on his release to parole. There appears to be some complaint, if not directly levelled certainly indirectly levelled, at the treating doctor who prescribed the antidepressant medication. However, her note of 2 November 2011 indicated that the prisoner was, ""stable and going well."" If the prisoner was experiencing a reaction to the medication he was taking, from what I understand of the evidence, he made no complaint to the prescribing or treating doctor.
	
	
	Ultimately, the diagnoses of the doctor on the basis of DSM4TR criteria was ""On Axis 1, opiate dependence, on Axis 2, borderline personality disorder, antisocial personality traits."" He said in his report that the prisoner's family, which is no fault of the prisoner of course, was dysfunctional. His mother had a serious mental illness and the prisoner lacked the positive role models in life. He had a number of behavioural and learning difficulties consistent with probably ADHD and conduct disorder, and he had a long history of emotional instability, depression, irritability, impulsivity, anger and chronic deliberate self harm which were consistent with borderline personality disorder.
	
	
	He said that persons with such a disorder often have chronic feelings of emptiness, not caring about life, and make numerous attempts at self harm et cetera, which the prisoner has done. He described a borderline personality disorder as a ""prolonged disturbance of personality function characterised by depth and variability of moods."" The disorder typically involves unusual levels of instability and mood, ""black and white"" thinking … chaotic and unstable interpersonal relationships.""
	
	
	In extreme cases this disturbance in the sense of self can lead to periods of disassociation and these disturbances can have a pervasive and negative impact on many or all of the psychosocial facets of life, including maintaining, obviously, a stable life within the community. These matters are amenable to long term psychotherapy as the condition is also treatable by appropriate medication. He indicated that the prisoner would need to develop plans to engage with mental health services, not only in Justice Health while in custody, but in community health services when released.
	
	
	As to his prospects of rehabilitation, Dr Furst said the prisoner had a pattern of recidivism, with serious violent offences. He had a low level of function, poor coping skills in the community and chronic mood instability as a result of his underlying childhood trauma and personality disorder. His prospects of successful rehabilitation were limited despite the positive efforts he was apparently making when last on parole in 2011. He noted various recommendations within his report which will form part of the papers to assist the prisoner in the future, and steps that should be taken on his release from custody eventually, particularly stable accommodation, psychological counselling and compliance with his medication, should medication be indicated.
	
	
	He noted expressions of remorse by the prisoner to him but he did not volunteer any specific comments about the impact of his actions upon the victim. He said in relation to the prescription of the medication occurring at the time of the offences, he said that with regard to the use of the medication Seroquel, and the antidepressant medication, moclobemide, that ""there is no contraindication to prescribing these medications together.
	
	
	He was apparently reasonably stable in his mood when assessed by Dr Ross on 5 October 2011, and 2 November 2011, ""making the indication for prescribing the antidepressant medication … unclear"". This medication, he said, can cause a paradoxical increase in symptoms of depression and anxiety, especially within the first week or so of treatment. He noted the prisoner's description of, ""a deterioration in his mood in the week or so after he took the medication, making it quite possible he has such adverse effects"", but he went on to say:
	


""There was insufficient evidence to attribute his offending to the prescription of medication, especially as he has a chronic personality disorder that has been characterised by mood swings, depression and anger at various times throughout his life.""


	
	He also stated:
	


""In my opinion his underlying personality disorder and acute depression probably contributed to the impulsivity and poor judgement he displayed at the time of the offence. The medication he was taking at the time may well have contributed to the problems he was having with his mood.""


	
	Whilst I am prepared to accept that opinion, it stands uncontradicted of course on the evidence, it is to be fairly said that one would have some doubts as to whether there was relevantly an ""impulsivity"" in his actions given the course of events, the obtaining of clothing to try and disguise his appearance, the taking of the car and the like. But certainly, whether it be by reason of his personality disorder or other causes, the prisoner had not thought through the consequences of his action. Again, that is difficult to understand in light of the previous sentences imposed upon him, particularly the sentences imposed by Judge Coorey for three quite serious offences of robbery.
	
	
	With regard to the submissions that were made by the parties, they were in written form, very detailed, and I am grateful to both parties for those submissions. Perhaps in one sense it is best to briefly deal with an aspect of the Crown's written submissions because it covers an area that is picked up directly in the thrust of the submissions put on behalf of the prisoner.
	
	
	The Crown properly took the Court to s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and set out a number of authorities and statements of the Court of Criminal Appeal in relation to the various purposes of sentencing. Of course, when the ‘purposes of sentencing’ are considered there are usually, as is the case here, quite a number of them that are relevant, although they may point in opposing directions, particularly the need to promote the rehabilitation of the prisoner as opposed to the need to give weight to personal and general deterrence as well as ensure adequate punishment to the prisoner.
	
	
	The issues that arise from the purposes of sentencing set out in the legislation are very intimately bound up in the submissions that have been made by the defence in the context of the guideline judgment of R v Henry (& Ors) (1999) 46 NSWLR 346, which obviously predates the enactment of s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and the principles that relate to the sentencing of offenders with mental health issues.
	
	
	Insofar as the operation of s 3A and s 21A are concerned, I would understand Henry to reflect in anticipation, perhaps unknowingly, a number of the matters that now are required to be taken into account under the legislation. The judgment in Henry as a guideline judgment is, to be fairly said, not inconsistent in general terms with relevant considerations that arise now under the legislation.
	
	
	Of course, I am very mindful of the fact that a guideline is not a “tramline”. It is merely an indication of an appropriate penalty, but to get some measure to the matter with which I am concerned it was pointed out in the written submissions of the defence, when one has regard to the ""common category"", a case to which the guideline applies, reflecting a sentence in the range of four to five years in the context of the wide discretion a sentencing judge has for such a ""typical case"", the various features of such a ""supposedly typical"" case are not to be found here.
	
	
	As was pointed out the prisoner was not a young offender with little or no criminal history. There was actual violence used, albeit that the victim was not physically injured. The prisoner used the weapon effectively to achieve his ends, and for admittedly, a brief period of time, a matter, as I said, of 15 seconds perhaps, maybe no more, there was a very real and intense threat of use of force reflected in the anxious actions of the other member of staff to prevent what she thought was the impending injury to her frightened colleague.
	
	
	The prisoner, it is said, reflected in the commission of the offence a limited amount of planning, but the offence was not impulsive. In fact, it was premeditated in a range of ways. The prisoner chose a motor vehicle that he took without the owner's consent, in a very professional manner, to be taken to a place that he was shown by a friend, where he believed, as I understand it, a robbery could be committed. He took a cap and wore clothing to endeavour to disguise his appearance, and I assume that included endeavouring to cover tattoos on his person, because certainly the identification of a tattoo was one matter the police were reliant upon. He chose a place where he believed he could obtain the money that he needed.
	
	
	There is no direct evidence of whether ‘The Reject Shop’ was the first place he chose or he had an opportunity to look at other places within the shopping centre. Certainly his presence in the shopping centre was only a matter of minutes. As I said, there was then a concerted, deliberate and purposeful set of actions undertaken by him to obtain the money that he needed, with threats, and he had a motor vehicle waiting nearby to enable him to get away from the scene of the crime.
	
	
	It was not sophisticated planning of course, and it was planning over a relatively short period of time, but it certainly wasn't limited planning to the point of an impulsive crime committed at a particular place by what could be called a happenchance. Ultimately, noting the very fair concessions in the written submissions of the defence, it was conceded that this was, ""a serious example of the offence of robbery (of its type) whilst armed."" With that submission one could not argue.
	
	
	With regard to the matters that are arising out of s 21A, whether it be from s 21A(1) or (2), as they directly deal with aggravating features, I accept that the use of a weapon and the use of violence are matters that might reasonably be reflected in consideration of the matter from the perspective of the Henry guideline. As to the previous criminal history of the prisoner, I accept ultimately that I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that his prior record had the effect of aggravating the offence with which I am concerned but it deprives the prisoner of leniency, and also indicates in this matter that subject to consideration of his mental health, more weight is to be given to retribution, personal deterrence and the protection of society.
	
	
	As is cited in the written submissions, the High Court in Veen (No 2) v R (1998) 164 CLR 465, in particular, said at 477-478:
	


""The antecedent criminal history is relevant … to show whether the instant offence is an uncharacteristic aberration or whether the offender has manifested in his commission of the instant offence a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. In the latter case retribution, deterrence and the protection of society may all indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted.

It is legitimate to take into account the antecedent criminal history when it illuminates the moral culpability of the offender in the instant case, or shows his dangerous propensity, or shows a need to impose condign punishment to deter the offender and others from committing further offences of a like kind.""


	
	The armed robbery offence was not an uncharacteristic aberration. It shows in its commission a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. His criminal history illuminates his moral culpability and shows to some extent his dangerous propensity, particularly when one compares the similarity of his conduct on this occasion with the matters with which Judge Coorey was concerned.
	
	
	I appreciate however that there can be no doubt that the offence being committed on parole and within seven or eight weeks of release to parole is a significant aggravating factor and is to be found as an aggravating factor both under the common law principles of sentencing that existed before the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, and under s 21A(2). I also appreciate of course that the matters that I have referred to relating to his criminal history very much overlap with that particular consideration of the aggravation of committing this offence whilst on parole.
	
	
	It is conceded in the written submissions as an aggravating factor that the victim was a vulnerable person by reason of her occupation. But there were other people nearby, she was not completely alone. In fact, the intervention of her colleague whose courage should be commended, to ""save the day"", because the young girl could not open up the cash register, was very decisive. I have dealt with the issue of planning, the planning was not sophisticated, but there was a degree of planning beyond that which was materially inherent to such an offence.
	
	
	Because the offence charges the theft of money, it is an element of the offence that does not require a finding of aggravation that the offence was committed for financial gain. It is self evident that in an armed robbery offence that that would be the purpose, that is why the legislature reflects the maximum penalty such as it is given the elements of the offence. I am very mindful of the fact of course that any mitigating or aggravating factor present does not necessarily require an adjustment of the sentence accordingly, in accordance with s 21A(5) of the Act.
	
	
	I am prepared to accept ultimately, in the context of no victim impact statement and no physical injury to the victim, although she must have been terrified and affected by this, that ultimately there is no evidence of injury or loss or damage of a substantial character. I also accept the plea of guilty as a mitigating factor pursuant to s 21A(3). In relation to remaining matters I note the prisoner's expressions of remorse to the psychiatrist, and in his evidence to this Court, but ultimately, in the manner in which it has come forward and its timing, and in the context of the evidence the prisoner has given relating to his recollection of the relevant events, I am not satisfied on balance that the remorse shown by the prisoner is a relevant mitigating factor.
	
	
	I certainly could not conclude on the evidence that the prisoner was not fully aware of the consequences of his actions. Obviously, and I think this is conceded in the written submissions, I cannot conclude the prisoner is unlikely to reoffend or that he has good prospects of rehabilitation; the evidence he himself produces is to that effect. These findings accord generally with the position of the Crown reflected in its written submissions.
	
	
	The Crown's submissions in relation to the mitigating and aggravating factors have been taken into account. As I earlier indicated the conclusions I reach generally accord with the position of both parties save for matters of minor importance. The prisoner, as I said earlier, is entitled to a 10% discount for the utilitarian benefit of his plea of guilty. One issue raised at the forefront of the submissions made today by the defence was the issue of a finding of special circumstances which is sought by the prisoner pursuant to s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	The Crown has drawn the Court's attention to the decision, and it is well known to it, of R v Simpson, when a five judge bench considered the meaning of ""special circumstances"", pursuant to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in the context of an existing law. The words ""special circumstances"" have existed in legislation since at last the passing of s 9 Sentencing Act in 1989.
	
	
	Ultimately the Crown ""concedes there are special circumstances present insofar as this offender is concerned."" This is, I take it from the oral submissions, addressing matters beyond the issue of partial accumulation which itself is a special circumstance. It is submitted by the Crown however that a non-parole period should be reflective of the seriousness of the offence and the offender's antecedents.
	
	
	I have taken into account that concession by the Crown, and also the various matters raised in the written submissions of the prisoner. I have concluded that there are, notwithstanding the prisoner's failings on parole in 2011, and in the past, matters that are relevant to the assessment of special circumstances and justify the exercise of the discretion to adjust the non-parole period in the prisoner's favour.
	
	
	There is the issue of the partial accumulation of the sentences I will impose upon the revoked parole, or balance of sentence. There is clearly, given the prisoner's institutionalisation, the need for professional assistance to adjust to community living. I do not recall any particular reference to this in the written submissions, but without citing the authority in detail, I clearly remember the judgment of Wood J in R v Moffitt (1990) 20 NSWLR 114, particularly at pp 120 to 121.
	
	
	His Honour, in one of three judgments given in that case, including the judgment of Badgery-Parker J, reflected upon the fact that special circumstances may arise in the fixing of a non-parole period for a person who is institutionalised and/or is facing a lengthy period of imprisonment having spent many years in custody without having had a chance to adjust to community living.
	
	
	The matter here is not as simple at that in any event. Militating more in favour of a finding of special circumstances and some adjustment of the non-parole period, the prisoner has an underlying mental health history and requires counselling both in custody and out of custody to address that mental health history, whatever the ultimate diagnosis will be. He also will have continuing issues to address in relation to his previous drug and alcohol dependency. For those reasons I have concluded that the prisoner should have the benefit of the finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	I have been very troubled I must say by the detail of the facts that were presented to Judge Coorey and their relationship to the current matter. I note the consistency of conduct, the expedient conduct to obtain a short term advantage, the use of unnecessary violence to achieve the ends sought by the prisoner, a failure of the prisoner over a lengthy period of time to acknowledge what could fairly be said, for example, in relation to the matters Judge Coorey dealt with, his clearly established guilt and a lengthy period of time before any adoption of responsibility, in each case that adoption of responsibility coming too late to be of significance in the sentencing proceedings.
	
	
	There is always, in the case of the prisoner, a concern about his future, not just for his sake, because the Court is concerned about his future, but for the reason that failings by him in the future will have an impact upon others, as has been proven in the past. As was said in Yardley v Betts, adopted by Wood J in the decision of Blackman and Walters v R, to paraphrase King CJs words, rehabilitation of offenders is not just in the interests of the offender, it is in the community interest. If a person be deterred or directed away from a criminal activity, that works not just for the benefit of the prisoner, but for the benefit of potential victims of his crimes and the community at large.
	
	
	Returning to the written submissions of the defence in that other major respect that I earlier indicated, in sentencing the prisoner I accept that the prisoner has ""other mental problems"" that are of at least direct relevance to his offending. There is no direct link established either in the medical evidence or in the evidence given by the prisoner today, but I accept that the prisoner's conduct in committing this crime in an indirect way was compelled by a condition which is a product of events and circumstances beyond the prisoner's control.
	
	
	While it may be said in these circumstances that the need to denounce the prisoner's conduct to give weight to general deterrence may be reduced to some extent, it may also be said in the context of the prisoner's conditions and his past performance, that the prisoner, with his condition, potentially presents as a danger to the community and a greater weight is needed in relation to specific deterrents. If one was undertaking some form of weighing exercise in relation to the competing considerations that arise, for example, on the principles summarised in the decision of De La Rosa (2010) 205 A Crim R 1, particularly at [177] - [178], what benefit might be given to the prisoner in reduction, reducing to some extent the need for a denunciation and general deterrence is balanced out by the clear need for an element of specific deterrence.
	
	
	In that regard I note the submissions of the Crown in relation to this matter. The Crown submitted, and I generally accept, that the mental condition of the prisoner had little direct causal connection with the commission of the offence, although the Crown accepts that the prisoner has suffered from a long term ""mental illness."" On the other hand, as the Crown points out, it has been held that matters of general deterrence, denunciation and the like are not completely irrelevant where a causal connection is found. The significance of the mental condition or incapacity of the prisoner is to be weighed and evaluated in the light of the particular facts and circumstances of the individual case.
	
	
	If the prisoner in a particular case acts with knowledge of what he is doing, and with knowledge of the gravity of his actions, the moderation need not be great, (paraphrasing R v Wright NSWCCA (1997) - unreported) and of course the prisoner's evidence ultimately confirmed that whatever the gaps in his memory, he must have had a full appreciation of what he was doing, as his actions make clear.
	
	
	Having tried to digest in a careful way all the matters that have been raised through the evidence of the submissions, I have come to the following conclusions. Just stand up please, Mr Morrison.
	
	
	In relation to the offence to which you have pleaded guilty I have determined that the starting point of the sentence to be imposed upon you should be seven years and six months. I have given you a 10% discount and thus the total sentence for the offence of armed robbery will be six years and nine months commencing on 2 October 2013.
	
	
	The sentence will expire on 1 July 2020, however, having regard to the fact that I have concluded that there are special circumstances I have concluded in your case that the non-parole period on that sentence, admittedly commencing 2 October 2013, shall be three years and nine months.
	
	
	That non-parole period will expire, on my calculation, on 1 July 2017, commencing on 1 October 2013.
	
	
	The balance of sentence is three years, is that correct? Just take a seat, Mr Morrison, you do not need to stand up for my mental arithmetic.
	
	
	OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: The balance of sentence of three years, this sentence reflects not only a finding of special circumstances, but in the context of the sentence I am imposing upon you, a conclusion that that period of time is a sufficient period of time for such benefit as you may receive from parole in the future to be achieved without diminishing the non-parole period, or the effective non‑parole period below that which would be appropriate having regard to the crimes you have committed.
	
	
	In relation to the offence of take and drive a motor vehicle without the consent of the owner, I have determined that the appropriate penalty for that matter should be a term of imprisonment of 12 months. That sentence will commence on 2 October 2013 and expire on 1 October 2014.
	
	
	For the offence of driving in a manner dangerous to the public, as with the take and drive matter, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of six months to commence on 2 October 2013, and to expire on 1 April 2014. In respect of that offence you are disqualified from driving or holding a motor vehicle driver's licence for a period of two years from today, being 13 February 2013.
	
	
	In respect of the offence of never having been licensed, you are convicted and you are fined the sum of $500, and I grant you 28 days to pay that fine. You will be eligible for release to parole on 1 July 2017, but of course the Parole Authority will have to make that decision, not I.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Are there any other matters Mr King, Madam Crown?
	
	
	KING: No, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Yes, thank you, Mr Morrison, you can go with the officers, thank you. Thank you, Madam Crown for your assistance, thank you, Mr King.

		30 March 2015",2013-02-12 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2707169,Hay v R [2013] NSWCCA 22,"Judgment

1SIMPSON J: On 9 February 2011 the appellant was arraigned in the District Court on an indictment containing two counts, each brought under the Criminal Code (Cth) (""the Code""). The first count was of conspiracy to import a marketable quantity of a border controlled drug (cocaine), alleged to have been committed between 30 October 2008 and 20 September 2009 (the Code, s 307.2(1) and s 11.5(1)). On this count, the appellant was jointly charged with another man, Wayne Charles Williams. The second count against the appellant (but not against Williams) was of possession of a marketable quantity of an unlawfully imported border controlled drug (cocaine) (the Code, s 307.6(1)), alleged to have been committed on 20 September 2009. 

2The appellant entered a plea of not guilty to each count. Williams entered a plea of not guilty to the single count against him.

3On 25 March 2011 the jury returned verdicts of guilty of each charge against the appellant. At that time it had not reached a verdict in respect of the count against Williams. Ultimately, in circumstances it is unnecessary to recount, the jury was discharged without verdict in respect of the count against Williams.

4Each of the offences of which the appellant was convicted carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years and/or a fine not exceeding $550,000. On 23 September 2011 the appellant was sentenced, on each count, to imprisonment for 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years, the sentences to be served concurrently, commencing on 27 December 2009.

5The appellant appeals against the convictions and seeks leave to appeal against the sentences.

The Crown case

6What follows is an account of the case the Crown presented at trial. It does not represent findings of fact other than those necessarily encompassed in the jury verdicts. 

7The appellant was a member of a syndicate that included among its members Wayne Dennis John Cleveland, Craig Tira Nicholson, Jose Arnel Alquillera, Williams, and various others. The syndicate had previously, in 2007, imported a commercial quantity of cocaine into Australia, by the same method the Crown allege was used in the 2008-2009 conspiracy. The appellant was not involved in the 2007 importation.

8From August 2008 the appellant was employed as a driver by Gate Gourmet, a catering company that serviced airlines flying international routes to and from the Sydney International Airport. One of the airlines so serviced was United Airlines. The appellant's work was based at a catering centre in Mascot, approximately 2 kilometres from the airport. His duties required him to attend at the catering centre, load items onto trucks, drive to the airport, transport the catering items, and load the catering items into the galleys of the aircraft. Alquillera had a similar position. Both men worked shift work, according to prepared rosters. 

9On 14 September 2012 Craig Nicholson flew from Sydney to Los Angeles, with the intention of returning on flight UA839, to arrive in Sydney on 20 September. The appellant manipulated his shift work arrangements to ensure that he would be working on flight UA839 on that day, with Alquillera who was already rostered for that flight. Nicholson boarded the flight as planned; he was in possession of two packages of cocaine. These he secreted in a rubbish receptacle in a toilet cubicle at the rear of the aircraft cabin. In accordance with the arrangements, Alquillera boarded the aircraft. While servicing the galley, he removed the cocaine, placed it in a catering container in a service trolley which was then loaded onto a Gate Gourmet truck positioned at the rear of the aircraft. 

10Alquillera and the appellant were apprehended shortly after, in possession of the two blocks of cocaine (which proved to have a pure weight of 250.7 grams) on the trolley.

The trial

11In the trial there was extensive evidence of communications by telephone or text message, a relatively small number of which involved the appellant, which had been intercepted and recorded. These communications contained material consistent with arrangements for the importation of the cocaine.

12The appellant gave evidence in the trial. He gave explanations for a number of the communications. It is unnecessary to go into all of the detail.

13The appellant's evidence was to the effect that the purpose of re-arranging the roster for the UA839 flight on 20 September was to enable Alquillera to ""pilfer"" items from the duty free carts on the aircraft, and that he himself then became involved in the ""pilfering"" which was, in effect, an established practice. Given the arguments advanced on the appeal, it is important to recognise here that the appellant's evidence was to the effect that it was Alquillera who was the principal ""pilferer"", and that he (the appellant) himself became drawn into the pilfering, in a minor way, receiving what Alquillera allowed him to have. The pilfering, on the appellant's account, was rather small scale; apart from some items such as after shave lotion that the men retained for themselves, small items were passed to a market stall holder for quite modest amounts of money. 

14Plainly, by its verdicts, the jury rejected this alternative hypothesis put forward by the appellant as an explanation for otherwise apparently incriminating communications and conduct. 

15That rejection had a sound basis in the evidence. A Ms Leanne Benson, a United Airlines employee, gave evidence in the Crown case. Among other things, Ms Benson described a security system concerning the duty free trolleys that she had introduced in 2006, as a result of the loss (theft) of items from the trolleys. Although some losses had continued until 2007, there were no records of loss or theft thereafter. 



The conviction appeal

The grounds of appeal

16Initially, two grounds of appeal against the convictions were pleaded. They were in the following terms:

""1. There has been a miscarriage of justice in the trial of the applicant (sic) on account of fresh evidence and evidence undisclosed at the trial.

2. There has been a miscarriage of justice in the trial of the applicant on account of the jury making their own enquiries regarding the case prior to and after the finding of the appellant as guilty of the charges at the trial.""

At the commencement of the hearing of the appeal, counsel for the appellant abandoned ground 2.

17Three grounds of appeal against sentence were pleaded. I will come to these in due course.

18The principles upon which fresh evidence will be admitted on appeal were comprehensively stated by Kirby J in R v Abou-Chabake [2004] NSWCCA 356; 49 A Crim R 417. His Honour adverted to a distinction between ""fresh evidence"" (evidence not available to the accused, actually or constructively, at the time of the trial) and ""new evidence"". Evidence is constructively available if it could have been discovered, or available at the trial, by the exercise of due diligence.

19The other matters set out by his Honour are:


great latitude is extended to an accused in determining what evidence, by reasonable diligence, could have been available at his trial: Ratten v The Queen [1974] HCA 35; (1974) 131 CLR 510;


the ultimate question is whether there has been a miscarriage of justice;


the evidence must therefore be examined in the context of the evidence given in the trial: Mickelberg v The Queen [1989] HCA 35; 167 CLR 259;


a significant issue is the capacity of the new or fresh evidence to sustain the orders sought in the appeal;


where it is contended that the evidence would justify a new trial, a number of questions must be answered affirmatively:

(i)is the evidence fresh? (in the sense outlined above);

(ii)is the evidence credible? (Gallagher v The Queen [1986] HCA 26; (1986) 160 CLR 392; Mickelberg);

(iii)if the evidence is credible, would it, in the context of the evidence given at the trial, have been likely to have caused the jury to have entertained a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused? (Gallagher, Mickelberg).

20The evidence upon which the appellant now seeks to rely is evidence contained in a report, prepared for sentencing purposes, by a psychologist, Mr Tim Watson-Munro. I will extract some significant passages from that report:

""Despite the finding of the Court Mr Hay maintains his innocence. He offers as an explanation for his association with this matter the fact that he was involved in stealing duty free goods from Sydney airport during the course of his employment there. Attendant to this he further describes a tendency towards compulsive and impulsive stealing (Kleptomania) and that as a sideline though illegal business, he is making additional income from selling the wares which he pilfered. 

... [Mr Watson-Munro went on to outline a history he took from the appellant, including a history of sexual abuse by an uncle when the appellant was 5 years of age. In this context, Mr Watson-Munro said that it was clear that the appellant had suffered from longstanding emotional problems.]

To close the history taking Mr Hay described a longstanding pattern of stealing over the years, which he conceded at times was somewhat beyond his control with a certain compulsive element to his behaviour. He stated that this was of relevance to his employment at Sydney Airport where he became involved in pilfering duty free goods and selling them in order to supplement his income.

...

Testing confirms a high level of unresolved psychological malaise. 

Opinion:

1. Mr Hay presents as a cooperative though highly anxious and depressed man ... In addition he has elements of post-traumatic stress disorder in the context of he and his now deceased brother being sexually abused by his mother's sister's husband commencing when he was 5 years old and continuing for a number of years. This no doubt established the platform for his continuing psychological malaise to the present.

2. ...

[Discovery of the sexual abuse] in turn led to a recrudescence of his symptoms inclusive of flashbacks, nightmares, hyper vigilance to danger, the loss of trust in others, social withdrawal and very low self esteem ... When pressed Mr Hay stated that he has suffered from poor impulse control over the years which has manifested itself in a pattern of stealing which came to the fore when he was placed in a position where this was possible through his employment at Sydney Airport and attendant to this the distribution of duty free goods.

3. In more recent times he has been affected by the break down of his marriage ...

4. ...

5. ..."" (italics added)

21The reliance sought to be placed on this material on behalf of the appellant lay in the support which it was asserted it gave to the defence he advanced, that his activity was to do with ""pilfering"" and not with drug importation. It is for that reason that I have above referred to the evidence given by the appellant at trial. As I have pointed out, he did not explicitly speak of stealing by himself, but of being drawn into the established stealing pattern of Alquillera. That is a long way from the ""compulsive stealing"" which he described to Mr Watson-Munro.

22There are a number of other reasons, however, why the ground of appeal must fail. First, it is quite plain that the evidence does not qualify as ""fresh evidence"", in the sense in which that term is properly used. The source of Mr Watson-Munro's report was the appellant himself. Plainly that information was available to him at the time of the trial.

23An attempt was made to establish that it was the link between the sexual abuse of the appellant as a child and his ""compulsive stealing"" that was not available to the appellant at trial. The difficulty with that proposition is that Mr Watson-Munro does not himself make that link, or give any diagnosis of a condition known as ""kleptomania"". The opening passage of the extract above is no more than Mr Watson-Munro recounting the history given to him by the appellant. True it is that Mr Watson-Munro has inserted the label ""kleptomania"" but he does not give any diagnosis of such a condition. Nor does that appear anywhere in the rather lengthy opinion section of the report. When this was put to counsel for the appellant, she argued that Mr Watson-Munro, given an opportunity, might make that link. That was insufficient to enable this Court to take into account evidence of such a connection. That Mr Watson-Munro might, given an opportunity, make that link was pure speculation. In any event, it is immaterial. The reason the appellant sought to rely on Mr Watson-Munro's report was to establish that he was a compulsive thief, as support for his claim that, rather than being involved in the importation of drugs, he was involved in petty theft. A causal connection with sexual abuse would not strengthen that proposition. 

24Even if the content of Mr Watson-Munro's report had been placed before the jury, it would be quite insufficient to establish the sort of connection for which counsel now contends.

25Another circumstance lies in the nature of the evidence given by the appellant in the trial. As I have pointed out above, he did not give any evidence of a history of stealing on his own behalf, compulsive or otherwise. His evidence was largely self-serving, distancing himself from the pattern of stealing that he asserted. That is a very long way from the position he now seeks to take. 

26The evidence can not in any way come within the parameters outlined by Kirby J for the admission of fresh evidence.

27I would reject this ground, and dismiss the appeal against conviction.

Sentence 

28The grounds of proposed appeal against sentence are pleaded as follows:

""3. The learned judge erred in that he took no account of evidence given at sentence by the appellant regarding harshness of gaol conditions concerning the appellant's medical condition.

4. The appellant has a justifiable sense of grievance regarding the issue of parity with the co-offender, Borg. 

5. The sentence is too severe taking into account the effect upon the appellant's family.""

Ground 3: the appellant's medical condition

29The appellant gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings. 

30By way of background, at some stage during the course of the trial, the appellant was briefly admitted to hospital suffering from what was said to be a gall bladder condition.

31In the sentencing proceedings he gave evidence that he discharged himself from the hospital against medical advice and returned for the continuation of the trial. He said that he had not received any treatment or surgery since being taken into custody after his conviction, notwithstanding ""numerous"" requests for treatment. He said that he was still in need of gall bladder surgery.

32That was the extent of the evidence which comes within the parameters of ground 3 as formulated.

33In the sentencing remarks, the judge erroneously said that the appellant had not given evidence during the sentence proceedings. He said this in the context of considering Mr Watson-Munro's report. He said:

""I am not able to conclude, as I have already indicated, that alcohol or matters identified by the psychologist as touching upon the level of cognitive functioning of the offender bear any causative connection to his offending here.""

34The submissions made on the appellant's behalf in the sentencing proceedings in this respect were as follows:

""He is also still suffering his condition with the gall bladder, he's had no treatment. He sought, as he said, a number of times for treatment in gaol and hasn't received any. It is also, your Honour, the first time he would be incarcerated for such a period of time and I think he said he's already done 21 months.""

35Accordingly, although it was a clear error for his Honour to say that the appellant had not given evidence in the sentencing proceedings, ground 3 is based upon a false premise - that there was evidence, overlooked by his Honour, concerning ""harshness of gaol conditions"" as a result of the appellant's physical health. There was no such evidence.

36Similarly, to the extent that the submissions in support of this ground relied upon a hypothesis that the appellant suffered from a psychological condition diagnosed as ""kleptomania"", they are misconceived. As indicated above, in respect of the conviction appeal, there was no such diagnosis.

37This ground should be rejected.

Ground 4: parity - ""the co-offender Borg""

38In the introductory passages of these reasons, I have identified certain named co-conspirators. It will be observed that the indictment also alleged that various others (""divers others"") were involved. The name ""Borg"" does not appear in the list of those named as parties to the conspiracy.

39Geoffrey Wayne Borg was sentenced by the same judge on 29 July 2011. He had pleaded guilty to a charge of importing a commercial quantity of cocaine between 30 November and 2 December 2007. This was the earlier importation by the same syndicate to which I have referred above. As I have also mentioned above, the appellant was not involved in that importation.

40It is therefore incorrect to call Borg a ""co-offender"". 

41Borg was sentenced to imprisonment for 7 years and 6 months, with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months. The sentence that otherwise would have been imposed was reduced by 25 percent in recognition of his plea of guilty.

42The question of parity of sentencing has been considered by the High Court and by this Court on many occasions: see, for example, Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295; Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462; Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60; 77 NSWLR 540. It is unnecessary here to restate the principles there stated. It is sufficient to note that Borg was charged with a different offence, he pleaded guilty, he was sentenced on the basis of his role in the conspiracy in which he was involved. His sentence, particularly when the 25 percent reduction is factored in, was significantly higher than the sentence imposed upon the appellant.

43Ground 4 should be rejected.

Ground 5: effect on the appellant's family

44Again, the only colour of legitimacy in relation to this ground is the erroneous statement by the sentencing judge that the appellant did not give evidence in the sentencing proceedings. 

45However, it is again necessary to examine the evidence which it is contended was overlooked.

46In fact, the appellant himself gave no evidence of the effect of his imprisonment upon his family. He had been on bail for a time prior to and during the trial. He gave evidence that he had two children from a de facto relationship, and that he had subsequently married another woman. A 14 year old son from the de facto relationship lived with him and his wife. 

47There was some material in Mr Watson-Munro's report concerning the appellant's family. His marriage had disintegrated as a result of his incarceration. According to Mr Watson-Munro, his son had developed ""a range of symptoms reflective of a conduct disorder"" which had led to his being placed in juvenile detention.

48That was the extent of the evidence relevant to this ground of appeal.

49It is well established that the effect on family or others can be taken into account only in exceptional circumstances: R v Edwards (1996) A Crim R 510. The evidence in this case does not remotely approach the necessary standard. Accordingly, although it was an error for his Honour to have said that the appellant did not give evidence, there was no evidence that would have enabled him to make any adjustment to the sentence by reason of the effect on the appellant's family.

50This ground of appeal should be rejected.

51It follows that an appeal against sentence, if leave is granted, should be dismissed.

52I propose the following orders:

(i) Appeal against conviction dismissed;

(ii) Leave granted to appeal against sentence;

(iii) Appeal against sentence dismissed.

53FULLERTON J: I agree with Simpson J.

54DAVIES J: I agree with Simpson J.

		13 February 2013",2013-02-12 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2707175,Parris v R [2013] NSWCCA 5,"Judgment

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Adamson J. 

2LATHAM J: I agree with Adamson J. 

3ADAMSON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on him following his plea of guilty to an offence of supplying a commercial quantity of cocaine. There are three grounds of appeal:

(1)The Sentencing Judge gave undue weight to the quantity of drugs involved in the offence;

(2)The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive; and

(3)The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance in light of the sentence imposed on a participant, Richard Lipton: R v Lipton [2012] NSWDC 201.

4The applicant pleaded guilty to supplying a commercial quantity of prohibited drug (cocaine) contrary to s 25(2) of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (DMTA). The maximum penalty for this offence is, relevantly, twenty years' imprisonment: s 33(2) of DMTA. There is a standard non-parole period of 10 years.

5The applicant asked the Sentencing Judge to take into account six Form 1 offences, each of which was admitted to have occurred on 22 May 2009. Five of the offences were offences against s 16(1) of the Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act 1966 (PTGA) for possession of the following prescribed restricted substances:

(1)7 boxes of testosterone;

(2)8 tablets of mesterolone;

(3)60.5 g of oxandrolone;

(4)methenolone;

(5)27.9 g of stanzol.

6Offences under s 16(1) of the PTGA carry a maximum period of imprisonment of 2 years.

7The sixth Form 1 offence was an offence against s 527C(1)(c) of the Crimes Act 1900 (persons unlawfully in possession of property). The relevant property was $14,000 in cash.

8The Sentencing Judge allowed a discount of 12.5% for the plea of guilty. His Honour found special circumstances and reduced the non-parole period to approximately 40% of the total term.

9The total sentence, taking into account the Form 1 matters, was 6 years 1 month and 15 days with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months to commence on 25 May 2009, the date of his arrest, and expire on 24 November 2011 with a balance of parole of 3 years and 7 months and 15 days to commence on 25 November 2011 and expire on 9 July 2015. 

10At the time of the hearing of his application before this Court, the applicant had been released to parole.

The facts

11On 22 May 2009, after the Strike Force formed to investigate the supply of cocaine in the Eastern Suburbs by Mr Lipton had received certain information, police executed a search warrant at the unit where the applicant lived on South Dowling Street. The applicant was at his parents' home in Maroubra when the warrant was executed. It was common ground that the flat-mate, with whom the applicant shared the unit, was not involved in the offences.

12Police found 707.2 g of cocaine with a purity of 78.5% in a clear plastic vacuum-sealed bag in a kitchen cupboard. They found a further 7 g of cocaine and other prescribed restricted substances (which are the subject of the Form 1 offences) in the applicant's bedroom.

13The applicant was arrested on 26 May 2009. He declined to be interviewed. 

14The applicant gave evidence at the sentence hearing. He relied upon a handwritten statement, in which he said that Mr Lipton gave him the bag containing the cocaine together with $14,000 in cash four days before the warrant was executed. He said that he was storing the drugs for Mr Lipton and was not involved in the supply. Mr Lipton provided him with cocaine for his own use. He was not otherwise remunerated.

15He also relied on a report of forensic psychologist, Dr Watson-Munro, who opined that his mother's diagnosis of cancer had affected his judgment at the time of the offending. The applicant's sister and father both gave evidence as to the applicant's remorse, his mother's illness, the applicant's drug use and his apparent cessation of drug use since being in custody.

The first ground: the weight of the drug

16Under Schedule 1 of the DMTA, the commercial quantity of cocaine is 250 g and the large commercial quantity is 1 kg. The quantity of the drug of 714g was, accordingly significant. The quantity of the drug is a ""very material consideration"" in assessing the overall seriousness of the offence: Paxton v R [2011] NSWCCA 242 at [132], per Johnson J (Tobias AJA and Hall J agreeing). It is not, however, the sole, or chief factor to be taken into account in determining the objective seriousness of the offence: Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584. Rather it is a factor that will be relevant to such a determination but the relevance of which will depend on the circumstances of each case.

17There is no indication in the ROS that the Sentencing Judge gave undue weight to the amount and purity of the cocaine. Indeed at the sentence hearing the applicant's counsel conceded, in my view properly, that the submission that the offence was at the low end of the range of seriousness was foreclosed to him because of the quantity, purity, and concomitant value, of the drug.

18Since the first ground appears to be a conclusion that the Sentencing Judge must have given undue weight to the quantity of cocaine because of the length of the sentence and the role played by the applicant, the question is, in substance, to be determined by resolution of the second ground: namely that the sentenced imposed was manifestly excessive.

The second and third grounds: that the sentence was manifestly excessive and that there was an unjustified disparity between applicant's sentence and that imposed on Lipton

19In the course of the hearing of the application for leave, the applicant's submission that the sentence was manifestly excessive was, in substance, confined to a submission that there was an unjustified disparity between his sentence and Lipton's. Accordingly I will consider the two grounds together, since I did not understand the second ground to be independently pursued.

20The applicant argued that he was entitled to feel a justified sense of grievance because the difference between their respective offences and moral culpability ought to have been reflected in a greater difference in their sentences and that this Court ought intervene to rectify the inconsistency or disparity.

Sentence imposed on Lipton

21Between the date of filing of the application for leave to appeal, which contained the second ground, and the hearing of the application, Lipton pleaded guilty to two offences and was sentenced by the Sentencing Judge as follows:





Date of offence

Offence

Max penalty

SNPP

Sentence, taking into account 25% discount for plea and special circumstances

Undiscounted sentence


22 April 2009

Supply a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, 586.9 g ecstasy: DMTA s 25(2)

Life

15 years

6 years commencing 21 May 2009 and expiring on 20 May 2015, with a non-parole period of 3 years expiring on 20 May 2012

8 years


21 May 2009

Supply a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, 1.905 kg of cocaine: DMTA s 25(2)

Life

15 years

7 years and 6 months, commencing 21 November 2009, and expiring on 20 May 2017

10 years

22Lipton was thus sentenced to an overall term of imprisonment of 8 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months. His undiscounted sentence for supplying a large commercial quantity of cocaine was 10 years; the applicant's undiscounted sentence for possession of a large commercial quantity of cocaine was 7 years.

23The Sentencing Judge accepted that Lipton was not an addict and was engaged in drug supply for the purposes of profit.

24Lipton gave evidence at his own sentence hearing. The Sentencing Judge said of Lipton, at [54]-[56]:

""He sought to claim that his mind was in turmoil and he supplied drugs to the undercover police officer because of the turbulent nature of his relationship with MB [his erstwhile girlfriend] but he agreed that he was not pressured by the undercover police officer to supply the drugs. He agreed to supply the drugs of his own accord.

There is no doubt, however, in my mind that he would not have embarked on the providing of thirty ounces of cocaine except for the fact that the officer sought that amount of cocaine. During the conversations with the officer, it seemed to be made clear to me that this was much more than he had ever supplied before. In a very real sense, he involved himself in the large commercial supply of cocaine because the officer asked him to supply it and a similar conclusion can be reached with regard to the supply of MDMA [methylenedioxymethamphetamine].

The Crown did not seek to contradict the offender by calling evidence from the undercover police officer or from MB. It could have done so and I can only conclude that calling either of these witnesses would not have advanced case the Crown was seeking to make.""

25The Sentencing Judge, who had the advantage of seeing and hearing Lipton give evidence at the sentence hearing, said, at [60]:

""Ultimately I have come to the conclusion that I should regard his drug dealing as serious but not as serious as it would have been if no explanation had been given about his involvement. In my opinion these offences should not be regarded as meriting very severe punishments.""

26It is apparent from the ROS that the Sentencing Judge accepted Lipton's evidence that he had been, in substance, lured into a different league of drug-dealing than that with which he had previously been involved, by an undercover police officer and that this was an effective cause of his commission of the offences to which he had pleaded guilty.

27In R v Taouk (1992) 65 A Crim R 387 at 403, Badgery-Parker J, with whom Clarke JA and Abadee J agreed, said:

""...the real thrust of the decisions is that even where the conduct of the police was regarded by the court as within the bounds of acceptable police procedures, nevertheless if there was a possibility that the offence might not have been committed had the police not in some way facilitated it, that might be regarded as a matter which diminished the culpability of the offender.""

28Accordingly, The Sentencing Judge was entitled to regard the objective seriousness of the offences committed by Lipton as being diminished by the actions of the undercover police officer who brought them about.

Applicable principles

29The plurality (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ) in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [28] (Green & Quinn) explained the rationale for intervention by an appellate court, citing Gibbs CJ in Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606, who said, at 610:

""...the reason why the court interferes in such a case is that it considers that the disparity is such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, or in other words to give the appearance that justice has not been done.""

30The plurality in Green & Quinn at [31]-[32] articulated the principles to be applied by an appellate court if it considered that there was an unjustified disparity, which include, relevantly, the following:

(1)An appellate court has the power to reduce a sentence that is not manifestly excessive in order to correct a marked disparity with a sentence imposed on a co-offender. 

(2)The sense of grievance necessary to attract appellate intervention with respect to disparate sentences is to be assessed by objective criteria.

(3)An appellate court ought not intervene where disparity is justified by differences between co-offenders such as age, background, criminal history, general character and the part each has played in the relevant criminal conduct or enterprise. 

(4)An appellate court deciding an appeal against the severity of a sentence on the ground of unjustified disparity will have regard to the qualitative and discretionary judgments required of the primary judge in drawing distinctions between co-offenders.

31The applicant conceded that Lipton was not a co-offender since there was no evidence that the drugs involved in the supply by Lipton included those which were the subject of the charge to which the applicant pleaded guilty. However, he relied on the following passage in Green & Quinn, at [30]:

""In Lowe v R ([1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606) and in Postiglione v R ([1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295) this court was concerned with the application of the parity principle to persons charged with the same offences arising out of the same criminal conduct or enterprise. Those decisions are not authority for the proposition that the principle applies only to persons so charged. The foundation of the parity principle in the norm of equality before the law requires that its application be governed by consideration of substance rather than form. Formal identity of charges against the offenders whose sentences are compared is not a necessary condition of its application. Nevertheless, as Campbell JA recognised in Jimmy v R ([2010] NSWCCA 60; 77 NSWLR 540), there can be significant practical difficulties in comparing the sentences of participants in the same criminal enterprise who have been charged with different crimes. The greater the difference between the crimes, the greater the practical difficulties, particularly where disparity is said to arise out of a sentence imposed on a co-offender who has been charged with an offence that is less serious than that of the appellant. The existence of those difficulties may be accepted. So too may the inability of a court of criminal appeal to undertake, under the parity rubric, a de facto review of prosecutorial charging discretions. Those practical difficulties and limitations, however, do not exclude the operation of the parity principle. The effect given to it may vary according to the circumstances of the case, including differences between the offences with which co-offenders are charged.""

32On the basis of this passage, the applicant argued, correctly, that questions of parity and consistency are to be determined by reference to substance rather than form, and that the principles applied to the applicant and Lipton such that a comparison between their sentences was warranted to determine whether there was an unjustified disparity.

A comparison between the applicant's sentence and Lipton's

33If one removes the effect of the discount, which is a matter entirely within the discretion of the Sentencing Judge, and has regard only to the offences concerning cocaine, the 10 year term of imprisonment imposed on Lipton, was 43% greater than the 7 year term imposed on the applicant. Special circumstances were found in respect of both Lipton and the applicant. The proportion the non-parole period bore to the total overall sentence (for all offences) was 56% in the case of Lipton and 40% in the applicant's case. The applicant's non-parole period was 55% of Lipton's.

34As referred to above, the sense of grievance must be judged by reference to objective criteria. When considering the factors germane to the sentencing of those knowingly concerned in the importation of heroin, the plurality in Wong considered the matters of particular relevance to such offences and said, at 607-608:

""In relation to the offence of being knowingly concerned in the importation of heroin, like features can be identified as bearing upon the formulation of applicable principles. Those features include the difficulty of detecting the offence and the great social consequences that follow from its commission. The former suggests that deterrence is to be given chief weight in the sentencing task; the latter, that stern punishment will be warranted in almost every case. Those features will also include those that differentiate between particular cases: the quantity of drug involved, the offender's knowledge about what was being imported, the offender's role in the importation, the reward which the offender hoped to gain from participation. All these are matters properly to be taken into account in determining a sentence.""

35Although the offences to which the applicant and Lipton pleaded guilty are different from those under consideration in Wong and different from each other, they have in common that general deterrence and punishment are important considerations in sentencing offenders and will generally outweigh subjective circumstances, particularly in the determination of the total sentence. In R v Shi [2004] NSWCCA 135, Wood CJ at CL, with whom Spigelman CJ and Simpson J agreed, referred, at [34] to:

""...the well recognised principle that the culpability of those who engage, at any level, in drug supply networks is significant, and that deterrent sentences are necessary, since absent the involvement of couriers, warehousemen and so on, these networks, whether established for the purposes of importation or subsequent distribution, would simply collapse: R v Le Cerf (1975) 13 SASR 237 and R v Laurentio and Becheru (1962) 63 A Crim R 402.""

36No challenge is made to the findings of the Sentencing Judge as to the applicant's role. The differences between the sentences imposed on the applicant and on Lipton were substantial, both as to total term and as to non-parole period. While the applicant may harbour a sense of grievance about the relationship between his own sentence and Lipton's, I do not consider his sense of grievance to be justified by any identified objective criteria.

37I propose the following orders:

(1)Leave to appeal granted.

(2)Appeal dismissed.

		04 February 2013",2013-01-31 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2707177,AMZ v R [2013] NSWCCA 6,"Judgment
1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Adamson J.
2LATHAM J: I agree with Adamson J.
3ADAMSON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on him in the District Court by Berman DCJ on 2 December 2011.
4In August 2010, the applicant became involved in an organised criminal syndicate. Initially, he arranged for money to be transported from Perth to Sydney. By November 2010, the applicant was involved in supplying large commercial quantities of prohibited drugs. This involvement continued until his arrest on 15 February 2011.
5Upon arrest the applicant made admissions and assisted police by providing valuable information about the syndicate in which he had participated.
6The applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court and appeared in the District Court for sentence. The offences for which the applicant pleaded guilty, and the sentences imposed by the Sentencing Judge are summarised below:
Period of offendingOffenceMax penaltySNPPSentence, taking into account 55% discount and special circumstances1 Oct 2010 -15 Feb 2011Participate in a criminal group: Crimes Act 1900 s 93T5 yearsNone2 years fixed term, starting 15 Feb 20119 Nov 2010 - 13 Nov 2010Supply large commercial quantity of prohibited drug, 6kg methylamphetamine: Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (DMTA) s 25Life15 years9 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years, starting 15 Feb 201126 Nov 2010 - 1 Dec 2010Supply large commercial quantity of prohibited drug, 6kg methylamphetamine: DMTA s 25 Life15 years14 Dec 2010 - 20 Dec 2010Supply large commercial quantity of prohibited drug, 1.05kg heroin: DMTA s 25Life15 years6 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years, starting 15 Feb 201214 Dec 2010 - 20 Dec 2010Supply large commercial quantity of prohibited drug, 6kg methylamphetamine: DMTA s 25Life15 years9 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years, starting 15 Feb 201212 Feb 2011 - 15 Feb 2011Supply large commercial quantity of prohibited drug, 10kg methylamphetamine: DMTA s 25Life15 yearsTaking into account the Form 1 offences (listed below) 11 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years, starting 15 Feb 2013
7The applicant asked the Sentencing Judge to take into account the following offences on a Form 1 when sentencing on the final drug offence listed above:
(1)Possess prescribed restricted substance, namely anabolic steroids, contrary to s 16 of the Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act 1966; and
(2)Deal with the proceeds of crime, namely $16,500, contrary to s 193C of the Crimes Act.
8The total sentence was thirteen years commencing on 15 February 2011 and expiring on 14 February 2024, with a non-parole period of 9 years expiring on 14 February 2020.
9But for the reduction of 55%, the total sentence would have been for a period of 29 years, with a non-parole period of 20 years.
10The Sentencing Judge imposed individual non-parole periods of between 63% and 65% and an overall non-parole period of 69% of the total sentence. 
Grounds of appeal
11The grounds of appeal are:
(1)The Sentencing Judge erred in unduly constraining his discretion to discount the sentence on the basis of the applicant's plea and the assistance offered.
(2)The Sentencing Judge failed to record the reasons for finding special circumstances, contrary to s 44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
(3)The Sentencing Judge failed to take into account, adequately, the limited nature of the role performed by the applicant.
(4)The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.
The first ground: the discount for plea and assistance
12Section 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act requires a Court to take into account when passing sentence on an offender who has pleaded guilty, the fact of, and circumstances surrounding, the plea. Section 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act confers a power on the Sentencing Judge to reduce the penalty that he or she would otherwise impose on an offender having regard to the degree of assistance provided, or to be provided, by the offender. Section 23(2) provides that such lesser penalty must not be:
""unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.""
13From the time of his arrest on 15 February 2011, the applicant provided police with details of his involvement, and that of others, in the syndicate. He furnished police with information that they might not otherwise have been able to obtain, which assisted them to intercept communications. He offered to give evidence against members of the syndicate. The Sentencing Judge said, in the Remarks on Sentence (ROS):
""This is high level assistance. I will not say it is unknown, but assistance at this level is uncommon. It was immediate, comprehensive and useful. It has led to there being genuine risks to the offender's safety whilst he is in custody and upon his eventual release.""
14The Sentencing Judge also referred in the ROS to the ""enormous assistance"" that the applicant has provided to authorities and his promise to do ""even more"". The Sentencing Judge referred to the need to ensure that the discount for plea and assistance was not so great that the ultimate sentence does not bear a reasonable relationship to the criminality of the offender's conduct.
15The applicant contended, before the Sentencing Judge, that the appropriate discount was 60%. The Crown did not make submissions against this figure on the basis that the selection of the percentage discount was ultimately a discretionary matter for the Sentencing Judge. The reasons for his Honour's selection of the figure of 55% largely appear from the following passage from the ROS:
""I confess to being unable to see how, if a person is required to serve only 40% of the sentence that they would otherwise have to serve absent plea and assistance, how that sentence can ever not be unreasonably disproportionate to the circumstances of the offence.
I note that, on occasions, the Court of Criminal Appeal itself has discounted sentences by 60 % and I have to recognise that they are superior to me. I have decided that the sentence that I will impose will be 55 % less than it would otherwise have been.""
16The basis for the applicant's submission that the Sentencing Judge unduly constrained his discretion appears to be that his Honour refused to countenance the discount of 60% for which the applicant contended. 
17It may be accepted that there are some restrictions on discounts for assistance and pleas. As Howie J, with whom Simpson J agreed, said in SZ v R [2007] NSWCCA 19; 168 A Crim R 249 at [4]:
""There...[is] a bottom line beneath which a sentence cannot legitimately be set. If that bottom line is not respected, the sentence will fail to carry out the purposes of punishment.""
18However, the ""bottom line"" did not need to be explored in the instant case. It is, in my view, apparent from the passage set out above, that his Honour accepted that it was within the range of his discretion that a discount of 60% be applied, since he specifically referred to the authority of this Court and the circumstance that at times such a discount has been applied by this Court. The Sentencing Judge's decision to select 55% rather than 60% as contended for, was, in my view, an unremarkable exercise of discretion.
Further ground: evidence of further assistance
19At the hearing of the leave application, the applicant sought to make out a further ground in support of a greater discount for plea and assistance than 55%. He contended that the material before the Sentencing Judge as to the way in which the applicant assisted police had not been as expansive as is presently available to this Court. In support of this submission, the applicant relied on Springer v R [2007] NSWCCA 289; 177 A Crim R 13 (Springer).
20The applicant in Springer had, upon arrest, co-operated with police and made full admissions as to his involvement and to the involvement of others engaged in drug importation. At the time of sentence, the police assessed the worth of Springer's assistance as only of ""intelligence value"" rather than as potentially assisting in the apprehension and prosecution of other suspects. He was, accordingly, sentenced on that basis. However, Spring continued to assist after the imposition of the sentence. His assistance result in further investigations, the arrest of a suspect and the possible arrest of others. On his application for leave to appeal, Springer sought to introduce the post-sentence events as ""fresh evidence"".  As a result, this Court decided that Springer's assistance had been, with the benefit of hindsight, underestimated. Consequently, Springer was re-sentenced and an overall discount of 50% was allowed for all assistance, past and present.
21In support of his application before this Court, the applicant tendered, through the Crown, material which was before the Sentencing Judge as to the assistance which had been offered and provided by him and an undertaking to provide assistance, including to give evidence as a Crown witness in future court proceedings against the persons named in the document. The material before the Sentencing Judge listed the persons who had been arrested and charged as a result of the assistance given by the applicant and those in respect of whom he had undertaken to give evidence.
22The material relied upon before this Court as to the assistance provided and promised by the applicant was substantially the same as that before the Sentencing Judge, apart from the addition of a further name of a person said to be a person of interest, against whom the applicant had undertaken to give evidence as a Crown witness.
23I do not consider this so-called ""fresh"" material to be of the calibre adverted to by this Court in Springer. Unlike in Springer, the Sentencing Judge correctly assessed, even with the benefit of hindsight, the value of the assistance provided, and to be provided, by the applicant. His Honour assessed it on the footing that it had led to the arrest and charging of suspects and could lead to the successful prosecution of such persons. I do not consider this new ground to establish any proper basis for this Court to re-sentence the applicant by altering the overall discount for plea and assistance.
The second ground: alleged failure to give reasons for finding special circumstances
24The applicant submitted that, although it could be assumed from the rate between the non-parole period and the head sentence that the Sentencing Judge had found special circumstances, his Honour fell into error by not explaining the basis of such a finding. He contended that this Court ought re-exercise the discretion to diminish the ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence even further.
25A judge is not required to make express findings about every matter germane to the decision absent a statutory provision which requires it. It will be sufficient if a finding is appropriately clear by inference: Selvanayagam v University of West Indies [1983] 1 WLR 585 at 587-588.
26Section 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act relevantly provides:
""The balance of the term of the sentence must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period for the sentence, unless the court decides that there are special circumstances for it being more (in which case the court must make a record of reasons for its decision).""
27The statutory requirement is that the Sentencing Judge give reasons for any finding of special circumstances.
28The ROS were delivered on the same day as the sentence hearing following a short adjournment after the conclusion of the evidence.  The applicant contended in written submissions that several factors warranted a finding of special circumstances: conditions in custody, accumulation, youth and good prospects of rehabilitation. The Sentencing Judge made specific findings about the factors relied upon by the applicant.
29That the Sentencing Judge fixed a ratio between the non-parole period and the total term for each offence and for the offences in aggregate which was less than 75% gives rise to an implicit finding of special circumstances. I would not readily conclude that his Honour's application of a percentage lower than 75% was unwitting, as distinct from a proper exercise of discretion following the Sentencing Judge being satisfied that there were special circumstances. In this context, the fact that the Sentencing Judge did not make an express finding of special circumstances, does not undermine the conclusion that his Honour considered the question of special circumstances and was satisfied that special circumstances had been established. Furthermore, in my view his Honour gave reasons for the implicit finding of special circumstances because he made findings about the facts put forward as warranting such a finding.
30I consider his Honour's reasons to be sufficient to indicate to the parties and to this Court the basis of his finding of special circumstances: Housing Commission of NSW v Tatmar Pastoral Co (1983) 3 NSWLR 378 at 386F, per Mahoney JA. I consider that in all the circumstances the Sentencing Judge complied with the obligation imposed by s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
31In any event, Parliament specifically contemplated that reasons might not be given for a finding of special circumstances and provided that the non-compliance with s 44(2) did not have the effect of vitiating the sentence: s 44(3).
32For these reasons, this ground fails.
Additional ground: application of discount to non-parole period
33At the hearing of the application, the applicant raised a further ground, namely that it was not clear from the reasons the extent to which the 55% discount had been applied and, in particular, whether it had been taken into account only in respect of the head sentence, or whether it had also affected the length of the non-parole period.
34I do not consider there to be any substance in this ground.  The discount was required to be applied to the total length of the sentence.  Once the length of the sentence had been determined having regard to the discount, the effect of the discount was spent.  The Sentencing Judge was then required to consider whether there were special circumstances and if so, whether the non-parole period should be reduced to a period less than 75% of the total discount. His Honour did so and set the non-parole period accordingly.

Third ground: the Sentencing Judge failed to take account of the limited role played by the applicant 
35The Sentencing Judge's findings about the applicant's role, which were not challenged, appear in the following passage in the ROS:
""Some attention has been made in submissions to the offender's role.  Perhaps the best description is one adopted by the Crown.  He acted as the personal assistant to the principal.  It goes without saying that he was not a principal, but his role was much higher in the hierarchy than a mere courier.  On the other hand, as Mr Lange points out, it appears that what the offender did was at the direction of others.  I cannot recall anything in the statement of facts which suggests that the offender has exercised any independent or innovative thought about this drug supply business.  He did what others told him to do.  But he did those things enthusiastically and he did them well.""
36The applicant was not addicted to drugs, and became involved purely for financial gain. He was 24 years old when the offences were committed.
37As the Sentencing Judge said:
""The authorities suggest that this is the most serious form of drug supplier, a person who did this for financial reward.""
38Nonetheless, the applicant's rewards were not substantial compared with others higher up in the syndicate. 
39There is no challenge to the Sentencing Judge's findings of fact about the applicant's role. No error has been shown in his Honour's assessment. I do not consider there to be any merit in the suggestion that his Honour did not adequately take into account the applicant's role.
Fourth ground: the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive
40As can be seen from the table at the commencement of these reasons, the five drug offences each carry a maximum life sentence and a standard non-parole period of 15 years. These legislative guideposts provide an indication of the seriousness with which Parliament views such offences: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [27].
41Each offence involved not less than a ""large commercial quantity"". The prescribed quantity for ""large commercial quantity"" for each relevant drug, methylamphetamine and heroin, was 1 kg. The quantity of heroin supplied was, at 1.05 kg, slightly in excess of a large commercial quantity but the quantities of methylamphetamine were substantially in excess of the threshold. The value of the drugs was substantial. All of the supply offences took place within a three-month period. 
42There can be no doubt as to the objective seriousness of the offences to which the applicant pleaded guilty. As can be seen from the table, the first three sentences ran concurrently. The fourth sentence is subsumed in the first. There was limited accumulation of two years in total.
43The Sentencing Judge considered the applicant's subjective circumstances in a manner which was not said to involve error. I do not consider any of the individual sentences or the total sentence imposed to be other than within the range of an appropriate exercise of discretion.
44I propose the following orders:
(1)Grant leave to appeal.
(2)Dismiss the appeal.

(b)Count 2: That on 1 February 2009 at Maitland the Appellant did have sexual intercourse (penile-vaginal sex) with the Complainant without her consent, knowing she was not consenting.

(c)Count 3: That on 7 February 2009 at Maitland the Appellant did have sexual intercourse (penile-vaginal sex) with the Complainant without her consent, knowing she was not consenting.

4The Appellant was convicted by a jury in the District Court at East Maitland on 18 August 2010, following a nine-day trial.

5On 16 December 2010, the Appellant was sentenced in respect of the offences. Each count carried a maximum penalty of 14 years' imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of seven years.

6The Appellant was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of six years and six months, with a non-parole period of four years. That sentence comprised the following:

(a) Count 1: Non-parole period of three years commencing on 18 August 2010 and expiring on 17 August 2013, with a balance of term of two years commencing on 18 August 2013 and expiring on 17 August 2015.

(b) Count 2: Non-parole period of three years and six months commencing on 18 August 2010 and expiring on 17 February 2014, with a balance of term of two years and six months commencing on 18 February 2014 and expiring on 17 August 2016.

(c) Count 3: Non-parole period of three years and six months commencing on 18 February 2011 and expiring on 17 August 2014, with a balance of term of two years and six months commencing on 18 August 2014 and expiring on 17 February 2017.

Grounds of Appeal

7The Appellant seeks leave to appeal against his convictions pursuant to s.5(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Two grounds of appeal have been advanced:

(a) that the verdicts were unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence; and

(b) that the trial miscarried by reason of (a) the failure of the Appellant's legal representatives to adduce evidence of the Complainant's telephone records, (b) the failure of the Appellant's counsel to cross-examine the Complainant on the telephone records, (c) the Crown Prosecutor's cross-examination of the Appellant on his telephone records, and (d) the Crown Prosecutor's inappropriate remarks about the Appellant's defence.

8As neither ground of appeal involves a ""question of law alone"", the Appellant requires leave to appeal against his convictions: s.5(1)(b) Criminal Appeal Act 1912; Rasic v R [2009] NSWCCA 202 at [12]. 

9The Crown did not oppose the grant of leave. Having regard to this, and the arguability of the grounds advanced by the Appellant, it is appropriate for leave to be granted.

10There is no application for leave to appeal against sentence.

Brief Factual Overview

11The following basic facts are not in dispute in these proceedings. They provide a background to the contested events which gave rise to the Appellant's convictions. 

12The Appellant is an Iraqi national who has been living in Australia with his family since 1999. He was about 44 years of age in February 2009.

13The Complainant was born in the Philippines. She came to Australia with her husband, who is Australian, in 1995. She was about 39 or 40 years of age in February 2009. 

14At all relevant times, the Appellant was the cleaners' supervisor at the Pender Place Shopping Centre in Maitland, New South Wales (""the shopping centre""). The Appellant was employed by Glad Retail Cleaning Pty Limited.

15The Complainant worked for the Appellant as a cleaner at the shopping centre between 25 January 2009 and 10 February 2009. This was her first employment in Australia.

16The Appellant employed two cleaners, one for the day shift and one for the night shift. The day-shift cleaner worked from 7.00 am to 3.00 pm Monday to Saturday, and 8.00 am to 3.00 pm on Sundays. The night-shift cleaner worked from 3.00 pm to 11.00 pm Monday to Saturday, and 3.00 pm to 10.00 pm on Sundays.

17In January 2009, the Appellant offered Loida Reynolds a job as the day-shift cleaner. Ms Reynolds did not accept the position; however, she informed the Appellant that the Complainant may be interested in it. The Appellant and the Complainant met on 23 January 2009 to discuss the position. Ms Reynolds was also present. The Complainant accepted the job on 24 January 2009 after conferring with her husband.

18The Complainant and Ms Reynolds had been friends for approximately eight or 10 years. Ms Reynolds was also from the Philippines. The Complainant and Ms Reynolds both spoke some English. However, it appears they conversed in their native language when speaking with one another. 

19The Complainant commenced work on Saturday, 25 January 2009.

20It was the Complainant's usual practice to receive a lift to work from her husband. 

21The Appellant was not always present at the shopping centre when the Complainant was working. The Appellant resided in Sydney with his family and would travel back and forth a number of times each week between Sydney and Maitland. When in Maitland, he would sleep in his office at the shopping centre.

22The Complainant was called into the Appellant's office some time during the morning of Friday, 30 January 2009 for a meeting. A discussion was had during which the Appellant enquired as to how the Complainant was finding the job. He also showed her pictures of his children.

23During the evening of 30 January 2009, the Complainant attended a disco at the Belmont 16 Footers Sailing Club with the Appellant, Ms Reynolds, and Ms Reynolds' daughter.

24The offences contained in Counts 1 and 2 on the indictment occurred on Saturday, 1 February 2009. Count 3 occurred on Sunday, 7 February 2009.

25The events that gave rise to all counts occurred in the cleaners' room at the shopping centre, shortly after the Appellant and the Complainant arrived for work. The Appellant did not dispute that sexual intercourse took place between the Appellant and the Complainant on each of these occasions. However, the Appellant asserted that these were consensual sexual acts.

26There was telephone contact between the Appellant and the Complainant late in the evening on the days on which the sexual acts took place. Telephone contact continued between them in the form of calls and text messages throughout the term of the Complainant's employment.

27The Complainant's employment was terminated by the Appellant on 10 February 2009. There was a live issue at the trial concerning the reason for the Complainant's dismissal.

28The Complainant did not, at any point, receive payment for the work she performed whilst an employee at the shopping centre.

29Immediately following her termination on 10 February 2009, the Complainant reported the assaults to Ms Reynolds. The Complainant attended Toronto Police Station later the same day where she spoke with Detective Sergeant Mark Dixon. That evening, she attended the John Hunter Hospital with her husband and was examined by Dr Matthew Holland.

The Crown Case

30The Crown case was based largely on the oral evidence of the Complainant. Other witnesses who gave evidence in the Crown case were Ms Reynolds, Dr Holland, Naveen Lingaiah (Client Services Manager for Glad Retail Cleaning Pty Limited), Brad Muller (Ms Reynolds' de facto partner), and Detective Sergeant Mark Dixon.

31Several exhibits were also tendered as part of the Crown case. These included maps and diagrams of the shopping centre and surrounding area, as well as photographs of the cleaners' room. Of some significance to this appeal, photocopies of a notebook containing records of the Complainant's start and finish times were also in evidence (Exhibit C).

32The Complainant and Ms Reynolds gave evidence in the Crown case with the assistance of an interpreter.

33It was the Crown case that the Appellant and the Complainant were merely colleagues, and that the Complainant was not romantically interested in the Appellant. 

34The Crown contended that the Appellant made sexual advances towards the Complainant on 30 January 2009 prior to the assaults, each of which were rejected by the Complainant.

35The first sexual advance formed part of an additional incident alleged to have occurred in the Appellant's office at the shopping centre during his meeting with the Complainant on the morning of 30 January 2009. This incident allegedly involved the Appellant exposing himself to the Complainant and asking her to perform fellatio. Objection was taken to this evidence by the Appellant's trial counsel, and the trial Judge ruled that it was inadmissible. I will return to this topic, which is relevant to the second ground of appeal. 

36The second sexual advance took place at the disco that was attended by the Appellant and the Complainant later that evening. At some point during the evening while they were seated next to each other, the Crown alleged that the Appellant placed his hand on the Complainant's leg and proceeded to rub it. The Complainant pushed the Appellant's hand away. The Appellant denied that this incident occurred.

Count 1

37The Crown alleged the following series of events with respect to Count 1.

38The Complainant was not originally supposed to work on 1 February 2009. The Appellant telephoned her late on the previous evening, asking her to work the next day. The Complainant informed the Appellant that she would have to catch a train, and that she would require a lift from the station to the shopping centre. The Appellant agreed to this request.

39The Complainant caught a train that left at 5.10 am. The Appellant picked her up from the station at East Maitland at approximately 6.45 am. This was about one hour before she was required to start work.

40Shortly after they arrived at the shopping centre, the Appellant asked the Complainant to come to his office. The Complainant told the Appellant that she needed to get changed for work. She then went to the cleaners' room alone to get changed, locking the door behind her. 

41As she was getting undressed, the Complainant heard the door unlock and she saw the Appellant enter the cleaners' room. The Complainant asked the Appellant to leave, to which the Appellant responded, ""Be quiet"".

42The Appellant began kissing the Complainant's back and neck. He did not stop despite her protestations. The Appellant exposed himself to the Complainant and asked her to perform fellatio, a request that she refused. The Appellant then pulled down his trousers, took the Complainant's hand, and sat down in a chair. The Appellant placed his hand on the back of the Complainant's head and pushed her head down onto his erect penis. The Appellant pushed his penis into her mouth about four times.

Count 2

43Count 2 followed immediately after Count 1. The Crown alleged the following events occurred.

44Situated next to the chair in which the Appellant was sitting was a table. The Appellant picked the Complainant up and lifted her onto the table. The Complainant was not strong enough to push him off. The Appellant climbed on top of the Complainant and inserted his penis inside her vagina. She told the Appellant to stop two or three times, but he kept going. After moving his penis inside the Complainant's vagina about three or four times, the Appellant ejaculated inside the Complainant.

45The Appellant then got dressed. The Complainant said, ""You bastard, don't do that again"". The Appellant did not respond. He instructed the Complainant to get dressed and then left the cleaners' room. The Complainant felt shocked. 

46The Complainant continued to work that day. At about 11.00 am, the Appellant bought the Complainant a coffee. The Complainant enquired of the Appellant as to how many women he had been with, as he had not worn a condom and the Complainant was concerned about contracting a sexually transmitted disease. The Appellant did not respond.

47The Complainant finished work at 3.00 pm.

48That evening, the Complainant did not inform her husband of what happened at work, as she was worried that he might retaliate on her behalf. The Complainant slept in a separate bed from her husband that night as she felt ""dirty"".

49The Complainant telephoned Ms Reynolds at some point during the evening. Ms Reynolds was unable to talk and she instructed the Complainant that she would call her back later. This did not occur.

Count 3

50The events giving rise to Count 3 occurred about one week after Counts 1 and 2.

51The Complainant was driven to work by her husband that day. When she arrived at work, she went to the cleaners' room alone and locked the door.

52As the Complainant proceeded to get undressed, she heard the door unlock. The Complainant again saw the Appellant enter the cleaners' room. The Complainant said to the Appellant, ""Please go out it's not going to happen again"", to which the Appellant replied, ""Be quiet it won't take long"". The Complainant responded, ""No, no, I can't take it anymore, I could not look at my husband"".

53The Appellant approached the Complainant and began kissing her neck and breast. She asked him to stop. The Appellant asked the Complainant to perform fellatio on him, which she refused. The Appellant then sat down on a pile of cleaning towels and lowered his trousers, exposing his erect penis. He said to the Complainant, ""Come on, suck it"". The Complainant again refused.

54The Appellant stood up, placed both his hands on the Complainant's back underneath her arms, and bent the Complainant over a pile of rags. The Appellant pulled the Complainant's underpants halfway down her legs. She tried to push him away, but was not strong enough.

55The Appellant then inserted his penis inside the Complainant's vagina from behind. She was in pain and screamed. The Appellant used his left hand to cover the Complainant's mouth, and told her to be quiet. The Appellant then ejaculated inside the Complainant.

56The Appellant got dressed and told the Complainant to do the same. He said to the Complainant, ""Don't tell anyone"". He then left the room. The Complainant wiped herself with a towel and placed it on top of the pile of rags. She then got dressed and resumed work. She could not recall whether she had any further contact with the Appellant that day.

57Given submissions advanced on behalf of the Appellant in this Court, it is appropriate to observe that the Crown did not dispute that there was telephone contact between the Appellant and the Complainant during the course of the Complainant's employment (including the communication on 1 and 7 February 2009). Instead, the Crown contended that whatever conversations took place between them were of a work-related nature.

The Appellant's Case at Trial

58The Appellant did not deny that he engaged in sexual intercourse with the Complainant. The sole issue at trial was consent. 

59The Appellant's case at trial consisted of the oral evidence of the Appellant, as well as the Appellant's telephone records (Exhibits D and E). The entries in the telephone records indicate calls made from the Appellant's telephone only (they do not show incoming calls). For reasons discussed below, the Complainant's telephone records were not part of the evidence before the jury.

60Like the Complainant and Ms Reynolds, the Appellant also gave evidence with the assistance of an interpreter.

61It was the Appellant's case at trial, that the Complainant had expressed romantic feelings towards him, and that the two of them were in a burgeoning relationship. It was also asserted that Ms Reynolds had told the Appellant that the Complainant admired him. This was denied by Ms Reynolds.

62The Appellant contended that he and the Complainant engaged in intimate and personal conversations late at night, a factor that was said to evince the nature of the relationship between them.

63In relation to each count on the indictment, the Appellant asserted that the intercourse was consensual. On the occasions on which intercourse took place, the Appellant maintained that he and the Complainant entered the cleaners' room at the shopping centre together. The reason for this, it was suggested, was because the Complainant did not have a key and the Appellant was required to unlock the door for the Complainant. The Complainant denied this fact, asserting that she had her own set of keys. Mr Lingaiah provided evidence corroborating the Complainant's assertion.

64In respect of Count 1, the Appellant's case was that the Complainant commenced undressing whilst in his presence in the cleaners' room, shortly after they arrived for work. The Complainant asked to see his penis, and they performed oral sex on each other for a period of a few minutes. They then engaged in penile-vaginal intercourse on the table in the cleaners' room. After the intercourse, the Complainant told the Appellant that he had ejaculated too quickly. 

65The Appellant asserted that, during the telephone conversation that took place later that evening, the Complaint told him she was happy about what happened earlier that day.

66There was a further incident that formed part of the Appellant's case at trial. This occurred a few days after Counts 1 and 2. This incident involved the Complainant making a telephone call to the Appellant at approximately 6.15 am, during which the Appellant informed the Complainant that he was asleep. When he enquired with the Complainant at work later that day as to why she had called, the Complainant told him she wished to have another ""physical get together"". The Complainant denied this. The telephone records did not support the Appellant on this issue.

67In respect of Count 3, the Appellant again maintained that he and the Complainant had undressed together in the cleaners' room. The Complainant then bent over, placing her hands against the wall, and said to the Appellant, ""insert it inside me"".

68During the intercourse, the Complainant told the Appellant to be quiet so that people next door would not hear them.

69After the intercourse had finished, the Complainant again told the Appellant that he had ejaculated too quickly. He told the Complainant, ""Next time we'll go to a hotel or motel"".

70During the telephone conversation of that evening, the Complainant told the Appellant that she had just had a whiskey and was thinking about him.

71As regards the termination of the Complainant's employment, the reason cited by the Appellant was that he was informed by the Complainant that she needed an operation, and that she required extended time off work both before and afterward. This was denied by the Complainant. The Complainant's version was that she reminded the Appellant on 10 February 2009 that she had a doctor's appointment scheduled for 23 February 2009, and that she would only have to miss one day of work (she asserted that the Appellant already knew of the appointment).

Ground 1: The Verdicts Were Unreasonable or Cannot Be Supported by the Evidence

72The Appellant asserts that the Crown case depended entirely or substantially on the evidence of the Complainant. 

73It was submitted on the Appellant's behalf that the Complainant's evidence lacked credibility for five reasons. These reasons formed the basis of five submissions under the first ground of appeal, namely:

(a) Submission 1: That on the morning of Sunday, 1 February 2009, the Complainant arrived for work approximately one hour early, and requested a lift from the Appellant, notwithstanding sexual advances having been made by the Appellant towards her on the previous Friday evening.

(b) Submission 2: That records of telephone calls made between the Appellant and the Complainant, especially during the evenings of 1 February and 7 February 2009, are inconsistent with the Complainant's account of the nature of their relationship.

(c) Submission 3: That the Complainant continued to change in the cleaners' room at the shopping centre after 1 February 2009 in circumstances where she knew the Appellant had a key and where she could have changed in the adjacent public toilets.

(d) Submission 4: That the Complainant gave an inconsistent account of the sexual activity which occurred between the Appellant and the Complainant on 7 February 2009; 

(e) Submission 5: That the sexual assault complaint was only made after the Complainant had been dismissed from her employment.

74The Appellant submits that, in light of the lack of credibility of the Complainant's evidence, and the significant part the Complainant's evidence played in the Crown case, the verdicts of guilty on each count were unreasonable or cannot be supported.

The Relevant Legal Principles

75Section 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provides that, in respect of an appeal under s.5(1), the Court of Criminal Appeal ""shall allow the appeal if it is of the opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence"".

76The task of the Court in determining an appeal of this sort was summarised in Raumakita v R [2011] NSWCCA 126; 210 A Crim R 326 at 332-333 [31]-[34]:

""31 In determining a ground of appeal which asserts, for the purpose of s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912, that the verdict was unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, this Court is required to apply the test set down in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 493, and restated in MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606. The Court is to make an independent assessment of the evidence, both to its sufficiency and quality. This involves a question of fact. The Court is to determine whether the evidence is such that it was open to a jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant was guilty. The central question is whether this Court is satisfied that the Appellant is guilty of the offence charged in the first count: Morris v The Queen [1987] HCA 50; 163 CLR 454 at 473; SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 85 ALJR 571 at 575 [11]-[14], 576-577 [20]-[22]. 

32 In exercising that function, the evidence ought not be considered piecemeal: The Queen v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; 228 CLR 618 at 637-638 [46]-[48]; The Queen v Keenan [2009] HCA 1; 236 CLR 397 at 435 [128]. This Court is required to consider the totality of evidence before the jury. This involves an assessment of direct evidence of witnesses, and inferences to be drawn from a combination of events: Rasic v R at [29]. 

33 In some cases, the fact that the Court of Criminal Appeal has not seen or heard the witnesses at trial may have a bearing on the outcome of an appeal on an unreasonable verdict ground. In M v The Queen, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson Toohey JJ said at 494-495: 

'In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. In doing so, the court is not substituting trial by a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. Although the propositions stated in the four preceding sentences have been variously expressed in judgments of members of the court in previous cases, we have put aside those differences in expression in order to provide authoritative guidance to courts of criminal appeal by stating the propositions in the form in which they are set out above.'

34 The M v The Queen formulation of the task of this Court has been emphasised by the High Court in later cases: The Queen v Nguyen [2010] HCA 38; 85 ALJR 8 at 14 [33]; SKA v The Queen at 575 [13].""

77It is appropriate to consider in turn each of the five submissions (see [73] above]) advanced in support of this ground.

78In approaching these submissions, I keep in mind that the experience of the criminal courts has been that victims of sexual assault do not necessarily respond in ways that accord with some mechanical or predetermined view as to how such victims should respond. Much depends on the evidence in the particular case, including the association of the parties and the duration of that association. I will return to this topic later in the judgment.

Submission 1

79The Appellant asserts that it was inconsistent with the Complainant's account of the nature of her relationship with the Appellant for her to, firstly, arrive for work approximately one hour early on 1 February 2009 and, secondly, request a lift from the Appellant, in light of his supposedly unwanted sexual advances on the previous Friday night.

80The Complainant gave the following account of her understanding of the nature of her relationship with the Appellant during cross-examination (T32, 11 August 2010):

""Q. Every day that he was there, you would talk to each other?
A. WITNESS: When I got break time, he come up.

Q. And is it true that just about every day that you worked at Pender Place, that [the Appellant] would bring you coffee in the morning? Is that right?
A. WITNESS: He bought me a coffee, yes.

Q. And you'd have a chat? You'd talk to each other?
A. WITNESS: Yes.

Q. And you were becoming friendly?
A. WITNESS: Yes

Q. And you liked [the Appellant]?
A. WITNESS: No.

Q. You thought he was a nice guy?
A. WITNESS: The first time I know, I think he's nice, but, no.

Q. When did you decide that he wasn't nice?
A. WITNESS: When the first time? When he asked me to go to the office the Friday the 31st - 30th.""

81The Complainant maintained throughout cross-examination that, whilst she and the Appellant spoke to each other at work regularly, they were merely colleagues. 

82Contrary to this, it was the Appellant's case at trial that the Complainant had expressed romantic feelings towards him, as to which the Appellant gave the following account during evidence-in-chief (T31, 16 August 2010):

""Q. Okay. Now, while you were at the club that evening was there anything said to you by [Ms Reynolds], anything else said to you by [Ms Reynolds], about [the Complainant]?
A. INTERPRETER: She said to me '[the Complainant] admires you'.

Q. And had anything been said to you by [the Complainant] or [Ms Reynolds] or anybody else prior to that as to how [the Complainant] felt about you?
A. INTERPRETER: [Ms Reynolds] told me, yes.

Q. And had [the Complainant] said anything to you? 
A. INTERPRETER: She said, 'I'm fond of you. Your eyes are beautiful and your eye lashes are smacking.'

HIS HONOUR: Sorry, I missed that.

INTERPRETER: 'Your eye lashes are smacking.'

HIS HONOUR: Smacking.

INTERPRETER: Makes the heart throb.

Q. Okay and when did [the Complainant] say that to you?
A. INTERPRETER: At work.
 
Q. At work and was it before you went to the club or after?
A. INTERPRETER: No, before we went to the club.""

83Ms Reynolds denied telling the Appellant that the Complainant had romantic feelings for him. To her knowledge, the Complainant did not have feelings of that kind for the Appellant (T37-38, 13 August 2010). In cross-examination, the Complainant could not recall telling the Appellant he had beautiful eyes (T32, 11 August 2010). Further, she denied that her reason for attending the disco on the Friday night was that she was developing romantic feelings for the Appellant (T33, 11 August 2010).

84I turn now to the sexual advances made towards the Complainant at the disco and the Complainant's later request of a lift to the shopping centre. 

85The Crown argued, in written submissions, that the Complainant was entitled to interpret the Appellant's advances, at the time, as an isolated incident, and one that was not of a sinister nature. Thus, it was submitted, it was not unreasonable for her to request a lift from the Appellant for the short trip from the train station to the shopping centre on 1 February 2009. I accept this submission. There was no suggestion of any force on the Appellant's behalf when the Complainant rejected his advances. Thus, the Complainant ought not to have felt threatened by the Appellant at this point. 

86Furthermore, the Complainant swiftly rejected the advances, indicating that they were not welcome and affirming that she was not romantically interested in the Appellant. Importantly, this was the first time the Complainant had to catch a train to work. These facts are significant as they make it much more likely that the Complainant's request of a lift from the Appellant was a matter of convenience only. The jury was likely to have reasoned in this way, and I do as well.

87The Complainant was asked in cross-examination why she caught a train to arrive for work approximately one hour early on 1 February 2009 (T6-9, 12 August 2010):

""Q. And my question is why did you arrive at work so early on the Sunday morning?
A. WITNESS: Because I had to catch the train, maybe I'm going too late. Is no other train to - the next train is about - I'm too late to work, about something eight.

Q. What are you telling us, that on Sunday morning to get to Maitland by quarter to eight you have to catch a train at Waratah at ten past five? Is that what your evidence is?
A. WITNESS: Yes

Q. There's no train after ten past five that will get you to Maitland station by quarter to eight? Is that your evidence?
A. WITNESS: I'm not sure that one. I'm not sure that one.

Q. Well what I'm putting to you is that there was no need for you to get to work at 6.45 on that Sunday morning, was there, as far as work was concerned?
A. WITNESS: I always be early when I go to work. I always.

Q. You see, I put this to you, that the reason that you arrived early on that Sunday morning, an hour before you had to start work, was so that you could spend some time with [the Appellant]?
A. WITNESS: No.

Q. What do you say to that?
A. WITNESS: No. I want to spend to work start to finish early, that's all I think, nothing to spend to with [the Appellant], no.

Q. I'm sorry, I didn't understand that. Did you say you wanted to spend time at work so you could get away early? Is that what you're saying?
A. WITNESS: To finish work early what I'm going to do it at work, not - not spend to [the Appellant]. I want to work early to finish.

Q. Well, what time did you finish that day? Have a look at your list.
A. WITNESS: Three o'clock.

Q. That's the normal finishing time isn't it?
A. WITNESS: Yes.

Q. So you didn't put down on your sheet that you started at 6.45 and you were going to go early, did you?
A. WITNESS: No, because that's only he give it to me. He said to me, 'Just put this time'.""

88Exhibit C indicates the Complainant's start and finish times for 1 February 2009. It indicates that she started work at 7.45 am, and finished at 3.00 pm. These times clearly conflict with the actual times that she started and finished work. 

89In re-examination, the Complainant asserted that, notwithstanding the hours she actually worked that day, the Appellant instructed her to write her usual start and finish times on the time sheet (T49-50, 12 August 2010). Further, the Complainant gave evidence that she in fact also started approximately one hour early on the previous Sunday, notwithstanding that Exhibit C indicated her start time to be 7.45 am (T50, 12 August 2010). 

90Whilst it is true that the Complainant's evidence concerning her start and finish times for 1 February 2009 is inconsistent with Exhibit C, it is not implausible that the Appellant could have instructed the Complainant to fill in her usual times.

91As regards the Complainant's arrival at work one hour early, the Complainant denied strenuously in cross-examination that this was for the purpose of spending time with the Appellant. She cited multiple reasons for arriving early, including a concern about being late. This was convincing in light of the fact that it was the first time she had to catch a train to work. Moreover, it does not appear that there were any discussions between the Appellant and the Complainant prior to arriving at work on 1 February 2009 indicating any intention to rendezvous for the purpose of having sexual intercourse (see T7, 17 August 2010). 

92The Complainant's description of the nature of her relationship with the Appellant was that they were merely colleagues. In my view, nothing in the Complainant's behaviour prior to or upon arriving at work on 1 February 2009 was inconsistent with that description, and the jury would have taken the same view. 

93I reject this submission.

Submission 2

94The Appellant's second submission under the first ground asserts that the telephone records between the Appellant and the Complainant are inconsistent with the Complainant's evidence as to the nature of the relationship between the two of them. Telephone calls late in the evening on the days when the assaults took place were of particular significance to this argument.

95The Complainant's evidence as to her understanding of the nature of the relationship is set out above.

96The Complainant did not give evidence-in-chief on the subject of the telephone contact between her and the Appellant. It is apparent that the Crown did not have either the Appellant's nor the Complainant's telephone records prior to trial. 

97In cross-examination, the Complainant agreed that she and the Appellant had an arrangement whereby, if she ever needed to speak with the Appellant on the telephone, she would call his mobile number, leave a missed call, and the Appellant would call her back. This was to minimise the Complainant's mobile telephone costs (T28-29, 11 August 2010).

98The Appellant's telephone records (Exhibits D and E) clearly show a significant number of telephone calls were made from the Appellant to the Complainant's mobile telephone during the course of her employment, some of which were made outside work hours. Most of the calls lasted less than a minute; however, some were of a couple of minute's duration. There were also several text messages. 

99The Complainant gave evidence during cross-examination that the nature of the telephone contact was usually work related, involving the Appellant enquiring as to the location of the mop or bucket at the shopping centre (T34, 11 August 2010; T14-15, 12 August 2010). It was the Appellant's case at trial that the calls and texts, and their timing, exhibited the intimate and personal nature of the relationship.

100Exhibits D and E show that a telephone call was made by the Appellant to the Complainant's mobile telephone shortly after 10 pm on 1 February 2009, following Counts 1 and 2. The call lasted two minutes and 14 seconds. The Complainant could not recall this conversation (T40, 11 August 2010). When shown the entry in Exhibit E corresponding to this particular call, she acknowledged that it was her mobile telephone number that received it, but could not recall what was said (T11-13, 12 August 2010):

""Q. Having looked at that document, do you now remember that you had a telephone call that night with [the Appellant]?
A. WITNESS: Yes, that's my number.

HIS HONOUR: But I don't think that's answering the question.

SUNDSTROM: I don't think it is either, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR

Q. Mrs ..., he asked having looked at that entry on the paper, do you now recall talking to [the Appellant] on that night?
A. WITNESS: I'm not sure. I think so but my number is here. I don't know.

SUNDSTROM

...

Q. I'm suggesting to you that when [the Appellant] made that telephone call that you've just looked at it was after you rang his phone and left a missed call on it and he rang you back, is that right?
A. WITNESS: Yes, sometimes he do that.

Q. Okay.

HIS HONOUR: But then again, that's not answering.

SUNDSTROM: It's not really, is it?

Q. Well, do you remember that that is what happened on this occasion? On 1 February, that evening, you rang, left a missed call and [the Appellant] rang you back; is that what happened or not? Or if you can't remember, say so?
A. WITNESS: I can't remember.

Q. All right?
A. WITNESS: Really, I can't remember. I'm really confused that night.

Q. Righto. And when you spoke to [the Appellant] that night and he rang, you said, 'I'm thinking of you and I'm really happy'?
A. WITNESS: Pardon?

Q. When you answered the phone you said, 'I am thinking of you and I am really happy'. What do you say to that?
A. WITNESS: Happy of what? I'm not happy he done to me.

...

Q. I'm sorry, I don't understand that. Do you agree that you had that conversation, that you said to [the Appellant], 'I'm thinking of you and I'm happy'?
A. WITNESS: No.""


101Exhibits D and E also show telephone contact between the Appellant and the Complainant late in the evening on 7 February 2009, following Count 3. Four calls were made from the Appellant to the Complainant, each of a duration of no longer than six seconds. The calls all occurred within a four-minute period shortly after 9.30 pm. A call was then made at 21:41:34 lasting one minute and 52 seconds. The following was put to the Complainant in cross-examination (T21-22, 12 August 2010):

""Q. On that night at about 20 to 11 [sic] you had a telephone conversation with [the Appellant], didn't you?
A. WITNESS: No, I don't know.

Q. You don't know?
A. WITNESS: No.

Q. Are you saying you didn't?
A. WITNESS: No, I don't know.

Q. Well I put to you that you did, you had a telephone conversation that went for almost two minutes and during that conversation you said to [the Appellant], 'I've just had a scotch, I'm hugging my pillow and I'm thinking of you'. What do you say to that?
A. WITNESS: Did he say that? No, no.

Q. No, that you said that to [the Appellant]?
A. WITNESS: No, I didn't said to him and I don't know if he rung - I didn't know if I rung him.

...

Q. You don't know if he rung you on 7 February?
A. WITNESS: No.

Q. That was the night after you say in that morning, [the Appellant] forced you to have sex with him, and you don't remember if he rang you that night?
A. WITNESS: No.""

102The Appellant placed particular significance on the timing of the telephone contact on these days; both in terms of it being outside work hours and on days on which assaults were said to have occurred. The Complainant was asked why, on the very evenings following occasions on which she said she was forced to engage in sexual activity with the Appellant, she engaged in conversations of a couple of minutes in duration. It was put to the Complainant that the telephone calls were in fact made because the Complainant had been a willing participant in the sexual intercourse, that she was happy about it, and that she wanted to speak to the Appellant. The Complainant denied all of this (T23-24, 12 August 2010).

103In this regard, it ought be borne in mind that telephone calls and text messages were also made outside work hours on other days during the course of the Complainant's employment. Some of these calls also lasted more than a couple of minutes. The relevant days on which this communication took place were 25 January, 31 January, and 5 February 2009 (see Exhibits D and E). This reduces the weight of the Appellant's argument concerning the telephone calls on 1 February and 7 February 2009. In addition, the Crown submits that the out-of-hours calls seemed to coincide with days when the Appellant was at the shopping centre, thus increasing the likelihood that they would be for work-related purposes. This fact is compelling. Moreover, I do not accept, as suggested by the Appellant, that telephone calls of a work-related nature could not last for a couple of minutes.

104The Appellant's trial counsel also seemed to place significant weight on the nature and content of the relevant telephone contact. The Complainant was questioned for an extended period on the content of telephone calls made between herself and the Appellant. She denied making comments of an intimate and sexual nature to the Appellant on the telephone. The Complainant persistently maintained that conversations outside work hours were of a work-related nature. 

105It is noteworthy that, when questioned on the telephone calls in cross-examination, the Complainant was relying on her recollection of events that were at least 18 months' old. That the Complainant could not recall details of mobile telephone calls made over 18 months previously is not unreasonable. It is, in fact, entirely consistent with her account that the Appellant would sometimes call her looking for the bucket and the mop. Such calls would be unremarkable, and the details are not something the ordinary person would necessarily recall 18 months later. 

106Whilst the Appellant's telephone records show some out-of-hours contact between him and the Complainant, and whilst some of this contact was late in the evening on the nights of the offences, such timing does not necessarily support an inference that the nature of the contact was intimate and personal. The Complainant gave an explanation of this contact, being that it was work related, and nothing raised by the Appellant under this submission is sufficient to impugn the credibility of the Complainant's explanation. The jury must have taken this approach and I share this view.

107Accordingly, this submission ought be rejected. 

Submission 3

108It was submitted for the Appellant that the Complainant gave no plausible explanation for continuing to change in the cleaners' room after the first two assaults in circumstances where she knew the Appellant had a key to that room.

109The Complainant was asked in cross-examination why she continued to get changed in the cleaners' room (T57-58, 11 August 2010):

""Q. Weren't you worried about something happening if you kept getting changed in the cleaners' room after what happened that you say happened the first time, weren't you worried about being in the cleaners' room?
A. WITNESS: Yes I do, I worry.

Q. Isn't it the case that at Pender Place quite close to the cleaners' room, there are a number of toilets?
A. WITNESS: Yes.

...

Q. Wasn't there a lock so that when people are using the toilet they could lock the door and stop anybody else from coming in?
A. WITNESS: No because they get ... (not transcribable).. toilets. Inside the toilets yes you can lock it then.

...

Q. Because that would have - if somebody was coming in to your cleaners' room that had a key that would have prevented them from catching you while you were getting changed wouldn't it if you went to the - say you went to the disabled toilet they couldn't do that there?
A. WITNESS: Yes but I didn't think like that.

Q. But you didn't think like that. 
A. WITNESS: No.""

110The Complainant clearly accepted that there was an alternative location in which she could have changed, but did not think to change there.

111The Appellant entered the cleaners' room whilst the Complainant was getting changed on two occasions during the 17-day term of the Complainant's employment. There were days during that period when the Appellant was at the shopping centre while the Complainant was working and did not come into the cleaners' room. 

112It is pertinent to note that nothing in the evidence appears to indicate that the Complainant knew which days the Appellant would be at the shopping centre. In fact, she expected him to be away in Sydney for some days each week. This supports the Complainant's evidence that she did not think to get changed elsewhere. 

113In circumstances where the Appellant had only entered the cleaners' room twice, it was not unreasonable for the Complainant to continue changing in that location. The Complainant's decision to continue changing in the very facilities provided to her for that purpose ought not form the basis of an inference adverse to her credibility.

114This submission is rejected.

Submission 4

115The Appellant's fourth submission under Ground 1 was that the Complainant gave inconsistent versions of what occurred during the events that gave rise to Count 3.

116Dr Holland gave evidence in the Crown case. In respect of Count 3, he had recorded in his examination notes that the Complainant had indicated that both oral and vaginal intercourse took place on 7 February 2009 (T54, 12 August 2010). This was inconsistent with the Complainant's evidence at trial regarding Count 3, which asserted that only vaginal intercourse took place. In cross-examination, the Complainant stated that, if she did tell Dr Holland that oral intercourse occurred, it would have been because she was stressed and made a mistake (T72-74, 11 August 2010).

117The Crown does not suggest that the history was taken inaccurately. Nor is it suggested that the Complainant did not give the above account to Dr Holland. 

118It is noteworthy, firstly, that this was the only inconsistency in the Complainant's account upon which the Appellant seeks to rely. It can hardly be suggested that the Complainant regularly changed her version of events. Secondly, the Complainant has asserted all along that the Appellant attempted to make her perform fellatio on 7 February 2009. Thus, it is possible that she simply misspoke when giving her history to Dr Holland. Thirdly, Dr Holland gave unchallenged evidence that the Complainant's mobile telephone rang during the examination, and that the Complainant told him that it was the Appellant calling her. Dr Holland described the Complainant's demeanour at that point in time as slightly upset (T59-60, 12 August 2010). This supports the Complainant's evidence of being stressed, and serves to explain why her mind might have been elsewhere at the time.

119In my view, the Complainant's inconsistent account of what took place during Count 3 was a minor mistake in the context of the whole of her evidence at the trial. It does not indicate that she fabricated any part of her account and it does not, in my opinion, affect the reliability of the rest of her evidence. The jury would have taken the same view, fortified by the advantage which the jury had of observing the Complainant giving her testimony.

120I reject the fourth submission.

Submission 5

121The Appellant's final submission under Ground 1 concerns the sexual assault complaint made by the Complainant to Ms Reynolds, and its proximity to the Complainant's employment being terminated. It was central to the Appellant's case theory that the Complainant became increasingly dissatisfied at having not been paid for her work at the shopping centre, and that she fabricated the complaint after being told her services were no longer required.

122Firstly, it is necessary to address the issue regarding the arrangement pursuant to which the Complainant was to be paid. 

123The Appellant and the Complainant both gave evidence that there was a discussion concerning the Complainant's pay at their first meeting on 23 January 2009. The Complainant's evidence as to her understanding of the arrangement arising from this conversation was that she would be paid at the end of the first two weeks of her employment (T27-28, 11 August 2010). The Appellant's evidence as to his understanding was to a similar effect (T28, 16 August 2010).

124In fact, the Complainant was not paid by the Appellant at the end of her first two weeks. She was informed by the Appellant on 9 February 2009 (the day after she was due to receive her first payment under the arrangement) that it would be a further two weeks before she would be paid (T11, 11 August 2010).

125The Crown accepted on appeal that there was an ongoing issue between the Appellant and the Complainant about the Complainant's pay. Both parties gave evidence at trial that, despite the arrangement, a number of enquiries were made by the Complainant as to when and how she would be paid. 

126The Complainant recalled three such occasions. The first of these was some time before 1 February 2009 (T54-55, 11 August 2010). The second was on either 5 or 6 February 2009. On this occasion, the Complainant said that she went to the office of the Appellant and asked to receive her pay as her husband had requested that she put $100.00 worth of petrol in their car. She said that the Appellant became angry and yelled, ""You fucking bitch I won't pay you anything. Tell the fucking police, or anyone, they have crazy laws, I'm not scared of them, because I'm Iraqi"" (T30, 10 August 2010). The third occasion was on 9 February 2009 when she was informed she would have to wait a further fortnight to receive remuneration (T11, 11 August 2010).

127The Appellant asserted that there was a further occasion on which the Complainant enquired about her pay. This took place on 30 January 2009. The Complainant denied asking to be paid on this occasion (T52-53, 11 August 2010). The Appellant went on to say that, at the disco later that evening, he asked Ms Reynolds to confirm the pay arrangement with the Complainant in their native language (T31, 16 August 2010). Ms Reynolds corroborated this evidence (T36-37, 13 August 2010). The Complainant could not recall this discussion taking place (T53, 11 August 2010).

128The Complainant was questioned in cross-examination as to why she repeatedly asked about being paid (T55-56, 11 August 2010) (emphasis added):

""Q. So you told us in your evidence that you were - you knew that you weren't being paid for two weeks anyway, didn't you, right from the start?
A. WITNESS: Yeah, when --

...

Q. Yeah, but then it was only a few days later that you started to ask about getting paid? Before 1 February you started asking about it?
A. WITNESS: Yes, I ask him how he pay because I give him that my name, he wanted .. (not transcribable) .. that's the subject is.

Q. I'm sorry, I didn't understand that. Can you repeat it?
A. WITNESS: I ask him how he pay because he told me going to pay me under the table, so I want it clear to him how he pay me. So I - when I ask my husband, 'What's the meaning 'under the table'?' and my husband told me is cash in hand. So I told him - that's why we are talking outside and told him I don't like paying cash in hand, so I give me tax file number. My husband told me give it to him because it's - that's no good you work. That's why we conversation that.""

129The Appellant's submission with respect to this evidence is that it demonstrates dissatisfaction on the part of the Complainant with respect to her pay and, therefore, discloses a motive to fabricate a sexual assault complaint once she was no longer employed at the shopping centre. 

130I am not persuaded that the evidence supports this inference. I accept the Crown submission that the Complainant was confused as to the terms of her employment and the concept of ""under the table"". In fact, it appears the Complainant's husband advised her that this was not a good arrangement. This obviously caused her some stress. Moreover, the Complainant suffered a significant language barrier, which was helped little by the Appellant also speaking minimal English. It follows that it was not unreasonable, in my view, for the Complainant to make multiple enquiries with the Appellant about her pay.

131I turn now to the sexual assault complaint made by the Complainant to Ms Reynolds.

132The Appellant places significance on the fact that the Complainant confided in Ms Reynolds about the pay dispute first, and only mentioned the sexual assaults after she had been dismissed.

133On 9 February 2009, the Complainant spoke with Ms Reynolds over the telephone. Grievance was expressed by the Complainant with respect to not having been paid by the Appellant following their conversation earlier that day, and an indication was given that she wanted to leave the employment. It appears also that the Complainant indicated to Ms Reynolds that there was something else she wanted to tell her, but that she could not do it over the telephone as she was concerned her husband might overhear (T12, 11 August 2010). This evidence was corroborated by Ms Reynolds (T26-27, 13 August 2010).

134The Complainant was dismissed on 10 February 2009. Almost immediately afterward, the Complainant reported the assaults to Ms Reynolds. Later that same afternoon, she reported the assaults to the police.

135It is true there was a delay between the occurrence of the assaults and the making of the complaint. Nine days, in fact, passed from the date of the first assaults to the complaint on 10 February 2009. It is also true that the Complainant was not without persons in whom she could have confided, nor opportunities to do so. The evidence suggested that Ms Reynolds asked the Complainant if anything had happened between her and the Appellant one or two days after Count 3 (T12, 11 August 2010; T26-27, 13 August 2010). 

136However, upon analysis, I do not think that the delay in this case assists the Appellant in any material respect. To infer that the Complainant fabricated the sexual assault complaint from her reluctance to mention the assaults earlier than she did, or her decision to complain about her pay situation first, ignores the fact that the Complainant likely felt vulnerable and powerless at work as a result of multiple sexual assaults at the hands of her employer. This was no doubt matched by a fear of what might happen at work if she complained. She was apparently eager to be paid and probably thought that any chance that the Appellant would eventually pay her might disappear if she told someone he had raped her. 

137A number of further observations ought be made in this respect. 

138Firstly, the evidence indicates that the Complainant called Ms Reynolds during the evening of 1 February 2009, following Counts 1 and 2. The Complainant said that Ms Reynolds was unable to talk (T25, 10 August 2010). It is possible that the Complainant intended to report the first two assaults at that time but was unable to do so. 

139Secondly, the Complainant expressed reasons why she did not mention the assaults to her husband, being that she was concerned that he might retaliate towards the Appellant on her behalf (T25, 10 August 2010; T26, 11 August 2010). It follows that it is understandable that the Complainant would be worried about mentioning the assaults to Ms Reynolds over the telephone within earshot of her husband. 

140Thirdly, the Appellant's assertion that the Complainant had a motive to fabricate the assaults upon being fired ignores the Complainant's evidence that, by the time the Appellant dismissed her on 10 February 2009, she had already decided that she wanted to resign from her position at the shopping centre. This decision was reached, it seems, after her discussion with the Appellant about her pay on 9 February 2009, and his ongoing refusal to pay her (T69, 11 August 2010; T37, 12 August 2010). The fact that she already wanted to leave the shopping centre by the time she was dismissed renders less likely any suggestion that her dismissal provided any necessary catalyst to fabricate the complaint.

141The law recognises that there may be good reason for a person delaying making a complaint of sexual assault: s.294 Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The jury was so instructed in this case. No legal rule imposes a time limit on the making of a complaint in respect of a sexual assault allegation: R v Manton [2005] NSWCCA 58 at [3]. The delay in this case was comparatively short. 

142In my view, it was not unreasonable, in the circumstances, for the Complainant to delay in reporting the sexual assaults until after her dismissal. Once again, I infer that the jury took a similar approach, correctly in my opinion.

143Accordingly, the fifth submission is rejected.

Conclusion on Ground 1

144I have undertaken an independent assessment of the entirety of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality. 

145The jury had the significant advantage of seeing and hearing the Complainant and the Appellant give evidence. No challenge is made to any directions given to the jury. I have kept in mind that each of the Complainant, Ms Reynolds and the Appellant gave evidence (to varying extents) through interpreters. The courts have recognised that the fact that where key witnesses give evidence through an interpreter, it may limit the ability of a tribunal of fact to assess demeanour as an aid to fact finding: Goodrich Aerospace Pty Ltd v Arsic [2006] NSWCA 187; 66 NSWLR 186 at 190 [21]-[22]. However, the jury observed the witnesses, and in particular the Appellant and the Complainant, giving evidence on matters where sexual conduct was the topic, with an associated question of consent. Even where witnesses are giving evidence through interpreters, a jury will be in a position to make assessments concerning the witnesses and their reactions to questions put to them on topics such as this. The jury had this advantage in this trial. 

146The convictions of the Appellant depended heavily on the testimony of the Complainant. The Complainant's evidence did not match perfectly with the other witnesses. It would be surprising if it did. 

147The Appellant's submissions under this ground raise questions about the credibility of the Complainant's evidence. I have considered those submissions individually and have concluded that they lack merit. I have considered them cumulatively as well, in case their combined effect may lead to a different conclusion. Having done so, I do not consider that the combined effect of these submissions serves to undermine the credibility of the Complainant. 

148The totality of the material before this Court does not disclose discrepancies or display inadequacies of the kind referred to in the majority judgment in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 (at 494-495), such as to lead this Court to conclude that there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted.

149In M v The Queen, McHugh J made the following observations (at 534):

""It is the everyday experience of the courts that honest witnesses are frequently in error about the details of events. The more accounts that they are asked to give the greater is the chance that there will be discrepancies about details and even inconsistencies in the various accounts. Of course, it is legitimate to test the honesty or accuracy of a witness's evidence by analysing the discrepancies and inconsistencies in his or her accounts of an incident. In a case where accuracy of recollection is vital - such as the account of a conversation in a fraud case or the description of a person where identity is the issue - discrepancies and inconsistencies in the witness's account may make it impossible to accept that person's evidence, no matter how honest he or she appears to be. But in other cases, discrepancies and inconsistencies may be of far less importance if the honesty of the witness, as opposed to the accuracy of the detail, is the crucial issue. If a jury thinks that the demeanour of the witness or the probability of occurrence of the witness's general account is persuasive, they may reasonably think that discrepancies or even inconsistencies concerning details are of little moment.""


150These observations have particular application to this case. 

151Two short observations ought be made about the Complainant's evidence and the manner in which it was given (insofar as that may be gleaned from a reading of the record of the trial). 

152Firstly, throughout all of her evidence, the Complainant rarely faltered as to her version of events. She maintained a reasonably clear narrative, even under cross-examination. 

153Secondly, it ought be noted that the Complainant impressed as a woman who was extremely loyal to her husband. The evidence indicates that she asked his permission before accepting the job at the shopping centre and before attending the disco on 30 January 2009. It was also common for the Complainant to be driven to work by her husband, and she introduced him to the Appellant on her first day of work (see T26, 11 August 2010; T51, 16 August 2010). All of this renders more fanciful the suggestion that she would, almost immediately after commencing her employment, have declared her sexual interest in the Appellant and embarked upon a course of consensual sexual acts with him. 

154The jury had the opportunity to see and hear the Appellant give evidence. In convicting the Appellant on all counts, the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Complainant was a truthful and reliable witness, and duly rejected the fanciful account of the Appellant. 

155The evidence was such that it was open to the jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant was guilty. I am satisfied to the criminal standard that the Appellant was guilty of the offences of which he was convicted. It has not been demonstrated that the verdicts were unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. 

156I reject the first ground of appeal.

157If the Appellant had succeeded on the first ground of appeal, he would have been entitled to be acquitted by this Court. He has not succeeded on that ground.

158I turn to the second ground of appeal whereby the Appellant seeks a new trial upon several bases. 

Ground 2: The Trial Miscarried

159The Appellant contends that the trial miscarried upon a number of bases, identified in the ground of appeal.

160At some time after the conclusion of the trial, process was issued by the Appellant to obtain the Complainant's mobile telephone records. As mentioned, these records were not adduced at the trial. 

161The Complainant's telephone records were admitted as Exhibit A on the appeal.

162An affidavit of the Appellant's trial counsel, Garry Sundstrom, affirmed 27 June 2012, was read by Mr Strickland SC. Mr Sundstrom was cross-examined by the Crown. 

163In short, it was Mr Sundstrom's evidence that he had been advised by the Appellant that it was not possible to obtain the records. Counsel accepted these instructions and no steps were undertaken to obtain such records.

164The Appellant contends that the trial miscarried due to the absence of the Complainant's telephone records from evidence adduced at the trial. 

165The Appellant submits that the failure of the Appellant's trial counsel to obtain and tender the records caused a series of irregularities in the conduct of the trial, namely:

(a) the Appellant's legal representatives were unable to cross-examine the Complainant on her telephone records;

(b) the Crown's cross-examination of the Appellant on his telephone records was unfairly prejudicial, being based upon premises which, had the Complainant's telephone records been available, would have been shown to be inaccurate.

166The Appellant seeks to have his conviction on each count set aside on the grounds that these irregularities amounted to a miscarriage of justice.

Relevant Legal Principles Concerning Fresh and New Evidence

167The Appellant submits that there was a miscarriage of justice so that the convictions ought be quashed under s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

168The Appellant seeks that this Court have regard to the Complainant's telephone records, and consider what effect they might have had on the result of the trial had they been obtained and tendered at that time. 

169Mr Strickland SC made clear that this ground of appeal did not contend that the Appellant's trial counsel had been incompetent. No reliance was placed upon the principles in R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 at 685.

170Mr Strickland SC accepted that this ground of appeal called for the application of principles surrounding suggested fresh or new evidence.

171Counsel agreed that this Court should approach the matter by application of the principles in R v Abou-Chabake [2004] NSWCCA 356; 149 A Crim R 417, where Kirby J referred to the following seven principles (at 427-428 [63]):

""First, a distinction is made between 'new evidence' and 'fresh evidence'. Fresh evidence is evidence not available to the accused at the time of the trial, actually or constructively. Evidence is constructively available if it could have been discovered, or available at the trial by the exercise of due diligence.

Second, great latitude must be extended to an accused in determining what evidence by reasonable diligence, could have been available at his trial (Ratten v The Queen (supra) per Barwick CJ at 512).

Third, the Court is ultimately concerned with whether there has been a miscarriage of justice. The rationale for setting aside a conviction on the basis of new evidence or fresh evidence is that the absence of that evidence from the trial was, in effect, a miscarriage of justice. That evidence must be examined in the context of the evidence given at the trial (Mickelberg v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 259, per Toohey and Gaudron JJ at 301).

Fourth, the issue of whether there has been a miscarriage is to be approached on a number of levels, depending upon the order sought (whether a verdict of acquittal or a new trial), and the capacity of the new or fresh evidence to sustain the order sought.

Fifth, where a verdict of acquittal is sought and the new evidence is of such cogency that innocence is shown to the Court's satisfaction, or the Court entertains a reasonable doubt as to guilt, the guilty verdict will be quashed and the appellant discharged. In such circumstances, it does not matter whether the evidence is fresh or simply new (Ratten v The Queen (supra) Barwick CJ at 518/519; cf Gibbs CJ in Gallagher v The Queen (1986) 160 CLR 392 at 398/399).

Sixth, where the evidence does not have that quality, or where a new trial is sought, a number of issues arise. The verdict will be quashed and a new trial ordered only where the following questions are answered affirmatively:

Is the evidence fresh?
If it is, is it 'credible' or at least capable of belief (Gallagher v The Queen (supra) per Gibbs CJ at 395), or 'plausible' (Mickelberg v The Queen (supra) per Toohey and Gaudron JJ at 301)?
If it is, would that evidence, in the context of the evidence given at the trial, have been likely to have caused the jury to have entertained a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused (Gallagher v The Queen (supra) per Brennan J at 410) or, if there is a practical difference, is there a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the accused (Gallagher v The Queen (supra) per Mason and Deane JJ at 402)? See Mickelberg v The Queen (supra) per Toohey & Gaudron JJ 301-302.
Seventh, the concept of a miscarriage of justice is not an abstract investigation of truth (cf an Inquiry under s474D Crimes Act 1900). It is an investigation in the context of the adversarial nature of the criminal trial. Where deliberate tactical decisions are made on the part of the accused as to the evidence that should or should not be called, and the issues that should or should not be pursued, there is nothing unfair, and there will be no miscarriage, in holding an accused to such decisions, even though it is conceivable that other decisions or something else may have worked rather better (Ratten v The Queen (supra) at 517).""

172The onus is on the Appellant to show that the absence of the new evidence at the trial resulted in a miscarriage of justice: TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124 at 143 [63].

173As mentioned earlier (at [169]), Mr Strickland SC did not seek to invoke the principles in R v Birks. However, this ground does involve some assessment of what the Appellant's legal representatives did before and at the trial, concerning the Complainant's telephone records. For this reason, the principles concerning fresh and new evidence are to be applied in determining this ground. It must be kept in mind that a criminal trial is adversarial in nature and that, as a general rule, an accused person is bound by the conduct of the trial by counsel.

174In TKWJ v The Queen, Hayne J (Gummow J agreeing) said at 158 [106] (footnotes omitted):

""Account must be taken of the nature of a criminal trial. A criminal trial is not an examination of all the material that exists and bears on the question of an accused's guilt. It is an accusatory and adversarial process in which the prosecution and the defence are responsible for deciding the ground on which the trial will be fought and the evidence that each will lead. That is why the rules about fresh evidence on appeal have developed as they have. And the decisions that are made by the parties about how the trial is to be fought are decisions made on material that may in some respects be incomplete and in other respects turn on questions of professional judgment about which reasonable minds may differ.""

175It is not to the point for an accused person to show that, in certain respects, the trial might have been conducted differently: Ali v The Queen [2005] HCA 8; 79 ALJR 662 at 665 [12]. It is necessary for the Appellant to demonstrate that a miscarriage of justice has occurred. 

Did The Failure To Adduce the Complainant's Phone Records Cause A Miscarriage Of Justice?

176The Appellant concedes on this appeal that the Complainant's telephone records constitute ""new evidence"" and not ""fresh evidence"", in the sense explained in R v Abou-Chabake. This concession is made on the basis that the records were constructively available to the Appellant's legal representatives at the trial, insofar as they could have been obtained through the exercise of reasonable diligence ([69] Appellant's written submissions; T15-16, 3 August 2012). 

177The Appellant's trial counsel, Mr Sundstrom, gave evidence that the Appellant informed him that it was not possible to obtain the Complainant's telephone records; the Appellant having been advised of this himself by the relevant telephone company. As a result, no attempt was made to subpoena them prior to trial.

178The Appellant concedes that the records were constructively available at trial, and it is appropriate that these records be characterised as ""new evidence"", as opposed to ""fresh evidence"".

179I mention, in passing, an argument advanced on behalf of the Appellant, in respect of the Complainant's telephone records, in written submissions. After conceding that the telephone records constituted ""new"" and not ""fresh"" evidence, the Appellant then sought to invoke the concept of ""great latitude"" that is to be extended to accused persons in determining what evidence could have been adduced with reasonable diligence. 

180With respect, that is not the correct approach to be taken in accordance with the principles emerging from the authorities summarised in R v Abou-Chabake. ""Great latitude"" is to be extended to an accused person in determining whether evidence, by reasonable diligence, could have been available at trial. Here, Mr Strickland SC concedes that the Complainant's telephone records could have been available at trial with the exercise of reasonable diligence. This concession is understandable. The Appellant's legal representatives at trial acted upon their client's instructions that the Complainant's telephone records could not be obtained. No further or independent enquiry was made in this regard. This is a clear situation where the Appellant cannot satisfy the fresh evidence test. The concept of ""great latitude"" has no role to play in these circumstances. 

181The Appellant must satisfy the new evidence test. New evidence, as opposed to fresh evidence, will only support a determination that a miscarriage of justice has occurred in a very narrow set of circumstances. The evidence must be so cogent as to satisfy the Court as to the Appellant's innocence, or invoke a reasonable doubt as to the Appellant's guilt. In such circumstances it will not matter that the evidence is merely ""new"" and not ""fresh"": R v Abou-Chabake per Kirby J at 427-428 [63]; affirming Ratten v The Queen [1974] HCA 35; 131 CLR 510 per Barwick CJ at 518-519.

182This is a strict test. It requires more than would be required if the evidence had not been available (constructively or otherwise) to the Appellant at his trial. 

183The new evidence, the Complainant's telephone records, must be considered in the context of the whole of the evidence which was before the jury at the trial: R v Abou-Chabake per Kirby J at 427-428 [63]; affirming Mickelberg v The Queen [1989] HCA 35; 167 CLR 259 per Toohey and Gaudron JJ at 301. An assessment must be made as to whether the absence of this evidence from the jury's consideration at the trial amounted to a miscarriage of justice such that the verdict on each count ought be set aside.

The Complainant's Telephone Records

184The Complainant's telephone records, admitted on appeal (Exhibit A), relate to the period between 23 January and 9 February 2009 inclusive. 

185Unlike the Appellant's telephone records, the Complainant's records show both outgoing and incoming calls, as well as outgoing and incoming text messages. 

186Some of the entries in the records correspond with entries in the Appellant's telephone records, as would be expected. In particular and of significance to this appeal, the calls made during the evenings of 1 February and 7 February 2009 are present also in the Complainant's records. Like the Appellant's records, the Complainant's records include calls and text messages made outside work hours.

187The Complainant's telephone records also reveal information pertaining to the geographical location of both the caller and the receiver at the time of each call.

188Submissions to this Court proceeded upon the basis that the Complainant's telephone records were reliable evidence.

189I turn to consider the submissions advanced for the Appellant in respect of the claimed irregularities that flowed from the failure of the Appellant's legal representatives at trial to adduce the Complainant's telephone records. 

Cross-Examination of the Complainant on the Telephone Records

190It was submitted for the Appellant that the absence of the Complainant's telephone records at the trial deprived his trial counsel of the opportunity to cross-examine her as to why she made various telephone calls, and as to the content of the conversations had therein. It was contended that this amounted to a miscarriage of justice. 

191Whilst this submission was directed to the telephone contact between the Appellant and the Complainant generally, a substantial part of the written submission was directed to a series of calls made by the Complainant during the afternoon of 30 January 2009. These calls followed the meeting that took place in the Appellant's office at the shopping centre. Five of these calls lasted for longer than 30 seconds, the longest lasting for almost two minutes. The calls all occurred between 2.30 pm and 8.30 pm.

192As mentioned earlier in this judgment (at [35]), evidence of an additional incident that occurred during the meeting between the Appellant and the Complainant in the Appellant's office on 30 January 2009 was not before the jury. The Appellant's trial counsel had objected to the following paragraph of the Complainant's statement to police wherein she outlined this incident as follows (at [12]):

""... After a while I had to go back to work, he took hold of my hand and said, 'Hang on just wait' I said, 'What for?' he said, 'Come here can you suck my Cock?' I was in shock, at first I thought he was joking, I said, 'What I don't do that to my husband, why would I do that to you.' He had taken his penis out and said, 'Come here and feel it' I said, 'No, no put it away.' I said, 'I respect to you, you respect to me. I am not that easy. I have husband and kids and you have the same as me I don't want to put shit on top of my husband head. Just be friends that's all.' He said, 'Okay you go' ...""


193This evidence was excluded by the trial Judge upon the basis that its prejudicial effect outweighed any probative value.

194On appeal, the Appellant asserts that, had the Complainant's telephone records been available, the Appellant's trial counsel would not have objected to paragraph 12 of the Complainant's statement to police. This view was expressed upon the basis of the telephone calls and text messages from the Complainant to the Appellant later in the afternoon of 30 January 2009. It was the Appellant's submission that the records of these calls would have opened up a material line of questioning concerning the nature of the relationship between the Appellant and the Complainant.

195The Appellant submits that it was inconsistent with the Complainant's account of the nature of the relationship for her to contact the Appellant following his supposedly unwanted sexual advances in his office, and for her to attend the disco with him later that evening. The Appellant also seeks to impugn the Complainant's credibility on the basis that she lied about the amount of contact between the two of them on 30 January 2009.

196The Appellant also asks this Court to draw the broader inference that the additional telephone calls recorded in Exhibit A, made throughout the entire term of the Complainant's employment, further illustrate the existence of an intimate and sexual relationship to an extent that was not before the jury at trial. This submission was based on the quantum of telephone contact, and the proximity of certain contact to significant events in the factual substratum of this case.

197The Crown asserts that additional lines of questioning would not have assisted the Appellant at trial. It was submitted that the Complainant had already been cross-examined as to the nature of her telephone communication with the Appellant. She had given evidence that the conversations between her and the Appellant were work related and not personal. She also could not recall there having been any personal discussions between them. It was contended by the Crown that confronting the Complainant with evidence of further telephone contact would not materially alter this position.

198The Crown also pointed to the limited amount of face-to-face contact between the Appellant and the Complainant, as indicating a lack of opportunity to develop a relationship of the kind suggested by the Appellant. There is considerable force in this submission. Given the number of days the Appellant spent in Sydney during the initial week of the Complainant's employment, there was little time for the Appellant and the Complainant to spend together (either at work or socially). 

199 In asking this Court to take into account the calls made by the Complainant to the Appellant on 30 January 2009 in the context of the additional incident that occurred in the Appellant's office, the Appellant must accept all inferences that may be drawn from this evidence, including those adverse to his case.

200The Crown points to two such inferences which cause some difficulty to the Appellant. The first of these is the comment in paragraph 12 of the Complainant's statement to police that she does not perform fellatio on her husband. The Crown submits that this reduces the likelihood that she would engage in such behaviour with the Appellant. The second is the Complainant's rejection of the Appellant's advances on that occasion. This, according to the Crown, supports an inference that the Complainant was not romantically interested in the Appellant. It is also supportive of the Complainant's testimony that she rejected his advances on other occasions (including on the days of the assaults).

201There is considerable force in these submissions, which I accept. 

202I observe, as well, that Exhibit A in fact contains evidence that contradicts various assertions made by the Appellant at trial. In particular, the locations of each party as recorded in Exhibit A are, at times, inconsistent with the Appellant's evidence as to his location. The Crown submits that, had this evidence been before the jury, it may in fact have proved damaging to the Appellant's credit. This is a persuasive submission.

203To my mind, there is nothing that operates adversely to the Crown in the calls made by the Complainant to the Appellant on 30 January 2009. It is a fact that they attended the disco on that evening. It must be borne in mind that the records indicate the number and duration of calls only, and not the content of any calls. 

204Whilst the Complainant chose to attend the disco on the Friday after the Appellant had made advances towards her, the Crown points to the fact that the plans to attend the disco were arranged by the Appellant and Ms Reynolds, not the Complainant. Further, the Complainant was initially reluctant to attend the disco, and only changed her mind after receiving multiple telephone calls. 

205The new evidence does not support the inferences sought by the Appellant. Taken at their highest, the Complainant's telephone records merely increase the quantum of communication between the Appellant and the Complainant. They do not reveal the content of any communication. 

206Furthermore, and importantly, the number of calls recorded in Exhibit A is not significantly greater than the number of calls that were before the jury in Exhibits D and E at the trial. The Crown submitted that, of the 40 calls in Exhibit A that lasted for longer than 10 seconds, only 11 were not in evidence at the trial. It is difficult, therefore, to ascertain what benefit would be derived from the additional calls. Clearly, there was a dispute as to what was said during each of the telephone conversations, but this dispute cannot be resolved by the telephone records alone.

207It has not been demonstrated that the absence of the Complainant's telephone records had any material effect on the trial. The evidence falls far short of demonstrating that a miscarriage of justice occurred. 

208It follows that, if there was a benefit lost by not having the Complainant's telephone records in evidence at the trial (and I do not believe there was), it was not such as to result in a miscarriage of justice.

209I reject the Appellant's submission that a miscarriage of justice resulted from the absence of the Complainant's telephone records at trial.

The Crown's Cross-Examination of the Appellant

210It was submitted for the Appellant that the Crown's cross-examination of him at trial was unfairly prejudicial. It was contended that, had the Complainant's telephone records been before the jury, the questions posed to him would have been inaccurately premised.

211Much of the Crown's cross-examination focused on certain telephone calls that the Appellant asserted were made to him by the Complainant in proximity to significant events. Insofar as the cross-examination suggested that the Appellant was lying or mistaken about these calls, it was submitted that his credibility was unfairly tarnished. 

212It was the Appellant's case at trial that the Complainant had expressed romantic interest in him during the first week of her employment at the shopping centre. The Crown challenged this aspect of the Appellant's case during cross-examination on the basis that the available telephone records did not disclose after-hours calls. I accept that the Complainant's telephone records do, in fact, show some contact at the relevant times; namely, a call on 25 January 2009, a text message on 28 January 2009, multiple calls on 30 January 2009, and two text messages on 31 January 2009. These records may have assisted the Appellant concerning the number of calls. However, they could not assist him on the content of any of those calls. 

213The Appellant also took issue with the Crown's cross-examination of him in respect of other calls that he asserted were made to him by the Complainant but which were not evident in Exhibits D and E. It was submitted on the Appellant's behalf that, had the Complainant's telephone records been before the jury, much of this cross-examination would have been blunted. 

214The difficulty facing the Appellant on this issue is that the Complainant's records do not, in my view, support the assertions he is making. The call that the Appellant says was made to him by the Complainant one or two days after 1 February 2009, seeking another ""physical get together"", is not recorded in Exhibit A. 

215Further, Exhibit A completely contradicts what the Appellant says happened on the evening of 7 February 2009. The Appellant said he received a missed call from the Complainant. According to Exhibit A, the Complainant did not call the Appellant that evening. The Appellant also says that he had two conversations with the Complainant that night. Exhibit A reveals only one call of a sufficient length to constitute a conversation.

216If the Complainant's telephone records had been available at trial, they might have provided some modest assistance to the Appellant, but they would have also undermined his evidence in other respects.

217The Appellant says that the absence of the Complainant's telephone records caused a series of irregularities in the trial. However, the records added little by way of probative material that could be of assistance to the Appellant's case. In fact, in some aspects, the records are damaging to the Appellant.

218The Appellant has not demonstrated that a miscarriage of justice occurred as contended for in this submission.

A Further Aspect of Ground 2 Complaining of the Crown's Closing Address

219Included in Ground 2 is a free-standing complaint about the content of the Crown closing address.

220During the Crown trial advocate's closing address to the jury, reference was made to the significant factual dispute between the Appellant and the Complainant regarding the nature of their relationship. The Appellant submits that the remarks were highly prejudicial.

221The relevant portion of the Crown's closing address is as follows (emphasis added):

""The Crown says that there's been a lot of evidence led before you or sought to be led before you that has very little weight that amounts to a scurrilous attack upon the complainant's credibility and character. The Crown says what you have to accept as a foundation for it is that the complainant declared to [Ms Reynolds], before the day that they went to the disco, that she was romantically interested in the accused. The Complainant denied that and [Ms Reynolds] also did too. It's just the accused that asserts it.""

222Two aspects of the above passage fall for consideration by this Court:

(a) the Crown trial advocate's description of the evidence of the Appellant regarding the nature of his relationship with the Complainant as a ""scurrilous attack"" upon the Complainant's character and credit; and

(b) the Crown trial advocate's submission to the jury that the Appellant's evidence on the matter had ""very little weight"".

223The Crown submits that no complaint was made by the Appellant's experienced trial counsel concerning this comment, and that this indicates the lack of impact of the words at trial.

224Comments of Crown Prosecutors during their closing address have been the subject of judicial consideration on numerous occasions: see McCullough v The Queen [1982] Tas R 43; 6 A Crim R 274; R v Kennedy [2000] NSWCCA 487; 118 A Crim R34; R v Rugari [2001] NSWCCA 64; 122 A Crim R 1; R v Liristis [2004] NSWCCA 287; 146 A Crim R 547; R v Attallah [2005] NSWCCA 277; Livermore v R [2006] NSWCCA 334; 67 NSWLR 659; KNP v R [2006] NSWCCA 213; 67 NSWLR 227; Soames v R [2012] NSWCCA 188.

225The Court in Livermore v R reviewed the relevant authorities and stated (at 667 [31]) that there are five features of a Crown address that have consistently been held to justify the intervention of this Court:

""(i) A submission to the jury based upon material which is not in evidence.

(ii) Intemperate or inflammatory comments, tending to arouse prejudice or emotion in the jury.

(iii) Comments which belittle or ridicule any part of an accused's case.

(iv) Impugning the credit of a Crown witness, where the witness was not afforded the opportunity of responding to an attack upon credit.

(v) Conveying to the jury the Crown Prosecutor's personal opinions.""


226It is submitted for the Appellant that the trial had been conducted upon the basis of a strong challenge to the credibility and reliability of the Complainant. The Appellant had given evidence, which was in conflict with that of the Complainant in critical respects. It was submitted that an emotive and excessive submission had been made by the Crown that a ""scurrilous attack"" had been made upon the Complainant's ""credibility and character"". It was submitted that the challenge to the evidence of the Complainant was forensically legitimate, and that the Crown submission was unfair and should not have been made. It was submitted that it had a tendency to deflect the jury so as to give rise to a miscarriage of justice.

227Submissions are sometimes made by the Crown, during closing address, to pre-empt submissions expected to come in the closing address of the defence: see R v Attallah at [109]; Livermore v R at [40]. 

228What the Crown trial advocate did in the present case may be described as a form of pre-emptive attack on what was anticipated by the Crown to be a key aspect of the Appellant's closing address. It ought be noted in this regard that much of the cross-examination of the Complainant was devoted to the nature of her relationship with the Appellant and the assertion that she had expressed romantic interest in him. 

229It was submitted on behalf of the Appellant before this Court that the evidence given by him concerning the nature of his relationship with the Complainant, and the cross-examination of the Complainant on that topic, did not amount to an attack on the Complainant's character. Instead, it was submitted, it constituted legitimate cross-examination of the Complainant based on instructions. The Appellant submitted that the Crown's comment to the jury suggested that his trial counsel had done something improper in adducing this evidence. 

230The Appellant's trial counsel was entitled to test the evidence of the Complainant, especially with respect to the nature of her relationship with the Appellant. Counsel was required to put his instructions to her, that she had romantic feelings for the Appellant.

231The word ""scurrilous"" is defined by the Macquarie Dictionary as meaning ""grossly or indecently abusive"". During the course of oral submissions in this Court, the Crown did not seek to defend the use of that term. Instead, it was submitted that the term was perhaps used by the Crown trial advocate in a more colloquial sense.

232It was submitted by the Crown that the remarks by the Crown trial advocate were a legitimate, albeit strongly worded, criticism of the evidence of the Appellant.

233In my view, the Crown trial advocate should not have used the words under challenge. It was inflammatory to assert that a ""scurrilous attack"" had occurred. 

234However, to the extent that the Appellant submits that these words constituted a strong (adverse) comment directed to the Appellant's trial counsel (and thus the Appellant), it is noteworthy that trial counsel made no complaint about them, and did not seek a correction or withdrawal from the trial Judge.

235The absence of complaint from the trial counsel indicates that no prejudice to the Appellant was perceived in the atmosphere of the trial.

236Further, it should be kept in mind that Ms Reynolds supported the Complainant, and not the Appellant, on the issue of whether the Complainant had expressed any romantic interest in the Appellant. This was an important aspect of the trial, and the Crown was entitled to remind the jury of this, using appropriate forceful language. However, the language selected was inappropriate and should not have been used. 

237That said, it has not been demonstrated that the Crown trial advocate's closing address gave rise to a miscarriage of justice. 

Orders


238The Appellant has not succeeded in his challenge to his convictions by the jury at trial. 

239The appeal against conviction should be dismissed.

240BUTTON J: I agree with Johnson J.

Grounds of Appeal

5The Applicant's Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal filed on 29 September 2011 notified certain grounds of appeal, which were amended on 14 March 2012. The amended grounds of appeal are as follows:

(a) Ground 1 - The Applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance arising from a lack of parity and/or due proportionality between the sentences imposed on him and the sentences imposed on his co-offenders.

(b) Ground 2 - The Judge erred in the approach taken to determining the sentences for the offences to which standard non-parole periods applied.

(c) Ground 3 - The sentence imposed for the offence of robbery in company with the infliction of grievous bodily harm (Count 3) is unreasonable or plainly unjust.

(d) Ground 4 - The aggregate sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust.

Facts of Offences

6The following recital of the offences is drawn from Statements of Facts which were tendered at the sentencing hearing.

Count 1 - Break Enter and Steal on 19 February 2008

7At about 11.20 pm on Tuesday 19 February 2008, police received a radio message that an alarm was sounding at the ""Willmot Friendly Grocer"", a supermarket and liquor store situated at Willmot.

8The police arrived at 11.28 pm to find the eaves of the store smashed and a case of Jim Beam bourbon whisky on the ground underneath the eaves. Two of the bottles from the case were smashed, and the other 10 bottles were missing.

9The police spoke with witnesses who gave a description of a male offender. 

10The owner of the store, Arvind Sahota, and the owner of the Willmot Shopping Centre, Eduard Affolter, viewed the CCTV footage of the break-in and identified the Applicant, whom they knew from previous contact. 

11Three cases of Woodstock bourbon whisky and cola in 375 ml cans and a case of Jim Beam bourbon whisky (700 ml bottles) were stolen in this offence.

Count 2 - Robbery on 20 May 2008 and Common Assault (Form 1)

12At about 7.30 pm on Tuesday 20 May 2008, the Applicant again entered the premises of the ""Willmot Friendly Grocer"". 

13The Applicant looked around for a few seconds, before reaching out to his right and grabbing hold of a newspaper stand, which divided the employee side of the counter from the public. 

14At this time, Susan Lawlis, an employee of the store, was standing at the cash register next to the newspaper stand. As the Applicant grabbed the newspaper stand, Ms Lawlis took hold of the other side of the stand to stop the Applicant gaining entry to the service side of the counter.

15A short struggle then took place between the Applicant and Ms Lawlis, before the Applicant overpowered her by pushing the stand back and using his left hand to push Ms Lawlis out of the way, thereby gaining entry to the service area. 

16Ms Lawlis called out to the shop owner, Arvind Sahota, for assistance.

17In fear of being assaulted further, Ms Lawlis ran to the phone to call the police. The Applicant then grabbed numerous packets of cigarettes and bottles of alcohol from the cigarette stand.

18Meanwhile, Mr Sahota raced to the counter area in an attempt to get the Applicant to leave. The Applicant continually yelled ""Fuck off or I will hit you over the head"". Mr Sahota had a baseball bat in his hands to protect himself and his property. The Applicant used a bottle of alcohol, which he held by the neck of the bottle, to threaten Mr Sahota.

19The Applicant ran out of the store with his pockets and arms full of cigarettes and alcohol. As he decamped, he dropped one 700 ml bottle of Black Douglas Scotch whisky.

20Soon after, the Applicant again approached the store. Mr Sahota was forced to close the metal roller door to prevent the Applicant from entering the store and taking more items.

21At midday on 26 June 2008, the Applicant was arrested and conveyed to Mt Druitt Police Station. The Applicant was interviewed by investigating police. He denied any involvement in the break and enter offence on 19 February 2008. The Applicant denied any involvement in the robbery on 20 May 2008. He admitted that he knew Mr Sahota, and that he had previously been banned from the store by Mr Sahota for stealing items, and for loitering near the store drinking alcohol and causing damage.

Form 1 Offences - Common Assault and Larceny on 12 March 2008

22The material before the District Court did not provide details of these matters which were taken into account on a Form 1 on sentence for Count 2.

23On 8 April 2008, the Applicant was arrested and charged in relation to the offences of common assault and larceny committed on 12 March 2008. He was granted bail and remained on bail until his arrest on 26 June 2008 with respect to Counts 1 and 2. 

Counts 3, 4, 5 and 6 - Offences Committed on 21 May 2008

24At about 11.30 pm on Wednesday, 21 May 2008, the four victims, Raymond Wilkinson, William Wilkinson, Jai Field and Simon Perry, left the St Marys Leagues Club after watching the State of Origin Rugby League match. The four victims walked across Forrester Road, North St Marys towards the Quix Service Station located on the corner of Forrester Road and Christie Street, North St Marys.

25As they arrived at the Quix Service Station, a white Holden Premier driven by Donna Swain, pulled into the service station, and parked next to a petrol pump on the southern side. The Applicant and a co-offender, Jeffrey Chesher, got out of the vehicle and walked towards the store. As they approached the store, other co-offenders, John Ika, OI and JW also left the vehicle and approached the store. 

26The Applicant and Mr Chesher entered the store and purchased some food. They left the store and walked back towards the vehicle with the other co-offenders.

27As they approached the vehicle, one of the offenders said to Mr Field and William Wilkinson, ""Where are you boys from?"" William Wilkinson replied, ""Whalan"". Mr Field said, ""What are you boys up to tonight?"" One of the offenders said, ""Just out killing cunts"". Mr Field then said, ""How's that going for you?"" The offenders did not reply. Mr Field then said, ""See you later boys. Have a good night"". One of the offenders replied, ""See you later"". 

28The offenders walked back towards Ms Swain's vehicle. Mr Field and William Wilkinson walked towards the corner of Forrester Road and Christie Street, where the other two victims were waiting for a taxi.

29The offenders got back into Ms Swain's vehicle and she drove out of the Forrester Road exit of the Quix Service Station and turned left. Ms Swain drove in a northerly direction towards the four victims. As she drove past the victims, John Ika yelled from the vehicle, ""Queenslanders!"" Mr Perry yelled, ""Go the Blues!"".

30Ms Swain drove slowly through the roundabout at the intersection of Forrester Road and Christie Street. As she went through the roundabout, John Ika yelled at her to stop the vehicle. All five offenders left the vehicle and ran towards the four victims.

31The five offenders punched and kicked the victims repeatedly about the head and body region, causing them all to be knocked to the ground. During the assault and after being knocked to the ground, Mr Field recalls one of the offenders pulling at his pants trying to grab his wallet. He put his hand over his pocket to prevent it from being stolen, and was kicked in the head by another offender causing him to lose consciousness.

32Whilst assaulting the victims, the offenders stole wallets from Raymond Wilkinson, William Wilkinson and Mr Field.

33After knocking all victims to the ground, the offenders ran back to Ms Swain's vehicle and yelled at her, ""Go, go, go!"". Ms Swain began driving to her house at Willmot. During the drive, she saw the offenders passing wallets between themselves and heard one of the offenders say ""If there's money in them, we'll split it"".

34After arriving at Ms Swain's house, the offenders started a small fire on the roadway and burnt the victims' wallets.

35Police and ambulance officers attended the victims a short time later. Police obtained security CCTV footage from the Quix Service Station, displaying Ms Swain's vehicle and the five offenders. 

36A search warrant was obtained for Ms Swain's home and, at about 5.00 am, investigators attended her Willmot address and executed the search warrant. During the search, police located a black leather wallet which was partially burnt on the roadway outside Ms Swain's house.

37Police also located Raymond Wilkinson's black leather wallet containing numerous cards and papers in his name. Ms Swain's vehicle was searched and police observed what appeared to be blood located on the right wheel arch. The vehicle was seized and towed to St Marys Police Station for forensic examination.

38After the execution of the search warrant, Ms Swain was conveyed to St Marys Police Station to provide a statement. She identified the Applicant as one of the five offenders whom she saw assault the four victims. A second statement was obtained from Ms Swain at a later date, in which she identified all of the offenders.

39As a result of the assaults, Raymond Wilkinson's jaw was broken in three places. He required surgery and the insertion of a number of screws and plates. He suffered a great deal of pain and was unable to eat or talk for a number of weeks. During the incident, his wallet containing about $160.00 was stolen.

40William Wilkinson sustained two black eyes, swelling to his face, large lumps to both his temples, numerous cuts to his mouth and a front tooth was snapped in half. During the incident, his wallet containing about $70.00 was stolen.

41Mr Field sustained swelling to his right temple, swelling to his left cheek, a cut to the end of his tongue, grazed knees and soreness to his head and neck. During the incident, his wallet containing $100.00 was stolen.

42Mr Perry sustained a fractured right cheekbone and swelling to his entire face. The fracture required surgery and the insertion of 11 screws and two plates.

43On 26 February 2009, investigators attended Silverwater Gaol and arrested the Applicant. He participated in a record of interview with police. He said that he remembered the incident and assaulting someone, but did not know anything about a robbery.

The Applicant's Subjective Circumstances

44The Applicant was 21 years' old at the time of the offences and 23 years of age at the time of sentence.

45The Applicant has a criminal history extending back to 2001 for a range of offences including offences of violence, dishonesty and driving offences. His criminal history included the following:

(a) offences in March 2003 of aggravated robbery (two counts) for which he was ordered to perform 50 hours' community service, and offences of assaulting and resisting police and driving a conveyance taken without consent, for which 12 months' probation was granted;

(b) common assault in August 2003 for which six months' probation was ordered;

(c) mid-range PCA and other driving offences in September 2003, for which he was fined and disqualified;

(d) larceny in November 2003, for which he was fined;

(e) in June 2004, the Applicant was called up for breach of probation and a suspended control order was granted;

(f) in July 2004, probation was granted for a common assault;

(g) in April 2005, a sentence in the form of a seven-day control order was passed for common assault;

(h) in July 2005, the Applicant was called up for breach of probation, and a seven-month control order, with a non-parole period of three months, was imposed;

(i) on 22 September 2006, the Applicant was sentenced in the Penrith District Court for assault occasioning actual bodily harm, assaulting police, common assault and not leaving a registered club, with a total effective term of imprisonment for one year and four months, with a non-parole period of seven months expiring on 13 October 2006 and a balance of term to expire on 13 July 2007;

(j) on 27 April 2007, the Applicant was sentenced at the Wyong Local Court, for possession of housebreaking implements and larceny, to fixed terms of six months' imprisonment, commencing on 18 April 2007 and expiring on 17 October 2007;

(k) on 11 May 2007, the State Parole Authority revoked the Applicant's parole order and he was ordered to serve balance of parole expiring on 13 July 2007;

(l) on 23 January 2008, the Applicant was sentenced at the Penrith Local Court for affray, failing to quit premises and, by way of call up for an offence of assault police, to 12 months' imprisonment suspended under s.12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

46The Applicant was subject to this suspended sentence at the time of the commission of all offences for which he was sentenced on 20 April 2010.

47On 12 March 2010, the Applicant appeared at the Penrith Local Court by way of call up for breach of his suspended sentence, and the sentence of 12 months' imprisonment was imposed with a non-parole period of nine months expiring on 11 December 2010. This sentence was entirely concurrent with the subject sentences imposed at the Penrith District Court on 20 April 2010. 

48Before the sentencing Judge were presentence reports dated 21 July 2009 and 8 April 2010, together with a report of Misia Temler, psychologist, dated 27 February 2009. In addition, the Applicant's father gave evidence at the sentencing hearing before the Penrith District Court on 16 April 2010.

49His Honour made extensive reference to these reports in his remarks on sentence. The Applicant's parents separated when he was three years' old and the Applicant left home at the age of 14 years. The documentary evidence indicated abuse of alcohol and drugs by the Applicant's parents. 

50His Honour referred to the Applicant's education and employment history and his drug and alcohol abuse:

""The offender has only a minimal education and limited employment history for short term labouring jobs and he partially completed a TAFE course after leaving school and had commenced a traineeship in 2007, however his arrest prevented him from completing the course. It is obvious before I even go any further that his real problem is that, he cannot discipline himself. Mr Shortland stated that he commenced drinking alcohol in his early teens and indicated that this increased steadily until he was arrested and placed on remand for the current offences, and on an average day he would drink spirits at 10am and continue drinking with his peers until drunk and he claimed that his own mother introduced him to cannabis at twelve. He quickly increased
smoking on a daily basis and by sixteen he was also using methylamphetamine on a daily basis and taking ecstasy on the weekends. He justified his use of ecstasy stating that it made him less aggressive than if he drank alcohol.""

51A little later, his Honour said:

""He stated that alcohol has been a contributing factor in all his offences and understood the need to address the issue, and in order to reduce his high risk of re-offending. He is currently classified as an A2 maximum security inmate at Parklea and he is a compliant inmate which is in his favour. The offender has not commenced any programs to address his anger or drug or alcohol issues whilst in custody. It is in his favour that he presents as polite. He is immature but he is polite and that is in his favour. He accepts readily the impact of alcohol and negative peer associations on his offending behaviour; but he has not developed any strategies to overcome it.""

52His Honour referred to the psychological report concerning the Applicant:


""There is an intelligence testing, his performance IQ is fine, it is at 108. He has some verbal difficulty. The profile is indicative of a substance abuse substance dependence disorder which seems obvious and the impression is that he is an immature young man, his behaviour has been shaped by his unstable upbringing and early and ongoing exposure to violence, drugs and alcohol and his needs problem [sic] with addressing his aggression, impulsiveness and anger management.""

53The sentencing Judge then addressed issues of remorse and the Applicant's prospects of rehabilitation:

Here is a young man who faces very serious charges and a young man who has had a destabilising and deprived background and a very unfortunate background. There are some expressions of remorse but the expressions of remorse in the report are self serving expressions. I do accept that there is some element of remorse in what he says, but I do conclude that the main focus is upon himself and there is not really any satisfactory evidence that he is actually sorry for what he has done to other people.

As to the likelihood of re-offending, the sad fact is that to date in his life he has never exhibited any discipline about anything, and when one looks at the opportunities he has had to embrace some attitudinal change. He has consistently turned his back on rehabilitation and one could never conclude at the moment that he is unlikely to re-offend. At the moment he has not come to terms with his problems and he has not developed the resolve to act as a responsible citizen. As to prospects of rehabilitation, he is young and one would have to say there is always some prospect with a young man, that one day they will see the light and I do regard his prospects of rehabilitation as fair. You could never conclude they are good but they are fair, principally because of his age.""

54The sentencing Judge adverted to other issues, including the Applicant's youth and substance abuse issues:

""He is a young man and he was a young man when he committed the offences but his age was not such as to preclude any lack of appreciation for the gravity of what he was doing. Any person of his age would know that these are serious matters and you cannot conduct yourself in this way without there being consequences and without being held accountable. I do not consider that his addictions diminish the objective gravity of the offence or his background diminishes the objective gravity, I do consider it provides a good explanation as to why he is here, but I do not consider it diminishes the objective gravity; at least not significantly. But it is obviously relevant as part of the subjective circumstances.""

Sentences Imposed on Co-Offenders in Respect of Offences of 21 May 2008

55The first ground of appeal arises from sentences imposed upon the Applicant's co-offenders in different Courts after the Applicant was sentenced in April 2010. Given the submissions made in this Court, to which I will return, it is appropriate to identity with some precision the offences for which each person was sentenced, the Court in which sentence was imposed, as well as the sentences actually passed. 

56As will be seen, it is the extraordinary fact that none of these other sentencing Courts were informed of the sentences imposed upon the Applicant, let alone provided with the remarks on sentence of his Honour Judge Frearson SC.

Jeffrey Chesher Sentenced in the Local Court on 2 July 2010

57On 2 July 2010, Jeffrey Chesher was sentenced by Magistrate Viney in the Penrith Local Court, following his plea of guilty to charges of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm in company (two counts) and assault occasioning actually bodily harm in company (two counts). For reasons that were not explained before this Court, the charges against Mr Chesher were disposed of summarily in the Local Court. 

58Mr Chesher was 23 years' old at the time of the offences and 25 years' old at the time of sentence. He had a record of prior convictions, including offences of violence, and had previously been sentenced to imprisonment for such offences. He was subject to conditional liberty at the time of the present offences. He pleaded guilty to the offences, but not at an early opportunity, with the sentencing Magistrate stating that the pleas had ""some utilitarian value"". 

59A term of imprisonment was imposed for each offence:

(a) for each of the two offences of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm in company, Mr Chesher was sentenced to imprisonment for 16 months from 2 July 2010, with a non-parole period of 10 months;

(b) for each of the two offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company, Mr Chesher was sentenced to imprisonment for 10 months from 2 December 2010, with a non-parole period of seven months. 

60The sentences were partially accumulated by a period of five months. 

61The total effective sentence for Mr Chesher comprised imprisonment involving a non-parole period of 12 months commencing on 2 July 2010, with a balance of term of four months. 

62Mr Chesher appealed to the District Court against severity of sentence. On 6 September 2010, he withdrew his appeal before the Penrith District Court, and the sentences were confirmed, to date from that day. 

63It is a surprising and disturbing feature that the remarks on sentence of his Honour Judge Frearson SC concerning the Applicant were not brought to the attention of Magistrate Viney in the sentencing proceedings against Mr Chesher. As a consequence, no parity issue arose for consideration. I will return to this topic later in this judgment. 

John Ika Sentenced in the District Court on 7 October 2010

64John Ika was sentenced at the Penrith District Court by Acting Judge Madgwick QC on 7 October 2010. Like Mr Chesher, Mr Ika pleaded guilty to charges of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm in company (two counts) and assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company (two counts). 

65Mr Ika was aged 19 years at the time of the offences and 22 years at the time of sentence.

66Mr Ika had a limited record of prior convictions. In the Children's Court, a non-custodial order had been made for an offence of robbery. In the Local Court, he had been convicted of driving offences. He had not previously been sentenced to imprisonment. The sentencing Judge said that ""in terms of [offences of] violence"", Mr Ika was ""entitled to be dealt with as if this was his first offence"" (ROS3).

67Acting Judge Madgwick QC characterised Mr Ika as the ""ring leader"" or ""precipitating agent"" in the incident on 21 May 2008 (ROS6). 

68Mr Ika pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity and a 25% discount was allowed for the utilitarian value of his pleas.

69Once again, it is a surprising and disturbing feature that Acting Judge Madgwick QC was not informed of the sentences which had been passed upon the present Applicant on 20 April 2010. 

70This Court was informed that the Crown representative had apparently formed the view that the differences between the position of the Applicant, and that of Mr Ika, were so great that an issue of parity or proportionality did not arise. This approach reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the relevant principles and the role of the Crown which, in this case, has contributed to a highly unsatisfactory state of affairs. 

71It was the duty of the Crown representative to furnish to Acting Judge Madgwick QC the remarks on sentence of his Honour Judge Frearson SC concerning the Applicant. Submissions could then be made by the Crown and Mr Ika's counsel concerning parity issues by reference to the sentences imposed upon the Applicant. However, this did not happen.

72Instead, Acting Judge Madgwick QC was informed of the sentences imposed in the Local Court upon Mr Chesher. No sensible explanation was provided to this Court as to how the remarks on sentence concerning Mr Chesher were provided to his Honour, but not those relating to the Applicant.

73Acting Judge Madgwick QC concluded on this issue (ROS6):

""All in all, having regard to the principles of parity that constrain a sentencing judge, I think I would fall into error if I were to sentence the prisoner to more than the head sentence that Chesher received.""

74In reaching this conclusion, his Honour acknowledged the jurisdictional limit on sentence in the Local Court, but observed that the sentences imposed upon Mr Chesher fell short of that limit. 

75With respect to the issue of accumulation, his Honour said (ROS6):

""I would ordinarily partially accumulate the sentences but in the circumstances it would be pointless to do so.""

76It was submitted in this Court that his Honour was referring here to considerations of parity with respect to the sentences imposed upon Mr Chesher in the Local Court.

77For each of the offences of recklessly cause grievous bodily harm in company, Mr Ika was sentenced to imprisonment for two years comprising a non-parole period of 11 months commencing on 31 May 2010, with a balance of term of 13 months. The sentences were to be served concurrently. 

78For each of the offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company, Mr Ika was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for six months commencing on 31 May 2010, to run concurrently with each other and with the sentences imposed on the other counts.

79The total effective sentence imposed upon Mr Ika was imprisonment for two years, comprising a non-parole period of 11 months and a balance of term of 13 months. 

OI Sentenced in the Children's Court on 13 July 2011

80The co-offender, OI, was dealt with by Magistrate Sbrizzi at the Parramatta Children's Court on 13 July 2011. He was sentenced for offences of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm in company (two counts) and assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company. He was ordered to perform 250 hours of community service and was placed on 12 months' probation.

81OI was aged 17 years and 11 months at the time of the offences and was 21 years' old at the time of sentence.

82Amongst other factors, the sentencing Magistrate had regard to the fact that OI had spent a period of four months and 25 days in custody. 

83There is no indication that the Magistrate sentencing OI in the Children's Court was informed of the sentencing outcome for the Applicant, let alone being provided with the remarks on sentence of his Honour Judge Frearson SC of 20 April 2010. 

JW Sentenced in the Children's Court on 10 August 2011

84JW was sentenced by Magistrate Sbrizzi at the Parramatta Children's Court on 10 August 2011 for offences of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm in company (three counts) and assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company. In respect of each offence, a suspended control order was imposed under s.33(1B) Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 for periods of between six and 12 months.

85JW was aged 17 years and four months at the time of the offences and was 21 years' old at the time of sentence.

86In sentencing OI and JW, the Children's Court Magistrate referred to the passage of time since the offences (more than three-and-a-half years) and the changed circumstances of each offender (each had become a father by 2011) as being relevant to sentence.

87In sentencing JW, Magistrate Sbrizzi referred to the early sentencing of OI, which his Honour distinguished on several bases.

88Once again, it does not appear that the Magistrate sentencing JW was informed of the sentence imposed upon the Applicant, let alone being supplied with the remarks on sentence.

Ground 1 - The Parity/Proportionality Ground

Submissions of the Applicant

89Mr Gartelmann, counsel for the Applicant, submitted that there is a gross lack of parity and/or due proportionality between the sentences imposed on the Applicant, and those imposed on his co-offenders arising out of the 21 May 2008 incident. Whilst acknowledging that any comparison of their respective sentences must take into account relevant differences, including different offences and jurisdictions and the respective subjective cases of the offenders, he submitted that the differences did not preclude the asserted lack of parity and/or due proportionality from giving rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the Applicant. 

90Mr Gartelmann submitted that the sentences imposed on the Applicant may reasonably be compared with those imposed on the two adult co-offenders (Mr Chesher and Mr Ika). Whilst acknowledging that Mr Chesher was sentenced in the Local Court where jurisdictional limits apply, he submitted that the sentences imposed on him were well below applicable limits and that it did not appear that this was a significant factor in determining the sentences. 

91Whilst acknowledging as well that the standard non-parole periods applicable in sentencing the Applicant did not apply in sentence proceedings in the Local Court, Mr Gartelmann submitted that this did not preclude proper comparison of the respective sentences. He observed that Acting Judge Madgwick QC, in sentencing Mr Ika, considered that a reason for departure from the standard non-parole periods was the requirement of parity with respect to the sentences imposed on Mr Chesher.

92Mr Gartelmann submitted that Mr Chesher and Mr Ika were each sentenced for an identical offence of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm in company, and that their respective sentences for this offence may readily be compared with the sentence imposed upon the Applicant for Count 6. Whilst the other offences for which they were sentenced differed, he submitted that the differences are not such as to preclude a comparison of the sentences imposed for them.

93Whilst acknowledging that (unlike the Applicant), Mr Chesher and Mr Ika were not sentenced for offences of robbery, counsel pointed to the similarity between other offences for which they were sentenced. He submitted that the Applicant's offences, and those of the co-offenders, each comprised elements of violence causing harm, constituted in each case by the same facts.

94Mr Gartelmann submitted that the sole discrete and different element in the Applicant's offences was the taking of property. He acknowledged that the differing maximum penalties and standard non-parole periods applicable to the offences must be taken into account, but submitted that neither the differing elements, nor the penalties applicable to the offences, was such as to preclude comparison of the sentences: Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at 473-474 [30].

95Counsel submitted that the differences between the offenders' respective subjective circumstances were such as to require differentiation in their respective sentences. However, they were not such as to justify the extent of disparity, or lack of proportionality, that resulted. He submitted that they did not justify the differing levels of accumulation of sentences for the offences arising from the incident - in the Applicant's case, a period of two years and six months; in Mr Chesher's case, a period of five months and in Mr Ika's case, the sentences were wholly concurrent.
96With respect to the co-offenders sentenced in the Children's Court, OI and JW, Mr Gartelmann acknowledged the need to take into account the constraints of the sentencing regime in that Court. However, he submitted that those sentences are not irrelevant in considering whether the Applicant's sense of grievance is justifiable: R v Govinden [1999] NSWCCA 118; R v Colgan [1999] NSWCCA 292.

97Mr Gartelmann submitted that the intervention of this Court is warranted in order to mitigate a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the Applicant, arising from a lack of parity and/or due proportionality between the individual and aggregate sentences imposed on him and those imposed on his co-offenders for the 21 May 2008 offences.

Crown Submissions

98The Crown submitted that the asserted amenability to comparison urged by the Applicant in this case is so qualified that any practical utility is artificial and meaningless. 

99The Crown emphasised that none of the other four participants in the joint criminal enterprise faced the exact same combination of offences as the Applicant, and that all but one was dealt with in the context of very different regimes (the Children's Court and the Local Court). Further, it was submitted that the differences in each offender's subjective cases were stark. 

100With respect to the Applicant, the Crown pointed to the other unrelated offences for which the Applicant was sentenced, together with the fact that each of his offences was committed in breach of a suspended sentence and whilst the Applicant was on bail, so that issues of personal deterrence and the need to protect the community loomed large. 

101Further, the Crown submitted that the Applicant's criminal history was significant, and could be distinguished from those of the other offenders. 

102With respect to the sentence imposed on Mr Ika by Acting Judge Madgwick QC on 7 October 2010, the Crown noted that he was sentenced for two offences of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm in company (upon Raymond Wilkinson and Simon Perry), and two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm committed in company (upon William Wilkinson and Jai Field). It was emphasised that the sentencing Judge had not been informed of the sentences imposed upon the Applicant, with the parity argument proceeding by reference to the Local Court sentences imposed upon Mr Chesher.

103The Crown submitted that, having received the benefit of two generous and arguably erroneous determinations, together with a finding of special circumstances, Mr Ika was sentenced to entirely concurrent sentences of imprisonment with him being released to parole on 30 April 2011, and with his sentence expiring entirely on 30 May 2012. 

104The Crown submitted that it was difficult to see how these sentences could be said to reflect the need for general or personal deterrence, and that entirely concurrent sentences did not appear to reflect the criminality in offences committed against different victims. The Crown submitted that the imposition of an excessively lenient sentence on one co-offender (Mr Ika) does not have the automatic consequence that a similar error should be made in the case of another on appeal (the Applicant).

105The Crown submitted that the only offence with commonality as between the different offenders was the offence of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm to Mr Perry (Count 6), for which Mr Ika was sentenced to two years' imprisonment, and for which a sentence of four years' imprisonment was imposed on the Applicant. However, the Crown submitted that the structure of the sentences imposed upon the Applicant was such that the Applicant will serve no term of imprisonment solely referrable to this offence, with considerations of totality requiring that it be completely subsumed in the sentences imposed on the other matters.
106The Crown submitted that there was no unjustified disparity in this case. The sentence imposed on Mr Ika for the relevant offence, it was submitted, was not such as to give rise to a legitimate or justifiable sense of grievance on the Applicant's part. Nor would it give the appearance in the mind of an objective observer that justice had not been done.

107The Crown submitted that, even if it were determined that unjustified disparity was demonstrated, there is no obligation to reduce a sentence to one which is inadequate: Green v The Queen at 475-476 [33].

Determination

108It is open to the Applicant to advance a parity or proportionality ground in this Court by reference to sentences imposed subsequently upon co-offenders: Jones v The Queen (1993) 67 ALJR 376.

109It is necessary, once again, for this Court to repeat some fundamental propositions concerning the sentencing of co-offenders.

110The High Court of Australia and this Court have emphasised repeatedly the strong desirability of co-offenders being sentenced by the same sentencing Judge or, if that is not practicable, the second sentencing Judge being fully informed of the sentence imposed upon a co-offender by the first sentencing Judge, with the remarks on sentence of that Judge being provided to assist and inform the sentencing process: Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606 at 617, 622; Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295 at 320; Dwayhi v R [2011] NSWCCA 67; 205 A Crim R 274 at 284-286 [32]-[47]; R v Chandler [2012] NSWCCA 135 at [94]-[96]; Arenilla-Cepeda v R [2012] NSWCCA 267 at [52], [87].

111It is also necessary to mention features relevant to an assessment of a parity ground of appeal, where different Judges have sentenced co-offenders. In Rae v R [2011] NSWCCA 211, with the concurrence of McClellan CJ at CL and Hidden J, I said at [52]-[56]:

""52 There are significant advantages where related offenders are sentenced by the same Judge at the same time, with remarks on sentence containing factual findings and conclusions concerning the relative criminality of the offenders and differing subjective features of each of them: R v Swan [2006] NSWCCA 47 at [71]; Gurney v R; Willetts v R [2011] NSWCCA 48 at [81]-[82]; Dwayhi at [39]-[43].

53 Different Judges may take different views as to the relevant culpability of related offenders: Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295 at 320; R v Mercieca [2004] VSCA 170 at [6]; Dwayhi at [35], [37].

54 Where co-offenders are dealt with separately, there may be differences in the substratum of facts upon which the different sentencing Judges act and the impressions formed by them with respect to the relative roles, levels of responsibility and prospects of rehabilitation of the individuals involved, with this flowing in part from the different emphases which can be expected to be placed on aspects of the offending behaviour and the circumstances of the offenders: R v Rodden [2005] VSCA 24 at [28]; Dwayhi at [38].

55 Strong maintenance of the practice of related offenders being sentenced by the same Judge at the same time will serve the public interest in consistent and transparent sentencing of related offenders which underlies the parity principle itself: Dwayhi at [46].

56 A recurring theme in the authorities is that, where co-offenders are sentenced after hearings before different Judges, there may be different evidence and submissions, leading to different conclusions being expressed by the sentencing Judges concerning criminal conduct of persons involved in the same criminal enterprise.""

112For the purpose of determining this appeal, I gratefully adopt the statement of principles of Garling J in Rees v R [2012] NSWCCA 47 at [50]:

""So far as I understand it, the authorities on the application of the parity principle in circumstances such as those with which this court is presented in this case, provide the following principles:

(1) The parity principle is an aspect of equal justice, which requires that there be consistency in punishment. Unequal treatment under the law is likely to lead to an erosion of public confidence in the integrity of the administration of justice: Lowe at 610-611 per Mason J; Postiglione at 301 per Dawson and Gaudron JJ, at 335 per Kirby J; Green v R; Quinn v R [2011] HCA 49 at 28 and 30 per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ;

(2) Because the function of imposing a sentence on an individual has a discretionary character, an appellate court will ordinarily be reluctant to intervene. There is no such thing as perfect consistency in sentencing. A search for perfect consistency is to look for the unattainable and will frequently be an exercise of academic abstraction: Postiglione at 336-7 per Kirby J, R v M (CA) (1996) 105 CCC (3d) 327 at [92] per Lamer CJ;

(3) Hence, the discrepancy required to be identified between sentences is one which is not merely an arguable one, but one which is 'marked', or 'clearly unjustifiable', or 'manifest ... such as to engender a justifiable sense of grievance' or else it '[appears] that justice has not been done': Lowe at 610 per Gibbs CJ (Wilson J agreeing), at 613 per Mason J, at 623-624 per Dawson J; Postiglione at 301 per Dawson and Gaudron JJ, at 323 per Gummow J, at 338 per Kirby J; R v Taudevin [1996] 2 VR 402 at 403 per Hampel AJA, at 404 per Callaway JA; DGM v R [2006] NSWCCA 296 at [46] per Latham J (McColl JA agreeing); Green at [31] per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ, at [105] per Bell J;

(4) The elimination of an 'unjustified' discrepancy is a matter of importance not just to the individual concerned, but to the administration of justice in the community more generally. This court is therefore concerned not with whether an appellant actually feels a sense of grievance, that is, a subjective test, but rather whether, examined objectively, the sense of grievance is a justifiable one, namely that a reasonable mind looking over all of what happened would see that a grievance was justified. In other words, the matter is considered objectively: Lowe at 613 per Mason J; R v Kelly [2005] NSWCCA 280 ; 155 A Crim R 499 at [11] per Johnson J (Simpson J agreeing); Postligione at 338 per Kirby J; Green at [31] per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ.

(5) In determining whether there has been a discrepancy of a kind sufficient to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, a court:

(i) must consider not just the head sentence, but all components of the sentence including the non-parole period and the total effective period that both offenders will serve: Postiglione at 303 per Dawson and Gaudron JJ, at 338 per Kirby J;

(ii) must also consider all of the facts and circumstances applicable to both individuals involved, including the objective seriousness of the offence, in order to identify whether a differential sentence was justified; Green at [30] per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ;

(iii) ought not intervene to reduce a sentence below a level, which would mean that the sentence would be wholly inadequate having regard to the offence involved and the criminality of the offender, and consequently the result would be an affront to the proper administration of justice: R v Chen [2002] NSWCCA 174 ; 130 A Crim R 300 at [289] per Heydon JA, Sully and Levine JJ; DGM at [58] per Latham J (McColl JA agreeing); Kelly at [12] per Johnson J (Simpson J agreeing); Green at [33] per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ.""

113It is necessary for the Applicant to demonstrate an objective foundation for his sense of grievance so as to render it legitimate. In Ng v R [2011] NSWCCA 227; 214 A Crim R 191, Bathurst CJ, James J and I said at 210 [82]:

""Where there is a degree of disparity so as to invite a reduction in the sentence imposed, it is not necessary for this Court to intervene if the result of doing so is to produce a sentence disproportionate to the objective and subjective circumstances. This Court will not necessarily intervene where the co-offender's sentence is so inadequate that the Court should not take it into account: Lewins v R at [7]; Dwayhi at 280-281 [21].""

114In Green v The Queen, French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ observed at 476 [33]:

""Whether or not the discretion to reduce a sentence to an inadequate level is available, marked and unjustified disparity may be mitigated by reduction of the sentence appealed against to a level which, although lower, is still within the range of appropriate sentences.""

115With these principles in mind, I approach the circumstances of this case.

116The reason why Mr Chesher was dealt with in the Local Court, rather than the District Court, was not explained before this Court. This reflected a generous approach on the part of the Crown, which had the effect of preventing the same sentencing Judge or Court dealing with Mr Chesher. There was an associated advantage to Mr Chesher in that the standard non-parole period had no application in his case and the jurisdictional limit upon sentence in the Local Court applied. The position was compounded by the serious failure of the Crown to inform the presiding Magistrate of the sentences imposed upon the Applicant on 20 April 2010, and to furnish the remarks on sentence to the Local Court. It was for the sentencing Magistrate to consider the relevance of the Applicant's sentence to that Court's function, with the assistance of submissions from the parties. It was not for the Crown to withhold the remarks on sentence from the Local Court.

117The problem is magnified further when one comes to the case of Mr Ika, the single co-offender actually dealt with in the District Court. His sentencing proceedings were conducted before a different Judge. Moreover, the sentencing Judge in Mr Ika's case was not even informed of the sentences imposed upon the Applicant, let alone provided with the remarks on sentence.

118However, this did not prevent a type of parity argument being advanced in the District Court by reference to the sentences imposed upon Mr Chesher in the Local Court. As a result, a distorted, incomplete and lop-sided parity argument was advanced in the case of Mr Ika, by reference to sentences imposed in the Local Court (with its jurisdictional limit) and with standard non-parole periods having no application, but with no reference at all to the sentences imposed upon the Applicant at an earlier point in time. 

119A fair-minded and objective member of the public might well wonder how all this occurred. With respect, the fact that it happened does not inspire public confidence in the criminal justice system. Erosion of public confidence in the integrity of the administration of justice is a recognised concern where the parity principle is to be considered: Rees v R at [50](1) (set out at [112] above).

120The ages of OI and JW led to each of those offenders being dealt with in the Children's Court. 

121With respect to offenders dealt with in the Children's Court, it is necessary for this Court to recognise that sentencing took place in a very different sentencing regime, but that does not mean that the sentences imposed in the Children's Court are irrelevant: R v Colgan at [15]; R v Wong [2003] NSWCCA 247 at [35]. Further, the fact that co-offenders were to be sentenced in the Children's Court was not a reason to withhold from the presiding Magistrate the remarks on sentence concerning the Applicant.

122There can be significant practical difficulties in comparing the sentences of participants in the same criminal enterprise who have been charged with different crimes. The greater the difference between the crimes, the greater the difficulties, particularly where disparity is said to arise from a sentence imposed on a co-offender who has been charged with an offence that is less serious than that of the Applicant: Green v The Queen at 473-474 [30].

123There are clear differences between the offences and penalties for which the various offenders came to be sentenced. There are also significant differences between the subjective circumstances of the various offenders, with the Applicant's position being worse than that of the other offenders.

124The Applicant was sentenced first in time with a substantial total effective term of imprisonment being passed for the offences which occurred on 21 May 2008. 

125The Applicant's co-offenders thereafter received vastly different and lesser sentences. 

126As the Applicant was sentenced first in time, he had no control over what was done thereafter on the prosecution or defence side with respect to his co-offenders. The Applicant might readily expect that the sentences imposed upon him would be brought to the attention of the judicial officers who came to sentence his co-offenders for the 21 May 2008 offences. However, this did not happen.

127Despite the very significant points of difference in charge selection and jurisdiction as between the various offenders, and despite the markedly lenient penalties imposed upon Mr Ika in the District Court, I am nevertheless persuaded that there is an objective foundation for a sense of grievance on the part of the Applicant, as a result of the sentences imposed on the other offenders involved in the serious crimes committed on 21 May 2008. 

128This conclusion does not entitle the Applicant to have his sentence adjusted, in some way, to bring it into line with those imposed on one or other of his co-offenders. Rather, as stated by the majority in Green v The Queen (at [114] above), marked and unjustifiable disparity may be mitigated by reduction of the sentences appealed against to a level which, although lower, is still within the range of appropriate sentences. 

129This leads to the position where the Applicant is entitled to have this Court take into account on resentencing, in a permissible way, the sentences imposed upon his co-offenders, in determining the appropriate sentences to be imposed upon the Applicant.

130I would uphold the first ground of appeal. The appropriate course will be to resentence the Applicant for Counts 3 and 6, the dominant sentences imposed for the 21 May 2008 offences.

131In light of this conclusion, the remaining grounds of appeal may be considered shortly.
 
Ground 2 - The Standard Non-Parole Period Ground

132The Applicant was sentenced well before the decision of the High Court of Australia in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120. 

133With respect to the offence of robbery in company with infliction of grievous bodily harm (Count 3), the sentencing Judge assessed the objective seriousness of the offence in the following way:

""Looking at it in that way I consider the objective gravity to be in the mid range but towards the lower end and I consider that to be the case notwithstanding that there was an element of spontaneity about it, there was a lack of planning. The fact is that the offender required little encouragement to involve himself in this serious matter. The standard non parole period will not apply because of the plea, but it remains a relevant consideration along with the maximum penalty. Some would say a very relevant consideration but I am mindful not to oscillate or vacillate around the standard non parole period. I do take it into account as a significant guide along with the maximum sentence. The reason to depart from the standard non parole period is essentially the plea and there may be a reason to depart on the basis of a finding of special circumstances, which I will get to later.""

134With respect to the offence of recklessly cause grievous bodily harm in company (Count 6), his Honour made the following finding:

""As to offence six, the recklessly committing causing grievous bodily harm in company, I have read out the facts of that offence and again I consider it to be within the mid range of objective gravity. The Crown submits it was at the lower end and it may be slightly towards the lower but it is certainly within the mid range. That offence again, carries the standard non parole period and I respect [sic] the reason for the departure from the standard non parole period is essentially the plea of guilty. I do not oscillate about the standard non parole period.""

The Applicant's Submissions

135Mr Gartelmann submitted that the sentencing Judge had determined that the reasons for departure from the standard non-parole periods, respectively applicable to these two offences, were essentially the pleas of guilty (for both offences) and the finding of special circumstances (for Count 6). He submitted that the sentencing Judge had adopted a two-stage approach to the determination of the sentences for these two offences: first, assessing the objective seriousness of the offence and, secondly, determining the reasons that existed for departure from their respective standard non-parole periods.

136Mr Gartelmann submitted that this approach was not permitted following the decision in Muldrock v The Queen and that it was erroneous as it gave the standard non-parole period ""determinative significance"". As a result, it was submitted that the exercise of discretion in determining the sentences for these two offences had miscarried.

Crown Submissions

137The Crown submitted that merely showing that a sentencing Judge had sentenced in the manner applicable before the decision in Muldrock v The Queen did not, of itself, demonstrate error, with it being necessary to consider whether, in the particular case, the approach taken had sufficiently infected a sentence so that this Court must intervene: Butler v R [2012] NSWCCA 23 at [26].

138The Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge in this case did not adopt the approach of commencing with the standard non-parole period, and then seeking to find factors which could justify a variation from it. It was submitted that his Honour had used the standard non-parole period as a significant guide, along with the maximum sentence.

Determination

139In Aldous v R [2012] NSWCCA 153, Davies J (Allsop P and Latham J agreeing) said at [31]:

""This is another in an increasingly long line of cases where sentences imposed prior to the High Court's decision in Muldrock are challenged as falling foul of what was said in that judgment. Some of the cases are collected in Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [36] and see also this Court's comments in Butler v R [2012] NSWCCA 140 at [26]. As Johnson J said in Zreika at [43], it is necessary to read fairly the entirety of a Sentencing Judge's Remarks to see how the standard non-parole period has been dealt with. As in Zreika the Sentencing Judge in the present case determined that the standard non-parole period was only to operate as a benchmark or guidepost in the exercise of her sentencing discretion. It cannot be said that it has been used as a starting point when her Remarks are fairly considered. Her use of the words 'the consequence' do not lead to the result that it was the starting point. Her approach of using the standard non-parole period as a benchmark or guidepost is consistent with the judgment of the High Court in Muldrock: Zreika at [43].""

140I am not persuaded that the sentencing Judge in the present case has undertaken a two-stage process contrary to the principles laid down in Muldrock v The Queen. 

141A fair reading of his Honour's remarks on sentence indicates that his Honour had regard to the standard non-parole period as a significant guide, along with the maximum sentence. I detect no error in this approach.

142His Honour's expression of ""reasons for departure"" from the standard non-parole period is a formula to be discouraged since the decision in Muldrock v The Queen. However, his Honour said, as well, that he did not ""oscillate"" around the standard non-parole period. A fair and practical reading of his Honour's entire remarks on sentence is required: Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [43].

143I am not persuaded that a fair reading of his Honour's remarks reveals error. 

144As it happens, because the first ground has been upheld, it will be necessary to resentence the Applicant for these offences.

145However, error has not been demonstrated as asserted in the second ground of appeal.

Ground 3 - Claim that the Sentence on Count 3 is Manifestly Excessive

146As the Applicant is to be resentenced on Count 3 arising from the success of the first ground of appeal, I do not consider it necessary to determine the third ground of appeal. 

147It is sufficient to observe that a substantial sentence was imposed, which was partly cumulative. However, where an offender is sentenced for several offences so that the principles of concurrency, accumulation and totality are brought into play, it is necessary for this Court to take care where challenge is made to one particular sentence of those which are imposed, so as to guard against an element of artificiality being introduced: R v Thalari [2009] NSWCCA 170; 75 NSWLR 307 at 320 [82]. The Court must keep in mind the obligation of a sentencing court to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence in accordance with the principles in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610. However, the selection of one sentence for challenge as being manifestly excessive, from a range of several partly accumulated sentences, requires particular caution on the part of this Court.

148It is not necessary to say more as the sentence upon Count 3 is to be set aside for other reasons.

Ground 4 - Claim that the Aggregate Sentence is Unreasonable of Plainly Unjust

149Once again, I do not consider that this ground requires any detailed consideration given the course to be taken concerning Counts 3 and 6.

150It must be kept in mind that the Applicant was sentenced for separate crimes committed at the Willmot Friendly Grocer on 20 February 2008.

151The sentencing Judge described the offence of 20 February 2008 (correctly) as a ""typical break and enter and steal offence"" and said ""there must have been some planning and some significant deliberation notwithstanding it was unsophisticated and the items taken were not insubstantial"".

152The robbery on 20 May 2008 involved a frightening attack upon the staff of the same small business, during which, as the sentencing Judge found, a ""strong young man ... manhandled a 41 year old woman"".

153It was necessary that appropriate sentences, partially accumulated, be imposed for these offences, committed as they were, whilst the Applicant was subject to conditional liberty.

154Further, there were four victims of the offences on 21 May 2008, committed as part of the one extended violent incident. A measure of accumulation was appropriate, with an eye still kept upon totality.

155It is not necessary to say more about this ground given the view which I have formed with respect to the first ground of appeal. 

Resentencing the Applicant

156As the first ground of appeal has been upheld, I am satisfied that the Court should intervene and that lesser sentences are warranted, for the purposes of s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912, with respect to Counts 3 and 6. 

157In approaching the question of resentencing on Counts 3 and 6, it is necessary to have regard to the objective gravity of the offences, the fact that the offences occurred whilst the Applicant was subject to conditional liberty, the Applicant's criminal history and subjective circumstances, and the need for both general and specific deterrence. It is necessary to consider the applicable standard non-parole periods and maximum penalties as statutory guideposts.

158It is necessary, as well, to take into account, in a permissible way, the sentences passed upon the Applicant's co-offenders. The facts did not differentiate between the acts of the various offenders (as to who did what), although John Ika was found by the sentencing Judge in his case to have been the ""ring leader"" or ""precipitating agent"" in the incident. 

159The offenders were to be sentenced as participants in a joint criminal enterprise: R v Wright [2009] NSWCCA 3 at [28]-[30]; R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49; 77 NSWLR 7 at 34-35 [160]-[162]. Of course, the principles in these cases are affected here by the different charges laid against the various co-offenders, and the different jurisdictions in which they were prosecuted.

160The offences of 21 May 2008 involved wanton violence on the part of the Applicant and his co-offenders following an inconsequential, innocuous and apparently good-humoured exchange between two groups of young men. The Applicant and his co-offenders then launched a vicious attack upon the victims in a public place, involving the inflicting of serious injury and theft of certain items from them.

161I would not interfere with the sentences imposed with respect to Counts 1, 2, 4 and 5, both as to length of the sentences and the measure of accumulation applied in each case. As observed at [149]-[155] above, it was necessary that sentences be passed for those separate offences with an appropriate measure of partial accumulation. I am satisfied that the sentences on these counts should be confirmed.

162The 25% discount allowed by the sentencing Judge for the Applicant's pleas of guilty should once again be applied on sentence for Counts 3 and 6.

163With respect to Count 6, I am satisfied that the sentence imposed should be quashed and that, in its place, after applying a 25% discount, a sentence of imprisonment should be fixed for a term of three years comprising a non-parole period of two years commencing on 26 February 2011 and expiring on 25 February 2013 with a balance of term of one year to expire on 25 February 2014.

164With respect to Count 3, I am satisfied that the sentence imposed should be quashed and, in its place, after applying a 25% discount, a sentence of imprisonment should be fixed for a term of six years comprising a non-parole period of three years commencing on 26 February 2012 and expiring on 25 February 2015 with a balance of term of three years commencing on 26 February 2015 and expiring on 25 February 2018. 

165The imposition of these sentences will see a total effective head sentence of nine years and six months comprising a non-parole period of six years and six months with a balance of term of three years. Given the Applicant's troubled history and the clear need for supervision and assistance in the community upon his release, a finding of ""special circumstances"" should be made to allow this outcome: Jinnette v R [2012] NSWCCA 217 at [107]-[108]; R v GWM [2012] NSWCCA 240 at [114]-[117].

166I propose the following orders:

(a) grant leave to appeal against sentence;

(b) allow, in part, the appeal against sentences imposed at the Penrith District Court on 20 April 2010;

2707185,R v Wang; R v Roizman [2013] NSWCCA 2,"Judgment
1McCLELLAN CJ at CL:  I agree with the orders proposed by McCallum J and in all but one respect with her reasons. 
2In my opinion the applicant Roizman was not denied procedural fairness. His Honour when sentencing was entitled to have regard to all of the relevant material in relation to Roizman's capacity in the English language and was not confined in the circumstances to the opinion of Dr Westmore. The record of interview was likely to be a reliable source for his Honour's opinion. I do not believe his Honour was bound to flag during the course of submissions that he may determine from his own observation of the applicant's capacity to speak English rather than prefer the opinion of Dr Westmore. 
3McCALLUM J:  Jian Ping Wang and Alexandr Roizman seek leave to appeal against the sentences imposed on them after each was found guilty by a jury of an offence relating to dealing with the proceeds of crime.  Wang was found guilty of an offence of dealing with the proceeds of crime to the value of $1 million or more being reckless as to whether the money was the proceeds of crime, contrary to s 400.3(2) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth).  Roizman was convicted of aiding and abetting the commission of Wang's offence, contrary to s 11.2(1) and s 400.3(2) of the Code.  The maximum penalty in each case was imprisonment for a period of 12 years and a fine of $79,200.  Wang was sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years and 6 months and a balance of term of 3 years and 6 months, giving a total sentence of 10 years.  Roizman was sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months and a balance of term of 4 years, giving a total sentence of 9 years and 6 months.
Circumstances of the offences
4The offences were committed as part of a sophisticated and carefully executed fraud perpetrated on the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme.  It is important to note, however, that the applicants did not participate in the fraud itself.  On 24 December 2003, false banking directions were sent to the custodian of the funds of the scheme, JP Morgan, purportedly from the investment manager of the funds, State Street Global Advisors.  With the assistance of an insider at JP Morgan, Mr Greg Bourchier, the false directions were purportedly verified by telephone, resulting in the transfer of AUD $150 million to four different bank accounts around the world, including the sum of HKD 175,624,839.38 sent to an account held with HSBC in the name of Hong Kong Power Limited.  The fraudulent directions requested that the transfer to that account settle on 29 December 2003, evidently in anticipation of a lower risk of detection at that time of year.
5The involvement of the applicants arose at the stage of laundering and retrieving the proceeds of the fraud.  A number of people were involved in either the fraud itself or the intended laundering and retrieval of the money.  The money that had been transferred to the Hong Kong Power account was made available on board a Macau-based casino boat named the ""Omar III"", to be used for playing baccarat.  The applicants travelled from Australia to Hong Kong, boarding the Omar III on the evening of 29 December 2003.  They exchanged the funds from the Hong Kong Power account for gambling chips whilst on board the boat.  At the end of a night's gambling, they cashed in the chips.  Receipts were issued to Roizman in the sum of AUD $16.7 million and another man involved in the laundering, Chan Wai Kong, in the sum of AUD $10.45 million.  A total of AUD $3.43 million was lost as a result of the gambling.
6On 30 December 2003, Roizman attempted to redeem the funds using the receipt issued at the casino. However, he was unable to do so, as the fraud had by then been detected and the funds frozen. 
7The learned sentencing judge's assessment of the nature and circumstances of the offences is conveniently summarised in the Crown's written submissions on the appeal.  As there stated, the judge sentenced the applicants on the basis that each was responsible for providing the Hong Kong Power account details and putting at risk the whole of the funds transferred into the account (approximately AUD $30.58 million); that each dealt directly with the funds in his gambling, resulting in a loss of approximately AUD $3.43 million; and that in each case the offence involved a very substantial sum of money and the loss of a substantial part of that money.
8The judge noted that the transfer of the funds into the Hong Kong Power account was the end-product of a sophisticated and carefully planned criminal enterprise, whilst acknowledging that the offenders were not themselves party to the actual fraud.  His Honour noted, however, that without their participation as launderers, the fraud could not have been completed.  His Honour inferred that, although any expected benefit was unknown, it must have been substantial.  Acknowledging that the applicants were to be sentenced for what they did rather than how it might be described, the judge found that each played the substantial or primary role in respect of the laundering offence and that the moral culpability of each offender was high.  His Honour described the offences as ""a very serious instance of such an offence"".  
9As to the roles and involvement of each offender, the judge made the following factual findings.
10As to the applicant Wang, he was involved in obtaining the account details for the Hong Kong Power account (involving regular telephone contact with the applicant Roizman and another offender, Mr Dallas Fitzgerald) and making arrangements for boarding and gaming on the Omar III.  He boarded the Omar III with a number of people including Roizman and played baccarat seated with Roizman over the course of eight or more hours using the funds that had been fraudulently transferred to the Hong Kong Power account.  
11He had meetings in Hong Kong including with Dallas Fitzgerald.  At least one of those meetings was to discuss what had gone wrong after it became apparent that the funds had been frozen and were not able to be accessed.  He met again with Dallas Fitzgerald upon his return from Hong Kong to discuss that issue.  He lied about a number of matters when questioned by police upon his return to Australia. He knew the funds dealt with were the proceeds of crime.
12As to the applicant Roizman, the judge rejected Roizman's version of events given at trial that a man named Sergei had invited him to Hong Kong and invited him to gamble with his money, threatening him upon his return to Australia to speak to no one.  The judge found that Roizman had a clear idea of the amount of money involved in the trip, at least to the extent that he was aware of the amounts issued to him on the boat and the amount of the receipt issued at the conclusion of the gambling. 
13The judge found that Roizman was involved in obtaining the Hong Kong Power account details, having assisted Wang in that respect by consenting to be listed as the tenant on a property which was the address to which the account details had been faxed.  After playing baccarat with Wang over the course of the night, Roizman was issued with a receipt in his name for HKD $95,924,000,000 (approximately AUD $16.7 million).  He travelled to Macau where he attempted to redeem the funds recorded in the receipt but was unable to do so.  He told a number of lies when interviewed by police and knew that the funds he was assisting Wang to deal with were the proceeds of crime.

Circumstances of the applicants
14Wang had previous convictions including a conviction for making a false instrument, for which he was sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 3 years.  The judge found that the prior convictions indicated a greater need for specific deterrence and deprived Wang of the degree of lenience to which he might otherwise have been entitled.
15The applicant Roizman had a stronger subjective case, having been diagnosed in September 2002 with chronic myeloid leukaemia and depression following that diagnosis.  Roizman had a subsequent conviction of an offence of obtaining a false passport which, although post-dating the offence, deprived him of a basis for claiming that he was of entirely good character.  The detail of Roizman's medical condition is considered further below.
16The judge found that neither applicant had shown contrition or remorse, since each continued to deny his guilt and that, in that circumstance, neither had any real prospect of rehabilitation.
Grounds of appeal relied upon by Wang
17Grounds 1, 2 and 5 relied upon by Wang raise issues of disparity between the sentence passed on him and those passed on other offenders involved in the same undertaking.  It is generally appropriate to deal with such a ground last, since it is brought on the premise that the sentence is otherwise appropriate: Pham v R [2009] NSWCCA 25 at [17] per Latham J; approved in Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60 at [251] per Campbell JA.  Accordingly, I turn first to consider grounds 3 and 4.
Alleged denial of procedural fairness
18Ground 3 is:
The applicant was denied procedural fairness in that the sentencing judge failed to warn those acting for him that he proposed to impose a sentence longer than that indicated during the proceedings on sentence.
19The principles relevant to the consideration of that ground are not in dispute.  It is well-established that an accused person is entitled to procedural fairness during criminal proceedings including, upon conviction, during the proceedings on sentence:  Pantorno v R [1989] HCA 18; 166 CLR 466 at 473 to 474, [11] to [12] per Mason CJ and Brennan J; at 483, [12] per Deane, Toohey and Gaudren JJ; Weir v R [2011] NSWCCA 123 at [64].  
20The issue of what is required to be demonstrated in order to establish a denial of procedural fairness was considered by the High Court in a different context in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6; 214 CLR 1. Relevantly for present purposes, it is clear that the applicant must demonstrate that he was deprived of an opportunity to advance submissions so as to result in unfairness in the procedural sense:  see generally Lam at [29] to [34] per Gleeson CJ.
21It is also clear that the content of the requirements of fairness may be affected by what is said or done during the proceedings:  Lam at [34].  That is a critical consideration here.  The premise of ground 3 is that the sentencing judge indicated during the proceedings on sentence that he would pass a sentence in the order of that passed on Chen.  In my view, that premise is not established.
22The applicant's argument on this ground may be summarised in the proposition that the Crown put forward the sentence imposed on Chen as the appropriate sentence to be imposed on Wang and that the judge did not foreshadow any inclination to view the matter otherwise.  In my view, nothing in the submissions made on behalf of the Crown was such as to represent or concede that the exact same sentence should be imposed on each of the two men.
23The first exchange relied upon by Wang occurred in the context of his application for bail following the jury's verdict of guilty.  The Crown said in that context that the decision in Chen would be ""a significant factor in establishing a tariff applicable to these two offenders"".  However, it is clear from the transcript that those remarks were made only to sustain the submission that a period of imprisonment was inevitable for both offenders, a consideration put forward as the Crown's basis for opposing bail (application book volume 1, page 21.21). 
24At the proceedings on sentence, the Crown submitted that ""for the purpose of parity, the sentence imposed by her Honour (sic) Judge Marien in Jian Hua Chen ... is appropriate"".
25Counsel proceeded to identify points of comparison between the two offenders which might be taken into account in one direction or the other.  In particular, he acknowledged that neither Wang nor Roizman had been involved in recruiting anybody, a factor differentiating Chen's role as being more serious.  On the other hand, counsel noted that the fact that funds were actually lost could be taken into account ""in the other direction"".
26I do not think anything in that exchange amounted to a concession by the Crown or a representation by the sentencing judge that, absent some indication to the contrary, Wang would receive the exact same sentence as Chen.  His counsel had a full opportunity to respond to the propositions put by the Crown.  He exercised that opportunity in the following exchange:
Spencer:   Your Honour could I simply say this about Chen, and perhaps I should have said before.
His Honour:  You'll need to be quick Mr Spencer.
Spencer:   Chen is a principal, my client is not.
His Honour:   Yes Mr Spencer.
Spencer:   That's all there is to say Your Honour.
27Those were submissions which his Honour was entitled to accept or reject, as he saw fit.  I do not think there was any indication of the kind accepted in other cases (considered further below in the context of a similar ground relied upon by Roizman) that Wang would receive the same sentence as that passed on Chen.  In my view, ground 3 is not made out.
Manifest excess
28Ground 4 relied upon by Wang is that the sentence was manifestly excessive in all the circumstances.  It was submitted that, with a maximum penalty of 12 years, a total term of imprisonment of 10 years was manifestly outside the appropriate range.  Acknowledging the difficulty of making a comparative review of other sentencing decisions under s 400.3(2) of the Code, Wang submitted that more modest sentences were imposed in other cases involving a similarly significant amount of organization, planning and complexity, citing Ansari v R [2007] NSWCCA 204; 173 A Crim R 112; R v Van Dang Dran [2007] NSWDC 310; R v Wing Cheong Li; Wing Cheog Li v R  [2010] NSWCCA 125; 202 A Crim R 195 and Regina v Z [2006] NSWCCA 342; 167 A Crim R 436.
29The applicant submitted that the distinguishing feature in the present case is the amount of money involved.  In my view, that submission overlooks the breathtaking brazenness of laundering such an enormous sum of money by gambling it over eight hours.  Whilst I accept that the sentence imposed was a stern sentence, I am not persuaded that it did not fall within the proper sentencing discretion of the judge.
Grounds of appeal relied upon by the applicant Roizman
30Roizman alleges disparity between his sentence and those imposed on others (grounds 2 and 2A in his appeal).  Those grounds are addressed below, together with the disparity grounds relied upon by Wang.  
31Ground 1 relied upon by Roizman is: 
that the sentence imposed was unduly harsh and severe.  
32The applicant sought to sustain that submission principally by reference to the JIRS statistics for principals under s 400.3(2), noting that there are no JIRS statistics for aiders and abetters.  It was noted that the statistics show only ten persons dealt with under the section, of whom 80% were sentenced to imprisonment for 54 months or less, with only one person receiving a sentence in excess of 5 years.  It was further noted that non-parole periods in the statistics range from 30 months to 7 years with 90% receiving a non-parole period of 36 months or less and only one person receiving a non-parole period of over 3 years.
33I do not think that resort to the JIRS statistics establishes error in the present case.  As noted on behalf of the Crown, it has been observed previously by this Court that the wide range of circumstances in which money laundering offences may be committed make comparisons with other cases virtually impossible and the sentences imposed in such cases of limited assistance: R v Wing Cheong Li; Wing Cheong Li v R at [40]-[41] per Barr AJ; Allsop P, Basten JA, McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J agreeing at [1], [2], [3] and [6] respectively.
34Probably the most comparable case for sentencing purposes is the decision involving the co-offender Chen considered below in the context of the parity grounds.  Having regard to the matters there discussed, I do not think that decision establishes manifest excess in the sentence imposed on the applicant Roizman.  It may be noted that, in Ansari v R at [130]-[148], allowing a Crown appeal, the Court expressed the view that a sentence of at least 9 years imprisonment would have been appropriate at first instance (in a case involving a significant sum but one which was substantially smaller than that involved in the present case and where there was no circumstance akin to the applicants' gambling or any resultant loss to others).
35I am not persuaded that the sentence imposed on Roizman in the present case was outside the permissible range of the sentencing judge's discretion.
36Ground 3 is:
that the sentencing judge erred in contravening the rule in De Simoni v R (1981) 147 CLR 383.
37A similar ground was argued in the decision of this Court in Chen.  The relevant offence in each case consists in dealing with money reckless as to whether the money was the proceeds of crime.   As already noted, there is a more serious offence of dealing with the proceeds of crime believing the money to be the proceeds of crime, which carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment (s 400.3(1)).  
38In Chen, the sentencing judge found that the offender knew ""right from the outset"" that the enterprise involved dealing in illegally obtained money.  It was submitted on that basis that his Honour had breached the principle arising from R v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; 147 CLR 383 in that he took into account a fact that was relevant to an element of a more serious offence than that for the offender was being sentenced.  
39In considering that ground, Howie J said in Chen (at [23]):
But it is obvious that there is a more serious offence arising where a person dealing with money over $1 million believes that the money is the proceeds of crime, and such an offence carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment: see s 400.3(1). Even though recklessness of a circumstance as an element of an offence under the Code can be proved by actual knowledge of that circumstance, when sentencing for an offence under s 400.3(2) the distinction must be maintained between the less serious offence involving recklessness and the more serious offence involving belief, see Ansari at [131].

40Roizman submitted that the sentence passed in the present case ignored those remarks and departed from sentencing on the basis of recklessness, taking into account elements of the more serious offence involving belief.  Within that submission, it was acknowledged that the sentencing judge was well aware that Roizman had not been convicted of the more serious offence.  However, it was submitted that the judge ""nevertheless made a specific factual finding that the applicant was aiding and abetting Wang and knew that Wang was committing the offence.  The sentencing judge also made a specific finding that the applicant did in fact know that the funds he was dealing with were the proceeds of crime.""
41It was on the strength of those findings that it was submitted the sentencing judge ignored the remarks in Chen.
42It must be noted that the sentencing judge specifically referred to the remarks in Chen and faithfully recorded their tenor.  His Honour said (ROS page 7) (dealing with the offender Wang):
However, the offender was not charged with the more serious offence provided by s 400.3(1) of the Criminal Code where it must be proved that the offender ""believes"" the money to be the proceeds of crime.  In sentencing for this offence the Court must maintain the distinction between the more serious offence provided by s 400.3(1) and the less serious offence involved here, s 400.3(2), which requires proof of being ""reckless"" and has a maximum penalty provided of 12 years imprisonment:  Ansari [2007] NSWCCA 204 at [131]; Chen [2009] NSWCCA 66 at [23].
43In the face of those remarks, in my view the submission that his Honour ignored the principle there clearly stated is untenable.  Ground 3 must be rejected.
44Grounds 4 and 5 are:
4. That the sentencing judge erred in failing to distinguish the criminality of the offender from that of his principal.
5. That the sentencing judge erred in his assessment of the criminality of the applicant [Roizman].
45The judge said (ROS page 10):
In relation to this matter, attaching a label to the role played by the offenders in respect of the offence each has been convicted of would not be a productive exercise.  They should be sentenced for what they did rather than how it might be described: R v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270.  They played the substantial or primary role in respect of the offence.  While each performed different acts, or participated in performing the same or similar acts, during the commission of the offence by them, and Roizman has been convicted on a charge of aiding and abetting Wang, the Court finds that there is no real utility in the circumstances in assessing their individual moral culpability as it is so alike as to not justify distinction.  The moral culpability of each offender is high.
46Roizman submitted that those remarks reveal that the judge ignored the distinction between principal and accessory.  In my view it is plain that his Honour did not.  He specifically referred to the fact that Roizman had been convicted on a charge of aiding and abetting but assessed the respective criminality of both applicants by determining what they actually did, concluding by reference to that yardstick that their individual moral culpability was indistinguishable.  As submitted on behalf of the Crown, that was an appropriate and correct approach.
47In order to determine whether the conclusion (that the individual moral culpability of the applicants was indistinguishable) was open to the sentencing judge, it is necessary to consider a series of individual points raised in Roizman's submissions in support of the contention under ground 5 that the judge overestimated Roizman's criminality.
48First, it was submitted in paragraph 5(a) of the written submissions that the judge's overestimation of Roizman's criminality is revealed in his Honour's specific reference to the whole fraudulent undertaking involving $150 million, even though the Crown did not allege that either applicant was aware of the precise fraud or the total quantity of money involved.
49It is clear that his Honour did not take that into account in assessing the criminality of the applicants.  His Honour expressly noted that the applicants were not party to the overall fraud or to the transfer of funds into the Hong Kong Power account: see ROS at page 10.
50Roizman further submitted at paragraph 5(b) of the written submissions that the judge wrongly rejected the proposition that Roizman was not aware of the actual sum involved and also wrongly rejected the proposition that there were probably more people laundering the money by gambling at the casino than just the two applicants.  It is clear, however, that the judge gave proper regard to the limitations of the evidence on those issues.  His Honour found (ROS page 8):
Roizman had a clear idea of the amount of money involved in his trip to Hong Kong, at least to the extent that he was aware of the amounts issued to him on the boat, that he gambled with, and that he had issued to him as a receipt.
51The amount transferred into the Hong Kong Power account was approximately AUD $30 million.  The balance left after the night of gambling was approximately AUD $27 million.  The receipt issued to Roizman was in the sum of AUD $16.7 million.  It is clear from his Honour's findings set out above that his Honour sentenced Roizman only on the basis of the amount issued in the receipt and whatever amount (unknown) was issued to Roizman in chips on the boat.  The judge made no finding as to the number of persons recruited to launder the money by gambling on the boat.  In any event, it is difficult to see how the involvement of others might lessen the culpability of the applicants, whose receipt of AUD $16.7 million at the conclusion of the night reveals on any analysis their having gambled with an extremely large sum.  
52Roizman further submitted at paragraph 5(ii) (presumably intended to be 5(c)) of the written submissions that it was not open to the judge to make the following finding, recorded at ROS page 10:
While the offenders were not party to the overall fraud and did not transfer any funds into the HK Power account they were responsible for providing the account details and putting at risk the whole of the funds transferred into the account, approximately AUD $30.58 million.
53Allied to that was the further complaint at paragraph 5(c) of the written submissions as to the judge's finding (ROS page 8) that Roizman was involved in obtaining the account details in that he assisted his friend Wang by being listed as the tenant on the Pyrmont property to which the account details were faxed.
54It was submitted that there was no evidence that Roizman was ever aware of the account details or that he provided them to anyone else.  There is substance in that complaint.  The Crown responded by noting that the judge found that Roizman was involved with obtaining the account details, since he assisted Wang by being listed as the tenant on the Pyrmont property to which the account details were faxed.  In my view, that is a tenuous connection with Wang's conduct in obtaining the account details and it is does not answer the complaint of there being no evidence that Roizman provided the account details.  Nonetheless, the sting of the conduct recorded in the judge's finding set out above was the fact that the fund was put at risk with a night of gambling.  
55Upon a consideration of the matters raised on behalf of Roizman, I am not persuaded that the sentencing judge failed to distinguish between the criminality of the two applicants or overestimated the criminality of Roizman's conduct.  Whilst I accept that the judge has overstated Roizman's involvement in obtaining the account details, his Honour's findings were otherwise in accordance with the jury's verdict and open on the evidence.  The acts for which Roizman was sentenced included travelling to Macau to board the Omar III, helping to gamble the Hong Kong Power funds, receiving the receipt in a substantial sum to enable the funds to be redeemed, returning to Macau and attempting to recover the laundered funds with the receipt.
56In my view it was open to the judge to conclude that, notwithstanding some greater involvement on Wang's part in obtaining the account details and having more extensive communications with other co-offenders, Roizman's moral culpability was indistinguishable from Wang's and that the culpability of each was high.  It is plain from the remarks on sentence that the principal factor contributing to that assessment was the laundering itself through a night of gambling with an extremely large fund.  Ground 5 must be dismissed.
57Ground 6 is:
that the sentencing judge erred in the way in which he dealt with Roizman's physical disability.
58There was uncontested evidence that Roizman suffers from chronic myeloid or lymphocytic leukaemia.  He was first diagnosed in September 2002.  He was at the time of sentence and at the time of hearing the appeal waiting for a bone marrow transplant.  The condition has no certain prognosis and is potentially fatal.
59The judge considered the evidence on that issue and concluded (ROS at page 14):
Dr Brown makes no prognostication as to life expectancy.  It is reasonable to expect that should a relapse occur which cannot be effectively treated that there would be serious consequences for the offender.  However, it cannot be ignored that the offender committed the offence while fully cognizant of his illness.
60Roizman submitted that his Honour was wrong to dismiss the effect of the condition on that basis.  In so submitting, it was acknowledged that the judge observed (ROS page 17):
That is not to say that his state of health would not impact adversely on him while in custody nor that it is not a relevant consideration on sentence.
61It was submitted, however, that those remarks were not reflected in the sentence imposed and that the important consideration was the ever-present risk that the offender's life would be untimely cut short.
62However, as noted on behalf of the Crown, there was no evidence before the judge as to Roizman's life expectancy, nor any evidence to support a conclusion that there was a serious risk of imprisonment having a gravely adverse impact on his health.  
63The judge referred to the principles regarding the relevance of an offender's psychological and medical health outlined in the decision of this Court in R v Hart (NSWCCA unreported, 26 July 1999) where it was noted that such matters may increase the hardship of a sentence and be taken into account on that basis in determining the appropriate sentence, but that such consideration is limited by the need to maintain proper standards of punishment.  
64The judge's remarks on sentence reveal that his Honour gave consideration to those principles and considered the evidence as to the likely treatment Roizman would receive and the ultimate impact of those matters on the hardship of his sentence.
65His Honour allowed a reduction in what was then regarded as the usual proportion between the non-parole period and the balance of term ""to reflect the possibility that [Roizman's] health may make serving a term of imprisonment less comfortable than it might otherwise be"" (ROS at pages 20-21).
66I am unable to discern any error in his Honour's approach to that issue.
67Grounds 7 and 8 are:
7. The sentencing judge failed to take into account the mental disability of the applicant.
8. The applicant was denied procedural fairness.
68The procedural fairness point relates specifically to the judge's treatment of an aspect of the evidence of Dr Westmore, forensic psychiatrist.  In his report dated 6 April 2010, Dr Westmore said:
This man will find incarceration a very difficult experience because of his age, his health problems and his poor English skills, which are causing him to become isolated within the prison population.  His depression is also aggravating that particular problem.
69In respect of that evidence, the judge said (ROS page 15):
To the extent that Dr Westmore referred to poor English skills I note that during the trial objection was taken to an electronically recorded interview with the offender being admitted in evidence.  No interpreter was present or requested as the interview was conducted in English over approximately 75 minutes excluding breaks.  I quote from the judgment dismissing the application:
The accused's ability to understand questions and respond in English supports a conclusion that the fact that an interpreter was not used did not in any way reflect the reliability of the admissions.  His grammar may not have been perfect and he may on occasion have struggles with his English expression but this had no significant impact.
The Court does not accept that Dr Westmore has an accurate understanding of the offender's English skills.
70Roizman submitted that, in light of a concession made by the Crown during the trial (that Roizman was not particularly familiar with English and required some concession and understanding that he may not have perfectly understood what he was being asked or the answers given) and further in light of the fact that the Crown did not contest Dr Westmore's assessment of Roizman's poor English skills and their likely contribution to the difficulties he would encounter during incarceration, the judge breached procedural fairness in refusing to accept Dr Westmore's understanding of Roizman's English skills without giving Roizman an opportunity to make submissions to the contrary.
71As noted above in respect of the natural justice ground relied upon by Wang, the entitlement of an offender to procedural fairness during proceedings on sentence is well-established.  The obligation may extend to putting an offender on notice if unchallenged evidence as to a matter in mitigation is not to be accepted: see R v Ryan [2003] NSWCCA 202; 141 A Crim 403 at [27] to [29] per Grove J; Ipp JA and Shaw J agreeing at [1] and [69] respectively.  
72In order to determine whether the applicant was deprived of an opportunity to advance submissions so as to result in unfairness in the present case, it is necessary to give careful attention to the way in which the issue unfolded in the present case.  Before the trial commenced, the judge ruled on an application to exclude a record of interview between police and Roizman (application book volume 2, transcript of 9 February 2010 at T34.44).  His Honour's reasons for admitting that material are not included in the application books.  For present purposes, it is enough to note that, as revealed in his Honour's remarks on sentence, the record of interview was objected to on the basis that the interview was conducted without the benefit of an interpreter for Roizman and that his Honour was evidently not satisfied that this affected the reliability of the admissions made.  
73The proceedings on sentence were not heard until 30 July 2010, almost six months later.  The evidence relied upon by Roizman included the report of Dr Westmore, set out above.  The report was tendered by consent and was not the subject of any cross-examination by the Crown (transcript 30 July 2010 at page 18.40; application book volume 1 at page 35).
74In submissions on sentence, counsel for Roizman read the passage of the report set out above and made the following submission:
As I said, I couldn't say it any better.  It's a matter that your Honour can and will no doubt take into account in accordance with the sentencing.  Thank you Your Honour.
75That was the conclusion of counsel's submissions.  The judge did not respond to the submission, calling next on counsel for the applicant Wang (transcript 30 July 2010 at page 24; application book volume 1 at page 41).
76The extent of Roizman's English skills was an important premise of Dr Westmore's opinion that Roizman would find incarceration ""a very difficult experience"".  It seems likely that his Honour's rejection of that premise undermined the force of the opinion in his Honour's assessment.  His Honour made no further reference in the remarks on sentence to the isolation within the prison population which Dr Westmore considered was being caused by Roizman's poor English skills, a factor Dr Westmore considered was aggravated by Roizman's depression.
77As revealed by the remarks on sentence set out above, his Honour's reason for rejecting the premise accepted by Dr Westmore was the conclusion his Honour had reached, almost six months earlier, as to Roizman's ability to understand questions and respond in English during the record of interview.  It cannot be said that the connection between the extent of Roizman's ability in the English language for the purpose of determining the reliability of admissions and, separately, for the purpose of enduring a term of imprisonment in an English speaking jail is so obvious that counsel ought to have anticipated his Honour's reflection on that issue.  In my view, with great respect to the sentencing judge, his Honour's failure to flag his inclination to reject a critical and uncontested premise of Dr Westmore's opinion amounted to procedural unfairness.
78It follows, in my view, that there was a denial of procedural fairness.  However, it is necessary to consider its significance.  In the present context, the principles at common law as to the appropriate remedy for a denial of procedural fairness stand under the umbrella of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  The applicant submitted that the denial of procedural fairness caused a ""practical injustice"" in that he lost the opportunity to make submissions to the decision maker in opposition to a proposed course and in support of a course which he urged, citing Lam at [36] and Button v R [2010] NSWCCA 264 at [18].  
79Button was a case in which the sentencing judge had given a clear indication of a view that the appropriate non-parole period would be 12 months.  The Crown had not sought to address on that issue.  Inexplicably, after reserving his decision, the judge passed sentence with a non-parole period of 18 months.  Applying the remarks of Gleeson CJ in Lam at [35] and [37], the Court held that the applicant had demonstrated a ""practical injustice"" and that the applicant was entitled to receive the sentence that had been accepted by the judge and the parties as an appropriate sentence in all the circumstances:  at [18] per Latham J; Simpson and Kirby JJ agreeing at [1] and [2] respectively; see also Weir v R [2011] NSWCCA 123 where a similar argument was accepted on the strength of similar reasoning: at [68] to [80] per Garling J; Macfarlan JA and Johnson J agreeing at [1] and [2] respectively.
80It is not necessary for present purposes to decide whether the judgment of Gleeson CJ in Lam imposes a requirement on an applicant to demonstrate an unfair outcome (or ""resulting unfairness"": cf Weir at [74]).  For my part, I have always understood the Chief Justice's remarks to be directed to the need to establish practical unfairness in the procedure itself.  His Honour's description of procedural fairness as an essentially practical concept, the concern of which is to avoid practical injustice, emerged from the recognition that the mere departure from a representation does not in itself demonstrate unfairness.  That is not to say that I would disagree with the result in either Button or Weir.  In each case, it was clear that the applicant had been deprived of an opportunity to advance submissions so as to result in unfairness in the procedural sense.
81However, those were both cases in which the procedural unfairness in question was a departure from a representation as to the appropriate sentence.  The position is different where the departure from the requirements of procedural fairness is a failure to foreshadow the rejection of uncontested evidence, as occurred in the present case.  The determinative question is whether, on the assumption that the evidence had been accepted, it is demonstrated that a less severe sentence is warranted in law: cf s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act.  If that were established, it might be appropriate for this Court either to invite submissions on the issue as to which submissions were not invited below or to remit the matter for re-sentence on that premise.
82However, where it can confidently be concluded that, even accepting the evidence rejected below, no less severe sentence is warranted, I do not consider it appropriate for this Court to intervene, notwithstanding the denial of procedural fairness.  In my view, that is the position in the present case.
83Ground 9 is that the sentencing judge erred in his finding on rehabilitation.
84The judge said (ROS page 17):
Both offenders maintain their innocence, despite the verdicts in the circumstances of a strong Crown case.  There is no real prospect of rehabilitation in the absence of an acknowledgment of the offending behaviour.
85It was submitted on behalf of Roizman that that statement was wrong both in fact and in law.  Specifically, Roizman submitted that his lack of significant offending both before and since the offence at hand should have militated against such a dogmatic statement.
86I do not think the judge intended the statement as a proposition of universal truth.  The remarks on sentence must be read for what they are, namely, his Honour's reasons, based on all of the material before him, for passing the sentences in question.  The real issue is whether it was open to the judge to find that there was no real prospect of rehabilitation on all of the evidence before him.  Whilst different conclusions might have been reached on that issue, I am unable to conclude that the finding his Honour articulated was not open on all of the evidence.
Alleged disparity with sentences imposed upon other offenders
87In the absence of particular error or manifest excess in the sentences imposed, it remains to consider the grounds based upon alleged disparity.
88Grounds 1 and 2 relied upon by Wang, which may conveniently be considered together, relate to the learned sentencing judge's consideration of the sentence imposed on another offender involved in the same fraudulent undertaking, Jian Hua Chen.  Those grounds are as follows:
Ground 1:  
His Honour failed to properly assess the moral and criminal culpability of the offending of Mr Wang, in comparison to a related offence, Mr Jian Hua Chen.
Ground 2:
The applicant is left with a justifiable sense of grievance given the sentence that was passed on Mr Chen.
89Chen was sentenced by Judge Marien SC after pleading guilty to conspiring with others (including the applicants) to commit an offence under s 400.3(2) of the Code, the section under which the applicants were charged.  The maximum penalty he faced was accordingly 12 years imprisonment and a fine of $79,200, the same penalty as was faced by the applicants. 
90The judge sentencing Chen indicated that he proposed to discount the sentence by 25% to reflect the plea of guilty entered at the earliest opportunity.  His Honour would have imposed a total sentence of 8 years imprisonment but, after the discount, passed a sentence of 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years and 7 months.  The proportion of the non-parole period to the total sentence reflected what was then considered to be at the lower end of the appropriate sentencing pattern (but now see the decision of the High Court in Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45 at [36] to [44]).  His Honour's reason for bringing the non-parole period in at the lower end of that ""pattern"" was that the sentence imposed for the offence at hand was to be accumulated upon another sentence imposed for offences committed subsequently but dealt with first.  
91An appeal by Chen against that sentence was dismissed by the Court of Criminal Appeal:  Chen v R [2009] NSWCCA 66.
92Chen was involved in attempting to recover the funds which had been transferred to another of the four accounts the subject of the fraudulent banking directions in respect of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme.  The funds in that account were frozen before any part of them was accessed and accordingly there was no loss from that account, a distinction noted by Marien DCJ.  His Honour noted that Chen was not involved in any way with the removal of the funds from the Hong Kong Power account or the gambling at a loss of those funds.
93As acknowledged on behalf of the Crown, Chen had recruited others to assist him and, in that respect, his offending was more serious than that of Wang or Roizman.  Conversely, however, their offending involved a greater sum of money; involved the gambling of the funds for the purpose of laundering them through the gaming board on the Omar III and in fact led to a substantial loss.
94Their conduct was otherwise relatively comparable.  It appears that the other account had been established at Chen's request, a point of distinction from the present applicants pointing to a greater role on Chen's part.  Conversely, each had obtained the details for the relevant bank accounts; liaised with other offenders in passing on that information and travelled to Hong Kong to assist with the recovery of the funds.  
95In considering the sentence imposed on Chen, the learned sentencing judge in the present case said (ROS page 19):
His Honour Marien DCJ sentenced Jian Hua Chen for conspiracy to deal with money to the value of $1 million or more being proceeds of crime contrary to s 400.3(2) and s 11.5(1) of the Criminal Code.  Although a conspiracy offence it is the same offence as the court is now concerned with and the maximum penalty available is the same.  The penalty imposed was imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years and 7 months.  Chen entered a plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity and remorse was taken into account.  His offence involved an entirely separate account in Hong Kong and all of the transferred funds were recovered.  He was found to be occupying a ""position at least at mid level"" in the organisational hierarchy of the conspiracy relating to the Lun Tun trading company account.
Marien DCJ in the circumstances determined a starting point of 8 years.  An appeal on sentence by Chen was dismissed.  Having considered that sentence I am of the opinion the offence committed by each of these offenders is objectively very serious and in each case involves a high degree of moral culpability.  This matter requires the imposition of a more significant sentence than indicated by Marien DCJ's starting point to reflect that and to provide an appropriate sentence.  
96In dismissing Chen's appeal against sentence, this Court endorsed the judge's finding that the offence was above the middle range of seriousness and proffered the view that it was ""well above"":  at [34] per Howie J; Beazley JA and Blanch J agreeing at [1] and [2] respectively.
97Wang submitted that the judge erred in assessing Wang's criminality as being higher than Chen's.  I do not accept that submission.  The two respects in which Chen's offending was more serious were that it was he who requested that the account be established whereas in the case of Wang, bank account details were provided to him; and secondly that Chen recruited others in the undertaking whereas Wang did not.
98Conversely, however, Chen did not obtain access to any funds at any point, whereas Wang gambled (along with Roizman and another) the Hong Kong Power fund over a period of eight hours resulting in a loss in the order of AUD $3.5 million. It was open to the judge to regard that as a significant point of distinction, as his Honour evidently did.  Further, as acknowledged in Wang's submissions, Chen had the benefit not only of a plea of guilty but of a finding of remorse.
99As to the sum of money involved and the fact that the Hong Kong Power fund suffered a loss, Wang submitted that, since the judge did not find that Wang knew the extent of the money involved, the total amount should not have resulted in his offending being assessed at such a high level.  In my view, that ignores the significance of the fact that, over a period of eight hours, three men including Wang racked up gambling losses in the order of millions.  The simple proposition reflected in the finding of the sentencing judge is that the law pays regard to consequences.  I am not persuaded that error is established in respect of the judge's assessment of the applicant's criminality compared with that of Chen's.  In my view, it was open to his Honour to assess those matters as he did.  
100As to ground 2, no further issue was raised in the submissions beyond those considered in respect of ground 1 above.  I am not persuaded that the difference between the sentences imposed on Wang and Chen is such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of Wang.
101Ground 5 relied upon by Wang (added by leave at the hearing of the appeal) is:
That the applicant is left with a justifiable sense of grievance given the sentence that was imposed on [a person referred to as X], Jamieson Vincent, Thomas Anthony Vincent, Gregory Bourchier, Ernest Hufnagl and Barry Osbourne.   
102It is convenient to consider that ground together with grounds 2 and 2A relied upon by Roizman, which are that the sentencing judge erred in distinguishing or rejecting comparative cases and that the sentencing judge erred in failing to achieve parity.  
103Those grounds must be approached bearing in mind the significant limitations on reducing a sentence on the basis of that of a co-offender sentenced for a different offence.  Some of the limits were identified by Campbell JA in Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60 at [203] (Howie agreeing at [246]; Rothman J agreeing at [270]) as follows (citations omitted).

1. It cannot overcome those differences in sentence that arise from a prosecutorial decision about whether to charge a person at all, or with what crime to charge them: Howard; Wurramarbra; Formosa
2. If it is used to compare the sentences of participants in the same criminal enterprise who have been charged with different crimes, there can be significant practical difficulties.  Those practical difficulties become greater the greater the difference between the crimes charged becomes, and can become so great that in the circumstances of a particular case a judge cannot apply it, or cannot see that there is any justifiable sense of grievance arising from the discrepancy: Gibson; Howard; Formosa
3. It cannot overcome differences in sentence that arise from one of the co-offenders having been given a sentence that is unjustifiably low: Armstrong; Diamond; Rexhaj; Isamundar
4. There are particular difficulties in an applicant succeeding in a disparity argument where the disparity is said to arise by comparison with the sentence imposed on a co-offender who has been charged with an offence that is less serious than that of the applicant: Krakouer; Pham; Woodgate.  See also R v Stanbouli [2003] NSWCCA 355; 141 A Crim R 531 at [127]-[134].  However Nguyen stands as one example where that result arose. 

104As to four of the co-offenders identified in ground 5, I do not see any substance in the complaint of disparity.  Thomas Anthony Vincent pleaded guilty to an offence of dishonestly causing a loss to a Commonwealth entity contrary to s 135.1(3) of the Code, which carries a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment.  He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 3 years with a recognizance release order to operate after 2 years.  
105The circumstances attending the passing of sentence on Vincent are so different from those of the applicant as to render sensible comparison impossible.  The applicant submitted that Vincent ""pleaded guilty to a much less serious charge than any of the other participants in the enterprise and the agreed facts cast him in a more favourable light than did the evidence in other related proceedings"".  The lesser seriousness of the charge contributes to the difficulty of comparison: cf Jimmy at [203(4)].  The contention that the agreed facts cast Vincent in a more favourable light than the evidence in other related proceedings is not a proper consideration in assessing a parity ground.  As carefully explained in Jimmy, such a ground is no warrant for the court to recalibrate the impact of the charges and evidence preferred by the Crown or the facts admitted by a co-offender to sustain a plea: at [203] per Campbell JA; at [247] per Howie J; at [267] per Rothman J.  
106Any comparison of the sentence imposed upon the applicant Wang with that imposed upon Vincent is further complicated by the fact that Vincent was, at the time he was sentenced, serving a sentence of 10 years with a non-parole period of 6 years for supplying a commercial quantity of prohibited drugs.  The sentence passed on him in respect of the fraud was entirely concurrent with the existing drug sentence.  Whilst the applicant complains that Vincent served no extra time for his significant involvement in the enterprise, the difficulty is that the need to apply the principle of totality in that circumstance further undermines the efficacy of any sensible comparison between the two sentences.  
107Gregory Bourchier, Ernest Hufnagl and Barry Osbourne each stood trial on a charge of conspiring intentionally and dishonestly to cause a loss to a Commonwealth entity, contrary to s 11.5(1) and s 135.4(3) of the Code.  The maximum penalty for that offence is 10 years.  Osbourne and Hufnagl were each sentenced to a term of imprisonment for a period of 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years.  Bourchier was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for a period of 5 years with a non-parole period of 2.5 years.  
108All were sentenced on the basis that they played an important but relatively limited role in the conspiracy.  They had, between them, facilitated the transition of the fraudulent banking instructions which resulted in the sum of $150 million being transferred out of the superannuation scheme fund.  Bourchier, an employee of JP Morgan, provided a legitimate copy of the form of instructions used between State Street Global and JP Morgan to transfer funds overseas from the superannuation account, together with some notes in relation to possible legitimate sources of those funds.  Osbourne, employed by Telstra as a line serviceman, was recruited by Hufnagl to access the telephone exchange with a view to manipulating the telephone lines so as to enable the fraudulent instructions to be sent as if from State Street Global (in fact that was ultimately unsuccessful and that is how the conspiracy was uncovered).  Hufnagl was an associate of Vincent and had the necessary communications with Osbourne.
109The sentence judge said ""I accept that in each case their roles were instrumental to the success of the conspiracy, but to the extent that it is necessary to make these findings towards the bottom in terms of the overall hierarchy"".  That is to be contrasted with the finding made in respect of the applicants in the present appeal that each ""played the substantial or primary role in respect of the offence"" (ROS at page 10).
110The judge considered their sentences and concluded that they were of no assistance in relation to the consideration of the sentences to be imposed on the applicants (ROS at page 19).  
111A closer comparator may be found in the sentence passed on Jamieson Vincent, who pleaded guilty to an offence of conspiracy to deal with money to the value of $1 million or more reckless as to whether it was the proceeds of crime contrary to s 400.3(2) of the Code, the section under which Wang and Roizman were charged.  Jamieson Vincent accordingly faced the same maximum penalty of 12 years imprisonment.  He was sentenced to 3 years imprisonment with a recognizance release order to operate after 20 months.
112At the time he was sentenced by Nicholson DCJ in November 2010, Jamieson Vincent was serving a term of imprisonment of 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years for two counts of supplying a commercial quantity of ecstasy.  His involvement in the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme conspiracy was limited to acting as a messenger in the attempts of the co-offenders to collect the funds from the Hong Kong Power account.  He was described by the sentencing judge as ""a lowly player"".  
113Perhaps the co-offender who may be seen to have got off the most lightly by comparison with the applicants is the offender referred to in the proceedings as ""X"".  He was convicted after trial of the more serious offence of conspiracy to deal with money to the value of $1 million or more believing it to be the proceeds of crime (as distinct from the reckless as to whether it was the proceeds of crime) contrary to s 11.5(1) and s 400.3(1) of the Criminal Code.  That offence carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment.  X was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 4 years and 8 months with a non-parole period of 3 years.  Allowing for a discount for assistance to authorities, the starting point for his sentence was 7 years.  
114A significant point of differentiation as that X was aged 22 years at the time of the offence.  His youth was an important consideration. The sentencing judge found that he was ""a young man acting very stupidly"" and that he had very good prospects of rehabilitation (ROS page 10).
115Further, X was sentenced on the basis that the amount of money which might have been obtained had the enterprise been successful was limited to the sum of money in the Hong Kong Power account of over $20 million rather than the whole sum of $150 million transferred out of the superannuation compensation scheme.  It was submitted on behalf of the applicant Wang that X was involved in the whole scheme but that does not appear to have been the approach taken by the sentencing judge.  
116In all the circumstances, I am not satisfied that either applicant should have a justifiable sense of grievance in respect of any of the sentences passed on any of the co-offenders.  It follows, in my view, that the appeals must be dismissed.
117For those reasons, the orders I propose in each appeal are that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.
118GARLING J:  I agree that leave to appeal ought to be granted, and the appeals dismissed as proposed by McCallum J. 119I do not share her Honour's conclusion, expressed in [78], that there was a denial of procedural fairness to the applicant Roizman. However, this disagreement, does not affect my agreement with the orders which her Honour proposes.

2707190,R v Rae [2013] NSWCCA 9,"Judgment

1Macfarlan JA: I agree with Button J.

2Price J: I agree with Button J.

3Button J: This is a Crown appeal pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against a sentence imposed on 26 August 2011 by his Honour Judge Robison in the District Court of New South Wales sitting at Newcastle.

4The respondent had pleaded guilty to four offences. The first was aggravated break enter and steal offence pursuant to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. The circumstance of aggravation was that the respondent was in company when he committed that offence. There was an applicable maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years, and a standard non-parole period of imprisonment for 5 years. 

5The second offence was discharging a firearm with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm, pursuant to s 33A of the Crimes Act. That offence attracted a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years. 

6The third offence was unauthorised possession of a prohibited firearm, pursuant to s 7(1) of the Firearms Act 1996. That offence attracted a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years, and a standard non-parole period of imprisonment for 3 years. 

7Finally, his Honour dealt with an offence of unauthorised possession of ammunition, pursuant to s 65(3) of the Firearms Act. That matter was placed before the Court on a certificate pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. That matter resulted in a fine of $200 being imposed. In light of its relative lack of seriousness and its disposition, it will not be discussed in detail in this judgment.

8His Honour imposed an aggregate sentence with regard to the three offences, pursuant to s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Before doing so, his Honour indicated the sentences that would have been imposed for each individual offence if an aggregate sentence had not been imposed, pursuant to s 53A(2)(b) of the same Act. 

9With regard to the aggravated break enter and steal, his Honour indicated that there would have been imposed a head sentence of imprisonment for 3 years 9 months with a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months. With regard to discharging the firearm, his Honour indicated that a head sentence of 5 years 7 months would have been imposed. In accordance with s 54B(4A) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, his Honour did not indicate what non-parole period would have been imposed with regard to this offence, because it did not attract a standard non-parole period. With regard to the possession of the firearm, his Honour indicated that, if an individual sentence had been imposed, there would have been a head sentence of imprisonment for 2 years 7 months with a non-parole period of imprisonment for 1 year 11 months. 

10Ultimately, his Honour imposed an aggregate head sentence of imprisonment for 5 years 7 months with an aggregate non-parole period of imprisonment for 4 years.

11Annexed to this judgment is a diagram that seeks to express the structure of the aggregate sentence and the indicative sentences in a readily comprehensible form. 

12It is immediately noteworthy that the aggregate head sentence imposed is identical with the indicative head sentence that would have been imposed for the second offence if an individual sentence had been imposed for that offence.

Objective features

13There was no dispute between the parties in the District Court as to the facts of the four offences. Nor was there dispute about that topic in this Court. 

14As for the first offence, on 13 July 2010 the respondent and a co-offender broke through the roof and ceiling of a veterinary practice. His Honour found that there was a ""significant element of planning"". Various medications that could be used illicitly were gathered up from the premises. As well as that, a floor safe containing a large amount of veterinary medication, including tranquilisers, was taken from the scene. The practice had obviously been deliberately targeted. The value of the items taken was in the order of $16,000. About $4,000 worth of damage was done to the premises.

15As for the second offence, on 16 July 2010 the victim, a young man of 26 years of age, was driving his truck in the Newcastle area. The respondent, who was driving a car, came across him without planning to do so. They were known to each other and there had been some previous animosity between them. The respondent swung his car in front of the truck, thereby blocking its progress. Each man alighted from his vehicle and a confrontation developed. The respondent produced a pistol. Although he had not expected to come across the victim, it seems that the respondent had available to him in the car a pistol and ammunition whilst he was driving around. The respondent pointed the pistol at various parts of the body of the victim, including his head, from a distance of no more than three metres away. He also said the words ""I'll fucking kill you"". The victim turned to run. The respondent discharged the pistol and a projectile entered the body of the victim from behind. He felt a burning sensation to his left thigh. The respondent decamped. Subsequently the victim was treated in hospital and had an operation to remove the projectile. He remained in hospital for three days. By the time of the remarks on sentence, the victim had made a full recovery.

16The facts of the third offence were as follows. On searching the home of the respondent, the police located a shortened firearm fitted with an empty magazine. To be clear, that was not the pistol that had been discharged on the occasion giving rise to the second offence. Ammunition was found on the same occasion, but it did not fit the shortened firearm. The firearm was not stored securely, and there were children in the home. 

Subjective features

17The respondent pleaded guilty in the Local Court and received a discount of 25 per cent as a result. That discount plays no role in this appeal. 

18Despite the early plea, his Honour did not find that the respondent was remorseful with regard to any offence.

19The respondent was born in August 1985. Accordingly, at the time of the offences, he was a little short of his 25th birthday. At the time of sentence in August 2011, he was about to turn 26. 

20The criminal record of the respondent was not unblemished. Although neither overly lengthy nor featuring extended periods of imprisonment, it had a flavour of threats and violence. In February 2005, when the respondent was 19 years of age, he was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and menacing driving. He was given a bond for each offence in the Local Court. On call-up he was sentenced to imprisonment for 4 months in the same Court. On appeal against severity to the District Court, he received a short sentence of periodic detention for both offences. In June 2006 he was charged with common assault. In the Local Court he was sentenced to imprisonment for 4 months. On appeal that sentence was reduced to periodic detention as well.

21In April 2007 he was convicted of possessing a prohibited firearm and common assault. He received a total sentence of imprisonment for 6 months. On the same day he was charged with receiving or disposing of stolen property. That resulted in a head sentence of imprisonment for 12 months with a non-parole period of imprisonment for 9 months. 

22In July 2007 the respondent was charged with stalking or intimidating with intent to induce fear of physical or mental harm. For that offence he received a sentence of imprisonment for 3 months.

23In October 2008, the respondent was charged with two counts of common assault. He received a sentence of imprisonment for 1 month for those offences. 

24There was also a number of driving offences scattered throughout the criminal record of the respondent that it is not necessary for me to recount.

25The respondent was bail refused after his arrest for the offences under discussion on 16 July 2010. By the time of the proceedings on sentence in August 2011, there was a deal of documentary evidence that showed that the respondent had used that year in custody constructively, and in particular had been seeking to address issues of substance abuse and violent behaviour. 

26The most important subjective material placed before his Honour came in the form of a letter from the cousin of the respondent, Ms Leah Martin. In short, it showed that, when the respondent was aged 15 years, his father committed suicide after a long battle with mood disorders, including bipolar disorder. Referring to the respondent and his brother, Ms Martin remarked ""I cannot even begin to relate or explain how deeply my Uncle's death affected my cousins, their mother, my own mother and extended family and of course myself"". 

27Eight years later, in May 2008, the respondent's mother lost her own battle with severe depression and grief. She also committed suicide. The cousin of the respondent said in the letter ""[a]gain there are really no words to describe how this two fold tragedy has affected Michael and Joshua, and their brother Ben"". The letter concluded with the cousin indicating that she would continue to give as much support as she could to the respondent and his siblings. She noted that ""[m]ost have found it difficult to know how to support my cousins effectively under such difficult, heart breaking circumstances, therefore, Ben, Michael and Joshua have often not had what they needed, or perhaps have not recognized it in their grief."" 

28His Honour did not recount this central subjective feature in any depth in the remarks on sentence. However, it is apparent that His Honour accepted it without demurrer. 

Some procedural aspects

29The solicitor appearing for the Crown and counsel appearing for the respondent in the District Court both accepted that there should be a degree of partial accumulation. Very shortly after counsel for the respondent made that clear orally, his Honour suggested that ""an aggregate sentence under the recent amendments to the legislation"" could be imposed. Neither the solicitor for the Crown nor counsel for the respondent made submissions to the contrary. Neither of them was asked by his Honour at that stage whether that could have any effect on the question of partial accumulation. After his Honour had made the remark about imposing an aggregate sentence, neither lawyer renewed his submission about the topic of partial accumulation.

30The remarks on sentence were delivered and sentence imposed on 26 August 2011. The Director of Public Prosecutions signed a notice of appeal on 16 September 2011. That document was filed and served upon the respondent on 21 September 2011. 

Grounds of appeal

31Three grounds of appeal were notified. I shall deal with each of them in turn.

Ground one

""The indicative sentence pronounced in respect of Count 2 (s.33A offence) is manifestly inadequate and fails to reflect the objective seriousness of that offence."" 

Determination

32At the hearing in this Court, counsel for the Crown was asked whether that ground could be maintained as a separate ground of appeal. That was on the basis of the words of s 5D(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, which are as follows:

""The Attorney-General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any sentence pronounced by the court of trial in any proceedings to which the Crown was a party and the Court of Criminal Appeal may in its discretion vary the sentence and impose such sentence as to the said court may seem proper.""

The simple point was that in truth his Honour pronounced only one sentence in the District Court: the aggregate sentence with regard to all three offences. The indicative sentences were, by their nature, not pronounced. Nor would it be appropriate for this Court to ""impose"" any sentence with regard to an offence upon which no sentence had been imposed at first instance. 

33Counsel for the Crown accepted that the correct approach would be to consider all of the submissions as to the inadequacy or otherwise of the indicative sentence with regard to the second offence when this Court came to consider ground three. That approach accords with the recent decisions of this Court in PD v R [2012] NSWCCA 242 at [44] and R v Brown [2012] NSWCCA 199 at [17].

34It follows that I would not uphold ground one as a separate ground. 

Ground two

""His Honour erred in imposing an aggregate sentence that failed to reflect any degree of partial accumulation""

Submissions

35It will be recalled that the indicative head sentence for the second offence was imprisonment for 5 years 7 months, and that that period is identical with the aggregate head sentence imposed with regard to all three offences. That must mean that the indicative head sentence of 3 years 9 months for the first offence, a serious offence committed entirely separately from the second offence, is not reflected by way of implicit accumulation in the aggregate head sentence. The Crown submitted that that state of affairs demonstrates of error. 

36It will also be recalled that both parties in the District Court submitted that there should be some degree of partial accumulation.

37Senior counsel for the respondent in this Court submitted that perhaps his Honour had increased the aggregate non-parole period to 4 years beyond what would have been its length otherwise, in order to reflect the criminality encompassed in the first and third offences. In other words, she submitted that, although no accumulation can be seen in the aggregate head sentence, perhaps it is reflected in the aggregate non-parole period. 

Determination

38It may be accepted that sentencing judges who are dealing with multiple offences have a very wide discretion as to questions of accumulation, concurrence, and partial accumulation and partial concurrence. However, it is not easy to understand how it is that the aggregate head sentence seemingly reflects none of the criminality of, at the least, the first offence, reflecting as that offence did a serious, planned break enter and steal in company that was entirely separate from the second offence, and that was committed by an offender who had previously been sentenced to imprisonment for a property offence.

39I turn to consider the submission of senior counsel for the respondent. No indicative non-parole period was expressed for the second offence. That means that one cannot undertake a comparison between what the non-parole period of that offence would have been, and the aggregate non-parole period actually imposed, in order to test the submission of senior counsel for the respondent. However, it is noteworthy that the indicative non-parole period for the third offence is 74 per cent of the indicative head sentence, and the indicative non-parole period of the first offence is 67 per cent of the indicative head sentence. The aggregate non-parole period is a little under 72 per cent of the aggregate head sentence actually imposed. In short, a comparison of the ratios between the indicative head sentences and the indicative non-parole periods of the first offence and third offence with the ratio between the aggregate head sentence and the aggregate non-parole period does not support the proposition that his Honour has increased the aggregate non-parole period in order to reflect questions of partial accumulation.

40Secondly, that would be an unusual way for a sentencing judge or magistrate to reflect questions of accumulation. The more usual approach, even with regard to the relatively new process of aggregate sentencing, would surely be to increase first the head sentence, and then the non-parole period to a commensurate degree.

41It follows that for two reasons I respectfully reject the submission of senior counsel for the respondent that this Court should proceed on the basis that the aggregate non-parole period reflects considerations of partial accumulation.

42It is true that, pursuant to the new procedure, a single aggregate sentence was imposed reflecting the criminality of all three offences. Therefore to speak of questions of partial accumulation is perhaps not entirely apt. 

43However, I consider that Parliament called for sentencing judges and magistrates to indicate the sentences that would have been imposed with regard to individual charges or counts so that an analysis of the kind that the Crown has asked this Court to undertake is available.

44It may be that there was, with respect, perhaps some misunderstanding as to the relationship that an aggregate head sentence must have to indicative head sentences. It is noteworthy that, as I have said, his Honour imposed an aggregate head sentence that is identical with the longest indicative head sentence in circumstances in which both parties accepted that there must be partial accumulation. 

45Of course, the newly available option of aggregate sentencing will free sentencing judges and magistrates from the laborious and complicated task of creating a cascading or ""stairway"" sentencing structure when sentences for multiple offences are being imposed and partial accumulation is desired. That will be especially beneficial in cases where an offender is to be dealt with for a very large number of offences. However, merely because an offender is to receive an aggregate sentence does not mean that considerations of accumulation, whether partial or complete, need no longer be taken into account.

46In all of the circumstances outlined by me above, I consider that the submission of the Crown has force. I consider that it was an error for the aggregate head sentence not to reflect some degree of cumulation as between the three offences. In particular, I consider that the conclusion is unavoidable that the separate and serious criminality encompassed by the first offence should have led to some implicit accumulation upon the indicative head sentence expressed for the second offence, and that accumulation should have been reflected in the aggregate head sentence.

47I would uphold ground two. 

Ground three

""The resulting aggregate sentence is manifestly inadequate.""

48I shall first consider the complaint about the indicative head sentence for the second offence, which previously formed the basis of ground one.

Submissions

49The Crown submitted that the objective gravity of the second offence was profound. It featured the discharging of a pistol at close range in the direction of a fleeing victim. It had been preceded by an ordeal that must have induced terror and fear of death in the victim. Because it is not an element of the offence, the fact that, as a result of the discharge of the firearm, a projectile actually entered the body of the victim must be a serious aggravating feature. Although the offence was unplanned, it did feature the respondent using his own motor vehicle to block the progress of the truck being driven by the victim. That meant that the victim could not escape and led to the confrontation. There was no suggestion that the respondent had somehow been provoked, or that the shooting could be in any way justified. The maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years was emphasised. 

50Reference was made to the fact that heavy sentences are imposed for the offence under consideration. Particular reference was made to the decision of Melbom v R [2011] NSWCCA 22. In that matter, a head sentence of imprisonment for 15 years with a non-parole period of 9 years 6 months was not disturbed by this Court. However, counsel for the Crown conceded that the consequences of the offence in that case were extremely grave, and could be sharply contrasted with the consequences of the offence here, in that the victim in that matter had suffered amputation of her leg as a result of a gunshot wound. 

51Senior counsel for the respondent resisted the proposition that the indicative sentence for the second offence was manifestly inadequate. She drew the contrast with Melbom v R to which I have just referred. She also sought to develop an argument founded upon the analysis undertaken by this Court in cases such as Sproates v R [2009] NSWCCA 29. That was done whilst accepting that, in that case, the extent of the harm actually suffered was an element of the offence, and therefore amenable to more detailed analysis as to its seriousness.

52Senior counsel emphasised the compelling subjective features of the adolescence and early manhood of the respondent, and the progress that was already in evidence by the time his Honour came to sentence the respondent. She submitted that the indicative sentence is not manifestly inadequate.

Determination

53I have already indicated that, in my opinion, ground two should be upheld. I have also approached the question of the manifest inadequacy of the indicative sentence for the second offence on the basis that it is nothing more than a particular of ground three. In those senses, my consideration of the latter question is not determinative of the appeal. Having said that, I think it is useful for me to express an opinion about the submission.

54It is true that the offence demonstrated very substantial objective criminality. Balanced against that must be the tragic subjective circumstances of this case. Whilst it is true that the respondent was not free of criminality before he had appeared before his Honour, and his criminal record included periods in custody, those periods were short. The sentence was the subject of the utilitarian discount to which I have referred. It is well established that this Court should be slow to determine that a sentence is erroneous on the basis that it is manifestly inadequate or excessive, and should only do so when the sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust: see House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505 and Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [25]. Although I regard the indicative head sentence expressed with regard to the second offence as being remarkably lenient, in all of the circumstances I do not consider that it fell outside the discretion available to his Honour. It follows that I would not characterise it as erroneous by way of being manifestly inadequate. I therefore reject this part of the Crown submissions with regard to ground three. 

55I turn to consider whether the aggregate head sentence and the aggregate non-parole period can be characterised as manifestly inadequate. 

Submissions

56The submissions of the Crown on this final question did not go much beyond what had been said with regard to ground one and ground two. The Crown submitted that the aggregate head sentence and aggregate non-parole period simply did not reflect the criminality contained in all three offences. Emphasis was placed upon the fact that the first offence was an entirely separate incident from the second offence, even though they were separated by the passage of only a few days. 

57Senior counsel for the respondent emphasised the unusual subjective features and characterised them as compelling. She submitted that the respondent had, by the time of sentencing, demonstrated sound progress in custody. In all the circumstances, she submitted that the aggregate head sentence and the aggregate non-parole period were open to the discretion of his Honour.

Determination

58The respondent committed a break enter and steal in company that netted $16,000 worth of drugs that could be used illicitly. Planning obviously preceded the crime, and the premises were clearly specifically targeted. The offence can be sharply contrasted with the situation where two young people snatch a DVD player worth $200 through a window that they have jemmied open.

59Three days later, the respondent shot a young man from behind having deliberately discharged a pistol that was in his possession, with the intention of inflicting really serious physical injury. Shortly before its discharge, the pistol had been pointed at the head of the victim and the respondent had made a threat to kill. At the time of the discharge of the firearm the victim was fleeing. 

60During a search conducted by police on the evening of the same day, the respondent was found to possess an entirely separate firearm that had been shortened.

61The criminal record of the respondent was not unblemished, and featured prior convictions for violence and one firearm offence. He had been imprisoned before. 

62Despite the compelling subjective aspects, and the good progress that had been made in the year or so that the respondent had been in custody, I am affirmatively satisfied that an aggregate head sentence of imprisonment for 5 years 7 months with an aggregate non-parole period of imprisonment for 4 years is manifestly inadequate. To my mind, it simply does not reflect appropriately the very substantial objective criminality of the respondent. 

63It follows that I would uphold ground three.

Discretion not to intervene

Submissions

64Senior counsel for the respondent submitted that this Court would not intervene on two bases. The first was founded on a large amount of fresh evidence placed before the Court. That included two affidavits of the respondent affirmed since the date of sentence, and an expansive report prepared by a social worker. 

65The fresh evidence demonstrated that the respondent continues to make good progress in custody and is obviously a person of significant potential. The affidavits also detail his fear of an increased sentence, and the adverse consequences that has had on his emotional well-being. 

66The report of the social worker explored in far more detail than had been done at first instance the severely deleterious effect that the suicide of both of his parents had upon the respondent during his adolescence and young adulthood. It included the fact that, after the death of his mother in 2008, the respondent sought to dull the pain of that loss by use of heroin, and quickly developed an addiction to that drug. The report revealed that the progress made by the respondent since he was sentenced in August 2011 is significant, and includes genuine progress and commitment to rehabilitation, and remaining drug free since withdrawing from the methadone program. 

67The second basis upon which it was submitted that this Court should exercise its discretion not to intervene was as follows. Senior counsel for the respondent submitted that, to the extent that the problem identified with regard to the sentence is in truth founded upon the absence of partial accumulation, then the Crown should bear some responsibility for that state of affairs. In short it was submitted that the failure of the solicitor for the Crown to re-emphasise the question of partial accumulation, after his Honour had raised an aggregate sentence as a possible option, could be relied upon by this Court to exercise the discretion not to intervene.

68The Crown did not deny that the subjective features were compelling. That included not only those that existed before sentencing, but also those that have come into focus since that time. Nevertheless, she submitted that there must be some increase in the aggregate head sentence and the aggregate non-parole period. She also resisted the proposition that the Crown had done anything at first instance that would lead to the exercise of the discretion not to intervene. 

Determination

69I do not consider that a basis has been established upon which this Court should exercise its discretion not to intervene. As I have indicated above, I consider that the aggregate head sentence and the aggregate non-parole period failed to reflect the criminality encompassed in the offences to a degree that is obvious, apparent, or plain, to use the synonyms of ""manifest"" contained in the Macquarie Dictionary. Nor do I consider that there can be any criticism made of the conduct of either lawyer in the proceedings at first instance, let alone one that could found the exercise of the discretion not to intervene. There has been no delay by the Director of Public Prosecutions in notifying or prosecuting the appeal. The adverse emotional effects on the respondent are regrettable, but cannot stand in the way of intervention in the circumstances of this case: see R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49; (2010) 199 A Crim R 486 at [95] and [141]. I consider that justice requires that this Court intervene to increase both the aggregate head sentence and the aggregate non-parole period. 

Re-sentence

70I shall not repeat all of the objective and subjective features to which I have referred. The tragic events that have marred the life of the respondent through no fault of his own, and their undoubted consequences in the development of his psychological problems, drug addiction, and criminality, must be balanced against the seriousness of his criminal acts. I fully accept that any increase in the aggregate head sentence and the aggregate non-parole period will be a bitter blow for the respondent, and may have the effect of deflecting him from the path of rehabilitation upon which he appears to be travelling. It is to be hoped that, despite this setback, he has the strength to overcome it. 

71In accordance with long-standing practice, the new sentence will be shorter than should have been imposed at first instance, on the basis of the demonstrated distress of the respondent: see Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 205 A Crim R 1 at [175]. 

72I consider that the aggregate head sentence should be increased by a period of 2 years. I consider that the aggregate non-parole period should be increased by a commensurate period of imprisonment for 18 months. In order to reflect the ratio imposed by his Honour, I would reduce that increase to the aggregate non-parole period by one month. 

73That would lead to a new aggregate head sentence of imprisonment for 7 years 7 months, with a new aggregate non-parole period of imprisonment for 5 years 5 months. 

74In accordance with the fact that the Crown did not appeal against the aggregate sentence on the basis of the indicative sentences for the first and third offences, and the fact that I do not regard the indicative sentence for the second offence as erroneous, I am content for the indicative sentences at first instance to constitute my indicative sentences with regard to the new aggregate sentence for the purpose of s 53A(2)(b) of the Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act. 

Orders

75 I propose the following orders:

(1)Crown appeal against sentence allowed.

(2)The aggregate sentence imposed by the District Court on 26 August 2011 is quashed.

(3)The respondent is re-sentenced as follows: an aggregate head sentence of imprisonment for 7 years 7 months to date from 16 July 2010 and expire on 15 February 2018 is imposed, with an aggregate non-parole period of imprisonment for 5 years 5 months to date from 16 July 2010 and expire on 15 December 2015.

		04 February 2013",2013-02-03 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2707192,R v Maglovski (No 2) [2013] NSWSC 16,"Judgment

1On 1 November 2012, Dragi Maglovski was arraigned on an indictment that charged that he, on 8 October 2011, at Hurstville in the State of New South Wales, did murder Rosa Maglovski, also known as Rosa Maglovska. Rosa Maglovska was the offender's wife. 
2To that charge the offender pleaded not guilty to murder, but guilty to manslaughter. The Crown did not accept that plea. The trial proceeded. On 12 November 2012 the jury returned a verdict of guilty to the charge of murder.

3I heard submissions and received evidence on sentence on 15 November 2012. I was due to hand down this sentence on 14 December 2012. However, as a result of the offender's ill health, the imposition of sentence was adjourned until 1 February 2013. Due to a difficulty with prison transportation the matter had to be again adjourned until today, 4 February 2013. 

4The maximum penalty for the offence of murder is life imprisonment (s 19A Crimes Act 1900). I am required to impose a life sentence if I am satisfied that the level of culpability involved in the commission of the offence was so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that form of sentence (s 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, ""the Sentencing Act""). It suffices to state that I am not satisfied that a life sentence is appropriate in this case. 

5Section 54A of the Sentencing Act specifies a standard non-parole period of twenty years for the offence of murder. In sentencing the offender I am required to be mindful of the two legislative guideposts constituted by the maximum sentence of life and that standard non-parole period (Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [27]). However, I am not required to undertake the sentencing exercise by asking whether there are reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period of twenty years (Muldrock at [25]). Instead, bearing in mind the two legislative guideposts, I am required to identify all the factors relevant to the sentencing task, consider their significance, and then assess the appropriate sentence (Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [51] per McHugh J; Muldrock at [26]).

Background 

6I will first set out certain undisputed facts concerning the offence. These are taken from the evidence at the trial.

7As at October 2011 the offender and his late wife had been married for over twenty-five years. They had lived at the same address in Hurstville for over twenty years. They had built the home on that property themselves. They lived at the home with their two adult children, Silvana now aged twenty-six, and Daniel now aged twenty-one.

8It is necessary to briefly describe the layout of the family home. The house had two separate sections. As one moved through from the front entrance towards the back of the house one passed the three main bedrooms occupied by Mrs Maglovska, Silvana Maglosvka and Daniel Maglovski into a living area and then to a kitchen at the rear. This whole floor was described in the evidence as the ""front section"". The kitchen in this section of the house was rarely used. As the topography of the house was such that the land fell away at the rear this rarely used kitchen was a storey or so above the backyard. At the back of this kitchen there were outside steps leading down to the backyard. At the bottom of the steps in the lower storey of the house is what was described in the evidence as the back section of the house. It consists of three rooms: a laundry that faces onto the backyard, a combined kitchen and living room, and a small room leading off the combined kitchen and living room that was used to store clothing.

9There was no internal connection between the back section and the front section of the house. There was also no internal connection between the laundry and the kitchen in the back section.

10For some time Mrs Maglovska and the offender shared one of the three main bedrooms in the front part of the house. About eight to nine months prior to her death the offender and Mrs Maglovska started sleeping in separate parts of the house. Mrs Maglovksa stayed in her bedroom in the front section. The offender started sleeping in the small room that led off the kitchen and living room in the back section.

11On the morning of Saturday, 8 October 2011, the offender woke at approximately 8:00am, had coffee and walked his dog. At some point during the morning Mrs Maglovska and Silvana went to inspect properties together. Silvana was intending to purchase a unit. Silvana and her mother returned before midday. Silvana prepared herself to leave again to meet a friend in the city for lunch. She left the house at some time between 12:15 to 12:30. I will refer later to her evidence as to what she observed just prior to her departure. However at the time of her departure she recalled that both her parents were in the laundry in the back section. Her brother, Daniel, was in his room in the front section listening to music.

12At 12:48pm the offender rang 000. He placed the call from a phone in the kitchen in the back section. He told the 000 operator that ""I kill my wife"" and that ""I stab her"". He said ""We were in a fight, she want a divorce"". 

13Approximately ten minutes later the first police officer arrived at the scene. He went into the front of the house and disturbed Daniel Maglovski in his bedroom. Daniel was wearing headphones. He had no idea that his mother had been killed. The officer returned to the front of the house and saw the offender standing outside. The offender was covered in blood and had a cut hand. He told that officer ""my wife, I killed her"". 

14Other police officers and an ambulance arrived at the scene. Mrs Maglovska's body was discovered in the kitchen in the back section. She was lying on her back. She had a number of stab wounds and bruising. An ambulance officer initially detected a faint pulse, but she did not survive long.

15The offender repeated his admission of killing his wife to a number of the officers at the scene. Three of the officers gave evidence during the trial. Each described the offender as being in a very calm state. The most senior of them described him as not ""showing any real emotion at all. Very cold"", and that ""he seemed very matter of fact, wasn't trying to explain things or move away. Just standing there ..."".

16The offender was transported from the scene to a nearby hospital to have the wounds to his hands attended to. Later, he was taken to Hurstville Police Station and interviewed. His interview was electronically recorded (an ""ERISP""). I describe aspects of the ERISP in more detail below, however, it suffices to state that he told the police officers of the breakdown of his marriage. He described how in the laundry that morning his wife had mentioned her desire to divorce him which had led to an exchange of words and her spitting on him. He stated how this had led to them fighting. He said that he had punched her and then stabbed her.

17A forensic pathologist, Dr Matthew Orde, performed an autopsy on the deceased. Dr Orde gave evidence at the trial. He observed a number of sharp force and blunt force injuries to her body. The blunt force injuries involved extensive bruising over her head and torso. I will not describe them all but they included bruising to the central and right side of the rear of the scalp and a ""complex lacerated defect"" on the left side of the scalp being an area where the skin had torn due to blunt force. He discovered that the deceased's nose was ""fractured or broken"" and she had a black eye on the left side of her face which had closed due to swelling of the left eyelid. In the torso region he described bruising in the shoulder and chest regions.

18With the sharp force injuries Dr Orde divided them into two sub-categories: cuts which were deeper than they were wide, which he described as stab wounds, and wounds which were more shallow than they were wide, which he said were commonly referred to as slash wounds. He observed six stab wounds to the head and sixteen slash wounds to the head and neck area. He also described four stab wounds to the torso and a number of shallow wounds on the hands which he described as ""entirely in keeping with those so-called defensive injuries"". Altogether he observed what he described as ten stab wounds and 29 slash wounds. 

19Dr Orde expressed the opinion that ""death would have been a consequence of the multiple injuries sustained by the deceased"". 

Issues at the trial and findings

20As I have stated when he was arraigned the offender pleaded guilty to manslaughter but not guilty to murder. This plea was entered on the basis that he admitted that it was his voluntary act(s) that caused the death of his wife, and that he undertook those act(s) with an intention to cause her death or inflict grievous bodily harm upon her. However, the plea put in issue whether the Crown could prove beyond reasonable doubt that he was not acting under provocation as provided for in s 23 of the Crimes Act. This issue was resolved adversely to the offender. It is necessary to outline some of the evidence at the trial in order to place the jury's verdict in context. 

21I will first address the evidence concerning the background to the events of 8 October 2011 and then the evidence concerning the killing of the deceased on that day.

22I have already referred to the family background above. The offender and Mrs Maglovska were married in Macedonia between 1982 and 1983. At the time they were married the offender was 30 and Mrs Maglovska was nineteen years old. At the time of her death Mrs Maglovska was 48 years old. Her daughter described her as an independent and ambitious woman. At least up until the time that the offender and Mrs Maglovska commenced sleeping in different rooms there was no suggestion of any violence or aggression in their marriage. The offender had no prior convictions and I directed the jury as to the use that they could make of his good character on that account in their deliberations. 

23In his evidence at the trial the offender stated that about nine months before 8 October 2011 his wife told him that she did not want to sleep with him any more because he was ""stinking"". He said that this made him feel ""extremely bad"" and ""hurt"". The evidence of Silvana and Daniel confirmed that he did start sleeping downstairs at around this time. I accept this part of the offender's evidence. 

24The offender then stated that within a few weeks of him moving to the back room his wife told him ""I can't live with you any more"". When they were arguing she said ""I don't want to sleep with you any more"" referring to their sexual relationship. He said this made him feel humiliated and ""like I don't exist any more"". I accept this evidence. 

25The deceased operated a business cleaning offices in the years prior to her death. The offender would often undertake work for the business out of hours. In order to do so the deceased would give him swipe cards to access the offices. He stated that about six weeks prior to 8 October 2011 the deceased took one of these site access cards from him. He said she told him ""You're not going to work anymore. You're too slow and I'm going to employ another man"". He said this made him feel ""very humiliated"". 

26The offender said that on the long weekend before 8 October 2011 his wife went to Canberra and Queanbeyan to work. He referred to this in his ERISP. When asked whether the deceased's attitude had changed, the offender stated that ""she wanted to be a man and I a woman"". In his evidence he said that his wife said ""I don't want you to come"" and ""I don't want you any more"" and she stayed over night. He described this as a ""great humiliation"". 

27The offender also said his wife told him that she did not need him any more. He said that if they separated he would feel embarrassed and ashamed in front of the local Macedonian community and his children. He stated that it was his belief that the Macedonian culture viewed divorce as ""very bad"".

28These events and beliefs were recounted by the offender as giving context and background to what was said to be the deceased's provocative conduct towards him on 8 October 2011. The jury's verdict does not necessarily mean that they rejected this evidence. For the purposes of sentencing I accept these matters as far as they go. While the offender no doubt found many of these events distressing, they were simply the playing out of his wife's decision to bring their marriage to an end. Over the years the dynamic of their marriage had changed as Mrs Maglovska had matured, raised her children, commenced work and established her cleaning business.

8 October 2011

29When he was asked by the Crown prosecutor why he killed his wife the offender stated:
""Because she spat in my face and she didn't want to live with me anymore. I've been working all my life for that house and all of a sudden it had to be destroyed overnight"". 

30This answer encapsulated the offender's case on provocation which the Crown had to negative. The jury were instructed that the Crown could do so if it proved beyond reasonable doubt any one of two matters. The first is that the act of the accused which caused the death of the deceased did not result, in fact, from a loss of self-control on the part of the accused that was induced or caused by some conduct on the part of the deceased (the ""first limb""; see s 23(2)(a) of the Crimes Act). The second was that the conduct of the deceased was not such that it could possibly have induced or caused an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so lost his self-control as to have formed an intention to kill the deceased or to inflict grievous bodily harm (the ""second limb""; see s 23(2)(b) of the Crimes Act).

31In addressing the first limb the offender pointed to the act of the deceased in spitting in his face as the culmination of her efforts over a period of months to humiliate him and end their marriage. The offender contended that this gave rise to the reasonable possibility of a loss of self control on his part. 

32In his evidence at the trial, the offender gave the following account about the events that occurred after Silvana and his wife returned from inspecting properties. He said that Mrs Maglovska was in the laundry and he was nearby cleaning the garden. He said they spoke in the laundry and she said something to the effect: ""I won't be doing your washing much longer"". He also said that she stated words to the effect: ""It's finished with us ..."".

33The offender said that the deceased walked out of the laundry and then through the kitchen of the back section and into the small room that runs off it. He said she was shuffling some papers. He entered the room after her. During at least part of the conversation that ensued he said ""Why are you doing this to me? We [are] supposed to be preparing weddings for our children, not to do this"".

34The offender said that the deceased then spat in his face. She said ""I don't want to live with you any more"" and ""I don't like you any more"". In answer to a question from the Crown Prosecutor the offender said that ""once she spat on me I couldn't stand it, I couldn't hold it, and the fight started"".

35The offender said that he then pushed the deceased onto the couch and was heading towards her when she kicked him in the chest, stomach and genitals. He said that this was painful and he punched her with a closed fist to the left side of her head. He said that she took a glass Coca Cola bottle and swung it, but he fended it away and it shattered on the tiled floor. He said he cut his hands trying to get the partially shattered remains of the bottle out of her hands. He said she hit and scratched him with her other hand while he was trying to get the coke bottle away from her. He said he then punched her. She fell to the floor. He punched her again.

36The offender said he then walked about 2.5m to 3m into the kitchen and grabbed a knife from the kitchen sink. He said the deceased had crawled or scrambled while bent over from the small room into the kitchen. The offender said he remembered stabbing her twice, once to her back and the other to her throat. He said he then threw the knife away and dialled 000. He walked into the laundry to wash his hands so that he could check the extent of his injuries, and then went outside to wait for the police.

37In his ERISP the offender was asked whether his wife said anything during his attack. He stated as follows:
""A And then I hit her again. And we started ...

...

Q 318 Fist?
A Fist. Everything.

Q 319 Was she saying anything?
A No. She say, 'No. Please. Don't. Don't. Don't ...'

Q 320 And then what happened? Keep talking us through what happened.
A Keep, keep, ah, keep fighting and that's it. I stab her and that's it.""

38As I have stated the offender conceded that he inflicted fatal injuries upon the deceased with the intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. I find that he intended to kill the deceased. In his ERISP he stated:
""Q 343 What did you think was going to happen when you stabbed her?
A She going to die.

Q 344 So you knew she was going to die?
...
A Yeah. Knew, I knew because we were fighting. Maybe ...

...

Q 348 And what did you think would happen to her?
A Say she will die."" 

39It is necessary to note three aspects of the offender's account which were the subject of specific contest.

40First, in cross examination the Crown prosecutor challenged the offender on whether Mrs Maglovska in fact spat on him. The offender restated that she did. He said that consistently in his ERISP and in his evidence. I am acutely conscious of the possibility that such assertions can be made safe in the knowledge that they cannot be contradicted. Nevertheless, I accept that it occurred. However, for the reasons I will explain, I do not consider that it has the significance that the offender sought to attribute to it.

41Second, I have already summarised Dr Orde's evidence concerning the bruising, fractured eye socket and number of sharp force wounds to Mrs Maglovska's body. Dr Orde identified ten stab wounds. The offender could only remember stabbing her twice, although he stated ""but I don't remember"". Counsel for the offender, Mr Spencer sought to explain the discrepancy by pointing to the shattered glass as a potential source of some of the stab wounds. Dr Orde conceded that some of Mrs Maglovska's minor injuries could have resulted from the broken glass, but said that it was ""unlikely"" that the glass caused any of the deeper stab wounds. In my view Dr Orde's evidence establishes that the offender stabbed the deceased at least ten times and beat her severely. It was a savage albeit quick attack.

42Third, Silvana Maglovska's evidence was that just prior to her leaving the house she stopped at the door at the top of the stairs when her parents were in the laundry. She states that she heard her father say ""You watch, you watch what will happen"". She said that was the first time she ever heard her father threaten her mother. The offender denied saying that. This evidence was potentially of great significance to the issue of provocation as it suggests that the offender had an aggressive state of mind in the laundry, before he was spat on. 

43Mr Spencer submitted that the jury's verdict does not necessarily mean that it accepted Silvana's evidence on this point. He contended that the jury could have found provocation was negatived because they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown had disproved the second limb of provocation; i.e. that the conduct of the deceased was not such that it could possibly have induced or caused an ordinary person, in the position of the offender, to have so lost his self-control as to have formed an intention to kill the deceased or to inflict grievous bodily harm (s 23(2)(b)). 

44I agree that it does not necessarily follow from the jury's verdict that it accepted this part of Silvana's evidence. It is nevertheless my function to determine whether it should be accepted. Mr Spencer correctly pointed out that this evidence did not appear in her first two statements which were provided on the day of the offence and 13 October 2011 respectively. It only appeared in her third statement, dated 6 September 2012.

45I heard evidence concerning the origins of the material in the third statement on a voir dire conducted during the trial. The voir dire concerned the admissibility of some other evidence sought to be adduced from Silvana Maglovska that was only revealed in that statement (R v Maglovski [2012] NSWSC 1378). Ms Maglovska stated that she was under a lot of stress at the time of her first two statements, being so close in time to the death of her mother but after that time she had received ""counselling"" and that ""I've tried to block a lot of this out. Speaking to [the counsellor] about the issue has re-jigged my memory"". Although I am conscious that Silvana Maglovska is deeply wounded by her father's actions and may have cause to give evidence adverse to him, I found this explanation convincing and her evidence compelling. I accept it.

A loss of self control?

46This leads to the question of whether the offender did in fact lose self control when he killed his wife. I have described the jury's verdict as being explicable by reference to the jury not being satisfied of the first limb of provocation, the second limb of provocation, or both. 

47I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender did not experience a loss of self control in the sense referred to in s 23(2)(a) of the Crimes Act. The offender may have suddenly risen to anger and possessed a desire to lash out as he saw his world and sense of self disappearing, but he did not lose his normal ability to reason.

48This finding is based on the following. First there is the evidence of Silvana that I have referred to above. It demonstrates that the offender's anger was roused in the laundry and he then pursued the deceased into the small room that ran off the kitchen in the back section. He became aggressive and was on the verge of becoming violent before he was spat on. 

49Second, there was the offender's conduct in walking into the kitchen area from the small room to obtain a knife, returning to the adjoining room, and then stabbing the deceased while she was reeling from his blows and scrambling into the kitchen area. The deliberation and time involved in so acting suggests he was not acting under any relevant loss of self control, although that is not determinative (see s 23(3)(b)). 

50Third, there was the composure demonstrated by the offender in immediately dialling 000 and speaking to the operator. He sounds relatively calm.

51Fourth, there is the description given by the police officers who attended at the scene and spoke to the offender. Their description of his composure is in stark contrast to the distress felt by an experienced paramedic who attended the scene.

52Fifth, there is the offender's composure and recollection in the ERISP conducted on the evening of the crime. I accept that if the offender lost his self control around 12.45pm, the effect of that loss of self control may not be evident in an ERISP that commences at 8.16pm that evening. However, during the ERISP the offender displayed an ability to recall the events surrounding his wife's death and appears to be in a similar emotional state to that suggested by the 000 call and the police descriptions of the scene.

53In the end result I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender made a deliberate decision to attack his wife. He intended to kill her. However his actions were not premeditated. His anger rose up on 8 October 2011 after she made it clear that their marriage was over and he realised she was determined to finally leave. After he started attacking her he had the ability to stop, but instead stabbed her while she begged him to stop.

Victim impact statement

54Silvana Maglovska delivered a victim impact statement. She described how her and her brother's lives had changed in an instant without warning following their mother's death. She is consumed by unanswerable questions as to how this crime could have happened, why her father did not stop before it was too late, and whether her mother's death would have been avoided if she had taken her mother to lunch with her on that fateful day. She describes how, in the immediate aftermath of the incident, she and her brother were left the task of organising their mother's funeral. They chose not to have an open coffin due to the injuries to their mother's face. Her sense of loss is indescribably profound:
""Mum was supposed to help me, help me plan for my wedding, help me purchase my first home, help me raise my kids but instead I am all alone.""

55Silvana Maglovska's statement painted a vivid image of her and her brother lost and in pain as a consequence of the destruction of their family and all of the happy memories associated with it.

56The significance of victim impact statements was discussed in MAH v R [2006] NSWCCA 226 at [61] to [63]. I do not treat them as evidence which I can act on, or material which operates in aggravation of the offence, or material that could be used otherwise adversely to the offender. That said, the Court acknowledges the deep suffering caused to Silvana and Daniel as a result of the offender's conduct. 

The offender's personal history

57Tendered on sentencing was a report from a forensic psychologist, Ms Anna Robilliard. Ms Robilliard concluded that the offender does not suffer from any psychiatric or psychological injury. Her report conveniently sets out aspects of the offender's personal history which are consistent with the evidence led at the trial.

58The offender is now sixty years old. He was born in a small village in Macedonia in 1952. He was the youngest in a family of four boys and three girls. His sister is seventy-five years old and lives in Australia. The remainder of his surviving siblings live in Macedonia. His parents are both deceased. Ms Robilliard describes him as having grown up in a close-knit, stable family in which he was never exposed to violence, neglect or abuse. Religious gatherings were said to be an important part of family and village life.

59The offender completed his secondary schooling at fifteen or sixteen years of age. He had repeated one year to that time. After finishing schooling, he commenced an apprenticeship as a carpenter. When he was twenty-two, the offender was sponsored to come to Australia by his older sister. He lived with her and her family in Sydney for about seven years. He found work in various factories. In his late twenties he returned to Macedonia because his mother was ill. She died soon after he arrived. At that time he met the deceased, and he remained in Macedonia for two years while they courted and married. As I have stated, his wife was nineteen years old when they were married, and the offender was aged thirty. They returned to live in Australia in 1984.

60Silvana was born in 1985. Two or three years after her birth the offender and the deceased bought their home in Hurstville. Daniel was born in 1991. Some years later the offender and his wife demolished their Hurstville home and built a new house on the property. 

61The offender has worked with the same carpentry firm making cabinets, office furniture and kitchens since the 1980s. On weekends he also did carpentry work based on recommendations from friends. The deceased worked as a cleaner, and at some point established her own cleaning business, which sub-contracted to other cleaning companies. The offender would assist her with the cleaning jobs after he finished work at night. 

62In his evidence at the trial the offender described his and his wife's social life as centred upon activities with other families in the local Macedonian community.

63I have described the background to the offence above. There is nothing to suggest that there was any substantial marital disharmony until the last year of Mrs Maglovska's life. There was no suggestion from either of their children or any other witness that prior to this deterioration there had been any aggression or violence in their relationship.

64As I stated earlier, the offender has never been convicted of an offence. 

65Ms Robilliard did not identify any psychiatric or psychological illness or disorder on the part of the offender. She also noted that he did not report any particular difficulties with incarceration and stated that he was likely to continue to adopt a ""quiet and socially isolated place in the prison community"".

66In relation to his remorse and prospects of rehabilitation, Ms Robilliard stated as follows:
""It seems he had no mechanisms for releasing tension within the relationship and endeavoured to contain and control his emotional hurt and pain.

...

During our meeting he expressed apparently sincere regret and remorse over the death of his wife stating he still loves her.

...

This man has no history of anti-social behaviour or of violent behaviour nor did he give a history of excessive substance abuse which might contribute to loss of behavioural control. The incident in question occurred in the context of a very long term, intimate relationship which underwent marked changes that affected the [offender] deeply. His cultural perspectives and expectations made the dynamics of the changed relationship between himself and his wife acutely painful and emotionally distressing and Mr Maglovski appeared to lack strategies for releasing stress and tension or ways of addressing differences and conflict in his marriage. His capacity to control his strong emotional responses to their changed circumstances was overcome by small but highly significant incidents which occurred between them on the morning of 8 October 2011. The cumulative impact precipitated a sudden and violent outburst by the [offender] which was unprecedented in the history of his marital relationship. His expressions of regret and remorse appear to be sincere and genuine. The likelihood of a similar set of circumstances reoccurring appears to be negligible.""

67I consider the questions of remorse and the offender's prospects of re-offending below. At this point I note three matters about this analysis.

68First, I do not take Ms Robilliard's reference to a ""sudden and violent outburst"" as expressing an opinion one way or another as to whether the conduct of the offender involved a ""loss of self control"" within the meaning of s 23(2)(a) of the Crimes Act. I have already found that there was no such loss of self control, however, that finding is not inconsistent with Ms Robilliard's description. In my view, it is an accurate one.

69Second, Ms Robilliard's description of the position the offender found himself in and how that eventually contributed to his offending is persuasive. As I have stated at the time the offender married his wife he was thirty and she was nineteen. It can be expected that her comparative youth at the time, coupled with her arrival in a foreign country, would lead to her being significantly dependant upon her husband. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that Mrs Maglovska was an extremely resourceful woman. Over time, her position and the nature of their relationship changed dramatically as she became more independent. Ms Robilliard's description of the offender as someone who had no mechanisms for addressing the difficulties in their relationship strikes me as persuasive. The offender was simply ill-equipped to deal with the changing nature of his relationship with his wife, and could not accept the exercise by her of her right to determine a future without him.

70Third, Ms Robilliard refers to his ""cultural perspectives and expectations"". In his evidence at the trial the offender stated that if he and his wife separated he would feel embarrassed and ashamed in front of the local Macedonian community and his children. As I have said, he gave evidence that it was his belief that the Macedonian culture viewed divorce as ""very bad"". He told Ms Robilliard that their divorce would not only humiliate him, but also reflect poorly on the children. This evidence assists in placing the offender's emotional state in context in order to understand how the events of 8 October 2011 transpired. It stands in contrast to the sociological material that was tendered on sentence which I address next. 

The sociological evidence

71Also tendered on the hearing was a report from a professor of sociology from the University of Sydney, Michael Humphrey, entitled ""Honour Killing and Macedonian Cultural Background"". Under the heading ""Macedonian Culture and Gender"", the author states:
""Macedonia remains a traditional and patriarchal culture. Indicators such as a high level of domestic violence and very low divorce rate suggest the persistence of very conservative gender roles. High levels of domestic violence indicate that men continue to rule households and the State does not intervene in domestic disputes. The divorce rate of 5% of marriages in Macedonia is very low by international standards - e.g. around 33% in Australia and more than 50% in some Western European countries. This low divorce rate indicates women remain within marriages and are unable to leave, even if there is domestic violence.

Macedonian society, like the Balkans in general, remains patriarchal in which men hold authority and have responsibility for providing for the family. ... Women in particular are made to carry the burden of honour in their moral behaviour. Across Mediterranean cultures this is referred to as the honour code. Where women's behaviour - imagined or real - is publicly seen to shame or humiliate the family and to the head of the household honour killing is an institution which is culturally understood as a way to ritually cleanse the family of the shame."" (emphasis added)

72Taken at face value, this last statement might be seen as conveying an assertion that there is a ""cultural understanding"" in Macedonia that some form of behaviour by women necessitates a ritual cleansing of ""the family of the shame"" of their conduct in the form of domestic homicide.

73An opinion of this kind is likely to create much heat but shed very little light in sentencing proceedings. In any event, it has a number of difficulties. The existence of high levels of domestic violence within a society accompanied by apparent State inaction may justify a well founded fear of persecution on the part of a woman sufficient to establish refugee status (Minister for Immigration v Khawar [2002] HCA 14; 210 CLR 1). However that falls a long a way short of demonstrating a cultural understanding of wife killing as a form of ritual cleansing. Even if such a matter was established, it would be highly unlikely to assist any offender in the assessment of the appropriate sentence in this country for an offence of murder. If the offender shared that cultural understanding and it was said to be operative upon the offender at the time of the commission of an offence, then considerations of both general and specific deterrence would suggest that a much longer, not shorter, sentence would be warranted. It is noteworthy that in this case the offender did not assert any such understanding. He did not assert that he carried out any ""honour killing"" or shared some similar type of cultural understanding which was operative upon him when he killed his wife.

74In any event, it is not necessary to consider this further. At the outset of his report when describing his qualifications Professor Humphrey states as follows:
""The anthropological opinion about honour killing presented in this report is not based on detailed ethnographic research in Macedonia or the Macedonian immigrant community in Australia. It is based on extensive knowledge about honour killing as an institution practised across diverse cultures, especially in the Mediterranean. The countries I have undertaken field research in relation to political and family violence include Australia, Bosnia, Lebanon, Jordan, Pakistan, South Africa and Argentina. I have special knowledge of Muslim cultures and have undertaken field research on Lebanese Muslims in Australia with a focus on family conflict and homicides including honour killing."" (emphasis added)

75This level of expertise and study does not justify the expression of an opinion of such a severe nature concerning Macedonia. Only one of the areas that he has studied is near Macedonia, namely Bosnia. Exactly what other countries or areas in the Mediterranean besides Lebanon justified the conclusion drawn were not identified. If they were, the conclusion may well come as a surprise to their inhabitants. 

76The balance of Professor Humphrey's report addresses what was stated by the offender in his record of interview. The report expresses opinions about the likely level of perceived insult which would have flowed from the conduct of the deceased, especially her statements as to the ending of the marriage and her act of spitting. Sociological evidence as to the severity of the nature of a provocative act might be of some assistance in explaining to an Australian Court the gravity of the insult to a person of a different culture which might otherwise seem innocuous (see Stingel v R [1990] HCA 61; 171 CLR 312, 327). However, in light of the jury's verdict and my findings, it is unnecessary to consider this further.

Aggravating and mitigating factors

77Both the Crown and Mr Spencer addressed me on the presence or absence of the aggravating factors listed in s 21A(2) of the Sentencing Act and the mitigating factors listed in s 21A(3). The only potentially aggravating factor referred to by the Crown was that specified in s 21A(2)(eb), namely that the offence was committed in the home of the victim. Nevertheless, the Crown accepted that s 21A(2)(eb) was not directed to the form of extreme domestic violence addressed in this case, but was more concerned with invasions of the sanctity of the home by third parties.

78Mr Spencer referred me to a number of mitigating factors specified in s 21A(3). First he contended that the offence was clearly not part of a planned or organised criminal activity (s 21A(3)(b)). I accept that is so. This was not a premeditated killing.

79Second, Mr Spencer submitted that his client was ""provoked by the victim"" for the purposes of s 21A(3)(c). In particular, he contended that even though the jury had not returned a verdict of manslaughter on the basis of provocation, that did not preclude a finding that some conduct on the part of Mrs Maglovska materially contributed to the commission of the offence. 

80I accept that s 21A(3)(c) can be satisfied even in a case where jury has been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown has negatived a defence of provocation under s 23 of the Crimes Act. For example, the basis for the jury's rejection of the defence of provocation may be that it found that the offender experienced a loss of self control due to some insulting behaviour of the deceased, but nevertheless was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that an ordinary person in the position of the offender could not have formed the intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm; i.e. the jury may have rejected the so called second limb of the defence of provocation referred to in s 23(2)(b) of the Crimes Act. 

81However, the conduct of the victim which prompted the offence must, at the very least, be something in the nature of insulting or infuriating behaviour so that it could truly be described as provocative. In this case the act of the deceased in spitting on the offender could answer that description. However it follows from my earlier findings that the precipitating cause of the attack preceded that act and was concerned with her confirmation that their marriage was over. The free choice by the deceased to exercise her undoubted right to leave her marriage could never by itself meet the definition of provocative behaviour on any relevant standard. It is not a mitigating circumstance for a husband who either kills or assaults their spouse that their actions were a response to being advised by their spouse of a decision to end their relationship. I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the mitigating factor in s 21A(3)(c)(i) is established.

82Mr Spencer submitted that the mitigating factor identified in s 21A(3)(e) was made out, namely that the offender does not have any record of previous convictions. This is clearly correct. He also refers to s 21A(3)(f), namely that the offender was a person of good character. I also accept that factor is established.

83Mr Spencer also referred to the related mitigating factors in s 21A(3)(g) and (h), namely that the offender is unlikely to re-offend and has good prospects of rehabilitation whether by reason of his age or otherwise. In this case, I am satisfied that there is almost no chance of the offender re-offending. Until the breakdown of his marriage, he was a person who had lived an exemplary life. As I have stated, there was no suggestion of any violent behaviour within the marriage prior to its breakdown. The terrible events that led to his being before the Court arose out of the collapse, as he saw it, of his family to which he had devoted himself throughout his life. He is now aged sixty and will receive a substantial custodial sentence. He has destroyed his family and will not have an opportunity to establish or take part in another.

84Mr Spencer also referred to the conduct of the offender after the offence, in that he immediately telephoned the police to inform them of what he had done and he participated in the ERISP. Mr Spencer also pointed to the manner in which the trial was conducted on his behalf, namely by narrowing the issues to only provocation and the full acceptance by him that the other elements of the offence of murder were established. 

85Subsection 21A(3)(l) specifies that a mitigating factor is ""the degree of pre-trial disclosure by the defence (as provided by s 22A)"". Section 22A provides:
""Power to reduce penalties for facilitating the administration of justice

(1) A court may impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise impose on an offender who was tried on indictment having regard to the degree to which the administration of justice has been facilitated by the defence (whether by disclosures made pre-trial or during the trial or otherwise).

(2) A lesser penalty that is imposed under this section in relation to an offence must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.""

86I have already referred to the admission made by the offender at the scene and in his ERISP. Prior to the trial, I listed this matter for two directions hearings. On the second directions hearing, Mr Spencer advised the Court that the sole issue to be raised in the trial would be provocation. As I stated, when he was arraigned the offender entered a plea of not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter. Thus, from an early point of the trial the offender indicated that the other elements of the offence of murder would not be put in issue. The only issue in the trial was whether the Crown could negative provocation. By the usual standards of the lengths of the murder trials in this Court, the trial was relatively brief. In my view, the offender is entitled to some leniency by reason of the approach that was taken by him both prior to his trial and during it.

87Mr Spencer submits that his client has shown remorse. He referred me to s 21A(3)(i) which provides:
""(i) the remorse shown by the offender for the offence, but only if:

(i) the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions, and

(ii) the offender has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions or made reparation for such injury, loss or damage (or both) ...""

88I have found this aspect of the sentencing process difficult. My viewing of the offender's ERISP recorded on the evening of the killing does not reveal him showing any remorse. It may be his natural disposition, but he appeared to be calm and collected in his description of what had happened. During the trial his behaviour was exemplary although it was clear that he was under much greater emotional stress than he appeared to be on the night that he killed his wife. However, it is not clear whether this involved any appreciation or regret for his actions, or whether it was directed to sorrow at his own circumstances and the shame he is suffering. He did not address this issue in his evidence before the jury and he did not give any further evidence on sentencing. 

89The question of remorse is addressed in Ms Robilliard's report, and I have set out the relevant extracts above. With some hesitation, I am prepared to accept that he is now regretful and remorseful for killing his wife, although he also sees himself as the victim of her desire to leave the marriage.

90It was not submitted that any reduction in sentence on account of the offender's age was warranted. In any event, the authorities binding on me make it clear that I cannot reduce the otherwise appropriate term of imprisonment to be served simply on the basis that it is likely to extend to most of the offender's remaining life expectancy (Goebel-McGregor v R [2006] NSWCCA 390 at [128] per James J, with whom Hidden and Hislop JJ agreed; Barton v R [2009] NSWCCA 164).

91In the end, I am required to sentence a man who violently killed his wife because he could not cope with her decision to leave him. Her death was violent, but unplanned. She was slain in her own home after spending the morning with her daughter and with her son nearby, both innocent in every sense of the word. Until the breakdown of his marriage the offender had lived an exemplary life and still had much to look forward to, even if his marriage had not survived. In this case considerations of general deterrence and the need for the sentence to reflect notions of retribution and denunciation are highly significant. Married women have the right to choose their own destiny. Significant punishments will be imposed upon those who inflict violence on them for exercising that right. That said the offender does not represent a danger to society and his imprisonment is not necessary for its protection.

92The offender has visited misery upon himself. I expect that as he contemplates what he had and what he has lost he will consider prison to be only a small part of the punishment he is enduring. 

93As I noted in R v Shee [2012] NSWSC 1422 at [46], following the decision in Muldrock, there is some doubt about whether sentencing courts are required or permitted to make an assessment of whether an offence in respect of which there is a standard non-parole period is in the low, middle or high range of objective seriousness (see R v Koloamatangi [2011] NSWCCA 288 at [19] per Basten JA, Adams and Johnson JJ agreeing). If I am required to make that assessment then it suffices to state that the objective features of this offence that I have outlined satisfy me that it falls below the middle of the range of objective seriousness for the offence of murder (cf s 54A(2) of the Sentencing Act).

94It was common ground that any term of imprisonment should commence from 8 October 2011. 

The sentence

95Dragi Maglovski, for the offence involving the murder of Rosa Maglosvka you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment.

2707197,Piscitelli v R [2013] NSWCCA 8,"Judgment

1Hoeben JA: I agree with Button J.

2Johnson J: I agree with Button J.

3Button J: On 14 February 2011 in the District Court at Wollongong, his Honour Judge Frearson SC sentenced Tony Dominic Piscitelli (""the applicant"") for four offences. Three appeared on an indictment and one was placed before his Honour on a certificate pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. All offences were of a sexual nature, and all of them arose from one incident on the evening of 13 April 2010.

4The details of the offences and the structure of the sentences imposed will be provided later in this judgment. It suffices to say at this stage that a total head sentence of imprisonment for 16 years 6 months with a total non-parole period of imprisonment for 11 years 6 months was imposed with regard to the four offences.

The offences

5The following summary is taken from the remarks on sentence. No ground of appeal impugns these findings of fact:

""Now the facts are that the victim, an eighty-three year old widow resided alone at her home at Tuross Boulevard, Tuross Heads and the victim's residence is a small two bedroom unit contained in a small complex of three units. Her unit is located at the front of the property facing the street. She lived at the address for some eight years. The victim suffered from asthma and takes various forms of Ventolin to relieve her condition. On Tuesday 13 April 2010 the victim spent the evening alone watching television in the lounge room of her unit which is situated at the front of the unit. The front screen door was locked. During the evening she changed into her sleeping attire, namely a nightie, dressing gown, underpants and socks. It was about 9pm that the victim left the lounge room with a torch and entered the bathroom at the rear of the unit to use the toilet. She used the torch apparently to save on electricity. She went to the bathroom in darkness and at the same time the accused entered the unit, the facts say by cutting the flyscreen. There is a dispute about the precise method of entry, and unlatching the screen door. The victim did not turn the light on in the bathroom and the only light in the unit at that time came from the torch and the single light which had been left on in the lounge room. As the victim seated herself on the toilet the offender, who unbeknown to her had entered the bathroom, placed a hand over her mouth and throat and applied pressure. The victim attempted to push the hand away from her mouth and throat at which time she heard the offender say, ""Don't make a noise, I'm not going to hurt you"". She attempted to struggle against the accused but was unable to free herself of his grasp and it was very dark and she could only see a body towering over her. The offender grabbed the victim by the upper left arm and pulled her off the toilet. The offender continued to say to the victim, ""I'm not going to hurt you, I'm not going to hurt you"".

The offender took the victim from the bathroom and pulled her towards the bedroom causing pain to her arm and during this time the victim pleaded with the accused saying, ""Please don't do this, please don't do this"". The offender pulled the victim into the bedroom, the room was in darkness and the offender said, ""Take the dressing gown off"". The victim was very scared and she complied. The accused said, ""Take your nightie off"", and the victim complied and the offender said, ""Take your pants off"", and she again complied. The victim did not argue and did fight against the offender but continued to plead with him stating, ""Please don't do this, please don't do this"". The offender ignored the victim's pleas and said, ""Lay on the bed on your stomach"". The victim did as she was told and the offender immediately attempted to penetrate her vagina with his penis without success and the victim actually felt the penis press against her anus. The offender made three or four attempts to penetrate the victim before inserting his fingers into her vagina and the accused moved his fingers around inside the victim's vagina and that is the activity that constitutes count 1.

After a short time the offender removed his fingers from the victim's vagina and he was breathing heavily at this time. The victim was struggling to breathe and she felt disgusted and humiliated as one would expect. The accused then said, ""Get up and lay on your back"", and the victim stood up from the bed and turned around before lying on her back on the bed with her knees on the bed and her legs dangling over the side. The offender penetrated the victim's vagina with his penis from a standing position and commenced to engage in penile/vaginal intercourse with her. That is the activity that founds count 2.

While this was occurring the offender placed his mouth on the victim's right breast, and this is the matter that is the indecent assault that founds the matter on the 166 certificate. The offender placed his face against her right cheek, the victim turned her head to the left in an attempt to move away from the offender and the offender stopped and said to the victim, ""I've got a knife"". She did not see a knife. He continued to have penile/vaginal sexual intercourse with the victim and the offender placed his arms around her in an embrace and demanded that she do the same. That seems rather odd. The victim, fearing for her life, did as the offender insisted. The offender became agitated and asked the victim if she was enjoying the sexual activity and the victim stated unsurprisingly, ""I'm 83 years old what do you expect"". The offender persisted in having penile/vaginal intercourse with the victim and ejaculated a short time later and the victim stated that the accused was pushing harder and faster prior to ejaculating causing her pain. She was struggling for breath and could feel her heart palpitating. The intercourse occurred for about three minutes.

The offender said, ""Stand up, sit down and put your back up against the wall"". The victim stood up from the bed and sat down on the floor in a small place between the dressing table and the bedroom door with her back against the brick wall. The offender forcefully took hold of the victim's head with both of his hands on either side of her face. He brought the victim's head forwards towards him and immediately forced it backwards causing the rear of her head to strike against an internal brick wall. He repeated this at least four or five times. This is the activity that is said to have resulted in the wounding that is the specially aggravating feature of the attempted sexual intercourse which I referred to before. The blows caused a loud cracking noise and the victim had tears in her eyes and felt intense pain. The offender stopped and the victim was able to get back onto the bed and she was having great difficult breathing and was suffering extreme pain to her head.

The offender was standing in front of her. She said, ""I need my puffer I can't breathe"", and the offender said, ""Where is your puffer"", and the victim replied, ""It's out on the kitchen table"", the offender said, ""I'll go and get it"", and he left the bedroom and the victim could see the silhouette of a tall thin man possibly wearing a checked shirt. The victim saw the offender turn towards the lounge room and took the opportunity to quickly replace her underpants, nightie and dressing gown. The victim then sat on the bed and waited for the accused to return with the puffer. He did not return. After a short time the victim left the bedroom and commenced to check all the rooms in her unit to determine whether the accused was still present. When she checked the laundry she saw that the back door was ajar. The victim closed and locked the door before entering the lounge room. The victim did not sight the offender and assumed him to have left the unit. She noticed that her puffer was where she had left it on the kitchen table. The victim sat in the lounge room and administered her puffer to assist her breathing. The victim saw that the front door to the premises was closed but not locked. She locked this door and returned to her chair. She feared calling the police and she was concerned the accused may still be nearby. About six to seven minutes after sitting in the chair the victim contacted a neighbour and the victim initially told the neighbour that there was an intruder in the home and she was in a mess. The neighbour contacted police with her husband and the neighbour and her husband attended the victim's unit. The victim was initially frightened to open the door when the neighbours arrived but ultimately she summoned the courage to let them in and they saw that the victim was covered in blood and she said, ""I've been raped"". One of the neighbours, Lynette Norton, called the police and ambulance and the victim was crying at this stage. Police and ambulance attended the victim's premises.""

6The profound gravity of the criminality encompassed by the offences committed by the applicant requires no elaboration by me. His Honour found that the offences were ""just below worst case"".

The aftermath of the offences

7As a result of the offences, the victim suffered extensive bruising to most of her body. There were also injuries to her genitals. There were a number of lacerations to various parts of her body, the most serious of which was a laceration to her right temple that required seven sutures. She remained in hospital for a period of 11 days. A number of black and white photos before this Court go some way to showing the injuries inflicted upon the victim. 

8A victim impact statement was read out in the proceedings on sentence. The victim described the impact of the offences upon her as ""huge"". She described flashbacks and memories that led her to ""shudder with revulsion"". She experienced nightmares and was being treated for depression as at the date of that statement. She was hypervigilant.

9The victim found it impossible to remain in the flat where the offences had been committed. She moved in with her daughter for three months and then with her son for two months. She found a new home away from Tuross Heads. She did not feel comfortable driving at her new home, and had lost a substantial degree of independence as a result.

10The victim revealed in the statement that, prior to the offences, the only person with whom she had had sexual contact in her life was her deceased husband.

11The victim impact statement concluded by saying that the victim believed on the evening in question that she would not survive her ordeal.

The position of the applicant after the offences

12A male DNA profile was obtained from the underwear of the victim. That profile was very promptly compared to a database, and it was found to be identical to the profile of the applicant on that database. The applicant was living in Tuross Heads at the time. On 19 April 2010 he was interviewed at length by the police, and flatly denied the offences. He was arrested and charged, and has been in custody ever since that date. 

13On 21 April 2010, his mother visited the applicant at the police station and asked him about the offences. His Honour found in the remarks on sentence that:

""[S]he asked him why he did it and according to the mother the offender replied, ""I don't know, I don't remember mum, I remember going to the house and seeing her watching TV, the door was open but the screen door was locked. I cut the flyscreen and reached in and unlocked the latch"". The offender stated, ""I don't think she saw me because it was dark"". He told his mother he could not remember anything else. On 22 April 2010 the accused's mother provided a statement to the police about those admissions.""

14In a further ERISP on 4 May 2010, the applicant did not deny the offences, but claimed to have no memory of them. He also claimed to have no memory of the conversation with his mother, or indeed of the first ERISP. With regard to his amnesia regarding the offences, he referred to the fact that he had been intoxicated that evening by alcohol, cannabis, and some prescription medication provided to him by another person. 

15The applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court and was committed for sentence (I infer that, for some procedural reason, an indictment was presented in the District Court). He received a 25 per cent discount as a result of the utilitarian value of his pleas. Neither party impugned the quantum of that discount in this Court. 

16Whilst in custody, the applicant wrote a letter to the victim expressing his embarrassment, shame, and remorse for what he had done. That letter was tendered in the proceedings on sentence. 

Subjective features generally

17No psychological, psychiatric, or pre-sentence report was available to his Honour in the proceedings on sentence. The applicant gave evidence on oath, as did his mother.

18The applicant was born on 10 July 1986. Accordingly, as at the date of the offence, he was 23 years old. As at the date of sentence, he was 24 years old.

19The applicant was raised by his mother on her own and had few, if any, positive male role models in his life. He was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder at the age of 9 years, and took medication for that condition until he was aged 15. He was exposed to illicit drugs at the age of 10. He had left school in year nine and had worked in a number of short-term, unskilled positions. At the time of these offences, he was unemployed and living with his mother in Tuross Heads. 

20There was no evidence of his level of intellectual functioning, but the impression one gains from the transcript of the ERISPs and his evidence on oath is that he is, at the least, an unsophisticated person.

21The criminal record of the applicant was not unblemished and did not assist him. It commences in the Children's Court with a charge when he was 12 years of age. It features offences of dishonesty, damage to property, and some violence, with resultant probation periods and short control orders, some suspended and some to be served in custody. As an adult in NSW, he had been convicted of malicious damage (for which he had been fined $100), and driving offences. 

22In Queensland, he had been dealt with as an adult for a number of offences relating to drug possession and use, misuse of a carriage service, and dishonesty. 

23His criminal record as a whole, whilst lengthy, revealed that the applicant had never been sentenced to imprisonment in an adult gaol. 

24Of particular note were two offences dealt with in the Children's Court in 2003. The facts with regard to each of those offences were tendered in the proceedings on sentence. The details of those two offences are as follows. 

25The applicant was dealt with for assaulting a school student in April 2003 whilst she was attending school. The facts were that an 8 year old girl entered the girls' toilet block of the public school she was attending. There she was grabbed around the mouth by the applicant. He told her to be quiet and said ""I have a friend here"". The victim escaped from the applicant, ran back to her class, and told her teacher what had happened. 

26The applicant was sentenced to a control order with a very short non-parole period. Of note was that one of the conditions of his release was that he was ""to participate in assessment and intervention as directed by the sex offender program"" and ""not to associate with children under the age of 12 years unless approved by the sex offender program"". 

27In August of the same year, the applicant committed an offence of peeping or prying. 

28The facts were that one morning a 16 year old girl went to use the female toilets at a TAFE in North Wollongong. There were two cubicles in the toilets, and the victim noted that one of the cubicles had its door closed. She went to the other cubicle, locked the door, and commenced to take off her jeans. At that time she heard a noise from the other cubicle, looked up, and saw the applicant looking at her over the top of the cubicle wall. She became frightened and ran out of the toilet. 

29For that offence, the applicant received a further control order with a non-parole period of 2 months. Again, included in the orders were the conditions that the applicant involve himself as directed with the sex offender program, and not associate with children under the age of 12 years unless authorised to do so. 

30The significance of these two matters will be discussed further below.

31It was shown in the proceedings on sentence that the applicant would serve any sentences on protection, though the evidence as to the degree of restriction resulting from that fact was quite limited.

32As for the future, both the applicant and his mother accepted that treatment for his undoubted sexual problems was essential.

33The findings of his Honour with regard to the future included that prospects of rehabilitation were ""extremely guarded"", and that there was a ""real danger that the offender will reoffend"". Those findings are not the subject of criticism by the applicant.

Two findings in the remarks on sentence

34Two factual findings made by his Honour found grounds of appeal in this Court.

35The first was with regard to the offence committed in April 2003 described above. There was a dispute at first instance as to whether his Honour could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that that offence had a sexual component. There was no dispute that the later offence of August 2003 could be so characterised. After reviewing the facts of the two matters, his Honour said in the remarks on sentence:

""These matters are relevant on the question of whether the offender has unresolved sexual issues and I will come back to that later. It is submitted on his behalf that the August 2003 incident [sic] does not have a sexual connotation. I am satisfied that it does and I am satisfied of that beyond reasonable doubt.""

36There was also a dispute at first instance whether one could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant intended to sexually assault the victim at the time when he entered the home, or whether his Honour should proceed on the basis that the applicant formed that intention sometime after entry. His Honour said:

""In relation to the facts I do find, and I find it beyond reasonable doubt, that the offender actually entered the premises with a view to the sexual exploitation of the victim. There is a close temporal connection between his entry into the premises and what he did and his evidence that he entered thinking something was wrong is inherently implausible and I find it unbelievable and I reject it beyond reasonable doubt.""

Sentences imposed

37Annexed to this judgment is a diagram that seeks to show the structure of the sentences imposed upon the applicant in a readily comprehensible format. 

38I shall discuss the sentences chronologically, in the sense that I deal with them in the order of their commencement dates.

39Count 3 was an offence of breaking and entering and committing a serious indictable offence (attempted sexual intercourse without consent) in circumstances of special aggravation, namely, wounding. The offence was brought pursuant to s 112(3) of the Crimes Act 1900. It was founded on the applicant opening the flyscreen door, entering into the dwelling of the victim, and thereafter unsuccessfully attempting to penetrate the genitalia of the victim with his penis. This offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years, and a standard non-parole period of imprisonment for 7 years. His Honour imposed a head sentence of 10 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 6 years 6 months, both to commence on 19 April 2010. The head sentence expires on 18 October 2020, and the non-parole period expires on 18 October 2016.

40There was an indecent assault contained on the s 166 certificate. It was founded on the touching of the breast of the victim. The offence was brought pursuant to s 61L of the Crimes Act. The maximum penalty for that offence when dealt with on indictment is imprisonment for 5 years. There is no standard non-parole period applicable. When dealt with summarily, the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 2 years. 

41His Honour imposed a fixed term of imprisonment for 2 years, to commence on 19 April 2010 and expire on 18 April 2012. It can be seen that that fixed term is completely concurrent with the sentence imposed on count 3. No challenge was made to this sentence, and it need not be discussed further. 

42Count 1 was an offence of aggravated sexual intercourse, the circumstance of aggravation being the infliction of actual bodily harm. The form of sexual intercourse relied upon to found this count was penetration of the vagina of the victim by the fingers of the applicant. The offence was brought pursuant to s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act. The maximum penalty was imprisonment for a period of 20 years, with a standard non-parole period of imprisonment for 10 years. His Honour imposed a head sentence of imprisonment for 12 years, to commence on 19 October 2011 and expire on 18 October 2023. A non-parole period of imprisonment for 7 years 6 months was imposed, to commence on 19 October 2011 and expire on 18 April 2019. 

43Count 2 was in identical terms. The form of sexual intercourse underpinning this count was penetration of the vagina of the victim by the penis of the applicant. A head sentence of imprisonment for 13 years to commence on 19 October 2013 and expire on 18 October 2026 was imposed, with a non-parole period of imprisonment for 8 years to commence on 19 October 2013 and expire on 18 October 2021.

44As noted above, the ultimate result is a total head sentence of imprisonment for 16 years 6 months, with a total non-parole period of 11 years 6 months. 

GROUNDS

45Six grounds of appeal have been notified. I shall deal with them in turn. 

Ground One
""The learned sentencing judge failed to give appropriate weight to the applicant's contrition""

Background and submissions

46No written or oral submissions were made by senior counsel for the applicant in support of this ground. 

47The background is that, in the remarks on sentence, his Honour said:

""On the question of remorse I accept that the offender has acknowledged the gravity of his behaviour and I do accept that he is remorseful and I do accept that he has accepted responsibility for his behaviour. And I do accept that he is ashamed of his behaviour.""

Decision

48In light of the position of senior counsel for the applicant, I consider that I can deal with this ground briefly. 

49In light of that extract from the remarks on sentence, it is not possible to say that his Honour failed to take into account this topic, or made a wrong finding about it, or even an ungenerous finding about it. As for whether his Honour gave the matter appropriate weight, that surely calls for evaluation of the ultimate sentences, both individually and in their total effect: see my remarks in Hanania v R [2012] NSWCCA 220, with whom Hoeben JA and Johnson J agreed. I proceed to consider the question of whether the sentences appropriately reflect the contrition that was found to exist when I come to ground six. 

50Accordingly, I do not uphold ground one as a separate ground.

Ground Two
""The learned sentencing judge fell into error in his treatment of the applicant's criminal history""

Background and submissions

51Senior counsel for the applicant submitted that it was not reasonably open to find that the offence in April 2003 (that is, the offence of assaulting the 8 year old girl in the toilet block by placing his hand over her mouth and holding her) had a sexual component. It was submitted that that finding was of some importance, because it played a role in the proposition that the applicant had longstanding sexual problems and that, as a result, his prospects of rehabilitation were extremely guarded. Senior counsel for the applicant referred to the portion of the remarks on sentence extracted by me above at [35], and submitted that there must have been some confusion about the topic. That was because defence counsel at first instance had never submitted that the incident in August 2003 did not have a sexual flavour. Rather, it was the characterisation of the earlier offence in April 2003 that was the point of contention in the Court below.

52Counsel for the respondent submitted that the reference to August, as opposed to April, in the extracted portion of the remarks on sentence was nothing more than a slip of the tongue. 

53As for whether it was reasonably open to find that the offence in April 2003 had a sexual connotation, she made a number of submissions. First, all three victims were females. Secondly, the applicant accepted in the witness box that, in 2003, his problem with females had manifested itself. Thirdly, he also gave evidence that he had realised in that same year that he had issues relating to violence with females. Fourthly, the criminal record of the applicant revealed that, with regard to the April 2003 offence, he had been ordered to be involved in a sex offender program. Fifthly and finally, she emphasised that all three offences were committed in toilets, two public and one private.

Decision

54The limitations on review by this Court of findings fact made by a sentencing judge at first instance are well known and established by such cases as R v O'Donoghue (1988) 34 A Crim R 397, R v Kelly (1993) 30 NSWLR 64, and Aoun v R [2011] NSWCCA 284. In short, a finding of fact will not found the basis of a successful ground unless that finding was ""not reasonably open"". 

55In light of all of the aspects of the evidence discussed above, I consider that the finding of fact under consideration was certainly reasonably open. 

56It follows that I would not uphold ground two. 

Ground Three
""The learned sentencing judge erred in reaching a conclusion, beyond reasonable doubt, that the applicant actually entered the premises with a view to the sexual exploitation of the victim.""

Background and submissions

57In support of this ground, senior counsel for the applicant conceded that the acceptance by his Honour of the version given by the mother of the applicant of the conversation at the police station was open. However, in light of what the applicant said in that conversation, and having regard to all of the evidence, including what the applicant had said on oath, it was submitted that one could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, at the time he entered the home of the victim, the applicant had formed the intention of sexually assaulting the victim.

58Counsel for the respondent made a number of submissions in support of the proposition that the finding was reasonably open. First, the reason for entry given by the applicant to the effect that he thought something was wrong was spurious and liable to prompt rejection. Secondly, the victim was unaware of the presence of the applicant in her home at any stage prior to the commencement of the offences. Thirdly, the applicant left immediately after the conclusion of the offences. Fourthly, the applicant committed no other offences (such as stealing) whilst in the home of the victim. 

Decision

59I need not repeat the limited basis upon which factual findings of sentencing judges may be overturned by this Court. 

60To the factors identified by counsel for the respondent may be added that, in light of the untruths in the first ERISP, and repeated subsequent changes of the position of the applicant, his credibility by the time he gave evidence in the witness box was very substantially damaged.

61Again, I consider that it was well open to his Honour to make the finding under consideration. Accordingly, I would not uphold ground three.

Ground Four
""The sentencing judge placed undue weight on the objective circumstances of the offences.""

Background and submissions

62This ground as developed focussed on some of the words used by his Honour in the remarks on sentence. Particular reliance was placed on the following portions at pp 8, 15-16:

""One only has to read those facts out to be horrified and it is a fact that any right thinking member of the community would be thoroughly disgusted by the facts of this case.

...

...I have also noted in particular the photographs depicting the injuries to the victim and I must say the photographs on any view are disturbing. ... [I]t does seem to me that the injuries sustained by the victim go far beyond the threshold of what is necessary to constitute the particular offences.

...

I have had regard to the Victim Impact Statement and that was a statement read by the victim's granddaughter and I must say when it was read out I think that nobody who heard it could have been unaffected by it. It was extremely disturbing to hear how an eighty-three year old woman was traumatised by these offences and very disturbing indeed ... It seems to me looking at the matter this was a savage, callous and predatory attack upon an eighty-three year old in her own home ... The offender's conduct towards the victim was particularly degrading and he entered the premises for the very purpose of engaging in that conduct and sexually exploiting the frail woman of advanced years."" 

63Attention was drawn by senior counsel for the applicant to the fact that his Honour found that the offences were ""just below worst case category"".

64It was also mentioned that his Honour had said of the offences ""these are very serious offences that attract standard non-parole periods"". As for that portion of the remarks on sentence, it was submitted that, to the extent that there had been pleas of guilty in the matters, his Honour was not correct in stating that the offences attracted standard non-parole periods. 

65As I understand this ground, the complaint is that, with regard to the first two paragraphs extracted from the remarks on sentence, the language used by his Honour was intemperate and suggestive that, to quote the oral submissions:

""it indicates an undue weight, in the overall circumstances, on the objective circumstances"".

66Counsel for the respondent submitted that strong language was called for by the offences. She noted that the applicant himself, in denying the offences in the first ERISP, referred to the allegations as ""disgusting"". He used the same word in the witness box to describe the actions that by that stage he did not deny. 

Decision

67The submission discussed at [64] may be disposed of quickly. The offences indeed attracted standard non-parole periods by way of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999; the law at that time was that, because of the pleas of guilty, the sentencing did not call for their inflexible application. In any event, the whole flavour of the remarks on sentence demonstrates that his Honour was quite aware of the role of a standard non-parole period when there had been a plea of guilty. Finally, there is no substantial ground asserting error in the approach to the standard non-parole periods. I respectfully reject this submission. 

68As for the language used by his Honour, it is noteworthy that, in his own letter of apology tendered in the proceedings on sentence, the applicant himself referred to the ""terrible way I treated you"" and the ""pain and trauma"" and ""suffering"" of the victim. Furthermore, in oral submissions in this Court in support of this very ground, senior counsel for the applicant referred to ""the horror of what, undoubtedly, was a horrendous sequence of circumstances"". Those characterisations adopted by the applicant himself and his own counsel lend support to the proposition that the language used by his Honour cannot be the subject of effective complaint on his behalf.

69The general purpose of remarks on sentence is to explain to the offender and to the community what sentence is being imposed and why. There is no requirement that remarks on sentence be anodyne or mealy-mouthed. If an offence is trivial, or comically inept, a sentencing judge is surely entitled to say so in the remarks on sentence. Conversely, where, as here, a series of offences is so serious as to inspire severe condemnation, I do not consider that a sentencing judge should be prohibited from using strong, even powerful, language, although it should never become inflamed or inflammatory. A similar approach to the use of powerful language in appropriate circumstances in remarks on sentence was taken by this Court in the recent decision of Lobsey v R [2012] NSWCCA 239 at [20] - [21].

70In this case, every member of the Australian community would surely deplore the ordeal to which the applicant subjected an 83 year old woman in her own home. In describing what the applicant did to the victim that evening, one could expect such citizens to use language far more potent than the language used by his Honour. 

71I do not consider that the language used by his Honour establishes an intemperate failure to approach the sentencing exercise properly, or a misjudgment as to the objective seriousness of the offences committed.

72It follows that I would not uphold ground four.

Ground Five
""With respect to count 2 the sentencing judge erred in commencing the sentencing process as if the offence fell into the worst category.""

Background and submissions 

73This ground was not the subject of written or oral submissions by senior counsel for the applicant. Nor was it addressed in writing by counsel for the respondent.

74Accordingly, I consider that I should deal with it very briefly.

Decision

75As I understand the ground, unilluminated by submissions, it seems to be suggesting that, if one subtracts the discount that resulted in a head sentence of imprisonment for 13 years on count 2, one arrives at a starting point head sentence of 17 years 4 months. That is approaching the maximum penalty of imprisonment available of 20 years. In light of that position, the ground seems to be asserting that that starting point head sentence is not consistent with the finding of his Honour that the offences were just below the worst case. 

76In truth, therefore, ground five appears to be asserting that the head sentence imposed for count 2 is erroneously long. Accordingly, I shall deal with this particular argument when I come to consider ground six.

77I would not uphold ground five as a separate ground. 

Ground Six
""The effective sentences imposed are manifestly excessive.""

Background and submissions

78In written submissions, senior counsel for the applicant suggested that ""the effect of the partial accumulation was such as to produce an overall sentence which is manifestly excessive"". He invited attention to two decisions of this Court, both of which I will analyse shortly. 

79Senior counsel for the applicant submitted that, if this ground were made out, this Court ""ought to intervene and proceed to re-sentence an effective reduction in line with a disposition of the appeal"" as to the total sentence in one of those decisions. 

80Counsel for the respondent submitted that the degree of partial accumulation exhibited in this sentencing structure was open to the discretion of his Honour. She also submitted that the criminality encompassed by the offences called for condign punishment. She also referred to the very well-known principle to the effect that, in order to succeed in such a ground, an applicant must demonstrate not merely a severe sentence, but a sentence that is ""plainly unreasonable or unjust"": Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357.

Decision

81The applicant was sentenced for one explosion of criminality committed against one victim. No offence carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life. The offences of the applicant did not include homicide. He pleaded guilty at an early stage and was remorseful. He was 23 years old at the time of the offences. His criminal record, although lengthy, contained nothing approaching the seriousness of these offences; indeed, he had never been sentenced to imprisonment in a gaol before. In those circumstances, the imposition of a total head sentence of 16 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 11 years 6 months calls for careful consideration of this ground. 

82I shall first consider the sentences individually, then totality, and then the total sentence in itself.

83Again, I will deal with the sentences in the chronological order in which they appear in the sentence structure. All offences, it will be recalled, are the subject of the undisputed characterisation by his Honour that they were ""just below worst case"".

84It will be recalled that count 3 featured a head sentence of imprisonment of 10 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 6 years 6 months, in the context of a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years and a standard non-parole period of 7 years. The offence reflected the breaking and entering of the victim's house and the attempted penetration of the vagina of the victim with the penis of the applicant. That was attempted three or four times, and the victim felt the penis of the applicant press against her anus. The wounding was the circumstance of special aggravation. It will be recalled that the wounding was occasioned by way of the repeated bashing of the head of an elderly woman against a wall. Despite her request for her asthma inhaler, the applicant thereafter departed, leaving the victim bruised, bleeding, in great pain and struggling for breath.

85Taking everything into account, including of course the subjective features, I do not consider that sentence to be manifestly excessive.

86As for the sentence for count 1, it will be recalled that it consists of a head sentence of imprisonment for 12 years with a non-parole of imprisonment for 7 years 6 months. It was imposed in the context of a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years with a standard non-parole period of imprisonment for 10 years. It featured the digital penetration of the vagina of the victim in the context of the infliction of a very substantial amount of actual bodily harm.

87I do not consider that the sentence is manifestly excessive.

88As for count 2, it will be recalled that a head sentence of imprisonment for 13 years with a non-parole period of imprisonment for 8 years was imposed. That was in the context of a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years with a standard non-parole period of 10 years. 

89The sexual intercourse that founded the offence was penetration of the vagina by the penis of the applicant. It lasted for about 3 minutes. During the course of it, the applicant threatened the victim by way of claiming to have a knife (though his Honour was not satisfied that that was in fact the case). During the intercourse the victim was in pain, could feel her heart palpitating, and was struggling for breath. The applicant ejaculated inside her. The degradation of the victim was made more pronounced by the enquiry by the applicant as to whether she was enjoying the experience.

90As I have indicated with regard to this ground of appeal, I give consideration to the aspect that I understand is encapsulated in ground five. The head sentence is imprisonment for 13 years. Accordingly, when one adds on the discount for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty, the starting point, reflecting all the objective and subjective features of the matter, must have been 17 years 4 months. The maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years. The finding of his Honour was that the offence was just below the worst class of case. Those circumstances give rise to the question as to whether the starting point was too high.

91Two things may be said with regard to that. The first is that this Court has cautioned against an analysis of starting points in order to determine whether a sentence is manifestly excessive: see SZ v R [2007] NSWCCA 19; (2007) 168 A Crim R 249 at [40], Rutkowsky v R [2008] NSWCCA 10 at [10] and Yousef v R [2011] NSWCCA 104 at [30]. Instead, attention should be focussed upon the sentence actually imposed.

92But even proceeding to undertake the analysis about which caution has been expressed, I come to the conclusion that the starting point is indeed approaching the maximum penalty but not inappropriately so, in all of the circumstances of this case. 

93Considering the sentence as a whole, and leaving aside the analysis based on starting points, I do not consider that the sentence is manifestly excessive. 

94In short, I do not determine that any individual sentence is manifestly excessive.

95I now consider the question of totality, reflected by the sentence structure adopted by his Honour. I proceed from the foundational proposition that a degree of partial accumulation was undoubtedly open to the discretion of his Honour; the question is whether the extent of the accumulation in this case has resulted in a total head sentence or total non-parole period that is manifestly excessive.

96Turning to the details of the sentencing structure, it can be seen that relatively short periods of custody are solely referable to the offences other than count 2.

97The structure is that the period actually to be served in custody for count 3 is 18 months. The s 166 offence is wholly concurrent with count 3. The period actually to be served in custody with regard to count 1 is 2 years. None of those aspects of the structure can be impugned by the applicant. 

98The head sentence and non-parole period of count 2 are wholly cumulative on those two periods actually to be served. But they are, of course, substantially concurrent with the head sentences of both count 3 and count 1. 

99I do not consider that those periods of accumulation can found a finding that error is established. It follows that I would not uphold the ground on the basis of an erroneous failure to reflect the principle of totality. 

100I turn to the question of whether the total head sentence and total non-parole period are manifestly excessive. This was the focus of the oral and written submissions of senior counsel for the applicant. In particular he invited attention to two decisions of this Court: Brooks v R [2006] NSWCCA 169 and AA v R [2009] NSWCCA 109. Senior counsel did not provide this Court with any other materials, such as statistics, tables of cases at first instance or on appeal, case summaries, or further decisions of this Court, in support of this ground. 

101In Brooks v R, the offender pleaded guilty to a number of offences. They were an offence of aggravated break and enter and committing an indictable offence, namely, aggravated sexual intercourse without consent; aggravated sexual intercourse without consent; attempted aggravated sexual intercourse without consent; a further offence of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent; and aggravated robbery. Each offence carried a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 20 years. For the aggravated break and enter offence there was a standard non-parole period of 5 years, and for the aggravated sexual assaults there was a standard non-parole period of 10 years. There were also offences on a Form 1.

102Briefly, the offender broke into the home of an 82 year old woman. He terrified her with a spanner. He penetrated her vagina digitally and with his penis. It is not clear whether the offender ejaculated. He also performed cunnilingus and attempted to force the victim to perform fellatio. The offender robbed the victim. It was found by the sentencing judge that the initial intention was to steal, not to sexually assault.

103The offender in that matter was aged 18 years at the time of the offences. He was on parole, and another sentence had expired only days before. He had a bad criminal record. He had been sexually assaulted as a child. His older brother had committed suicide. The offender in that case was not remorseful. His sentence was to be served on protection. A discount of 20 per cent was applied for the utilitarian value of pleas of guilty. At first instance an total head sentence of imprisonment for 17 years was imposed with an total non-parole period of imprisonment for 13 years.

104On appeal, a ground founded on the characterisation by the sentencing judge at first instance that the offences fell into the worst class of case was upheld. The aggregate sentence was reduced, with the result that there was a total head sentence of imprisonment for 14 years with a total non-parole period of 10 years 6 months. That was the result for which senior counsel for the applicant contended in this appeal in his written submissions.

105In some ways, the position of the applicant was more favourable than that of Brooks. In the case of the applicant, there was no robbery; there was no use of a weapon (although there was the threat thereof); the applicant had a less serious criminal record; there was a finding of remorse; and there was (one can assume from the discount given to Brooks) an earlier plea of guilty.

106In other ways, the position of the applicant was less favourable than that of Brooks. The applicant was aged 23, as opposed to 18, as at the date of the offences; he committed an offence carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years; he inflicted severe physical violence upon the victim above and beyond the violence inherent in the sexual offences; he intended to commit sexual offences at the time of entry, as opposed to opportunistically forming that intention later; his subjective features were less compelling; and there were prior offences that were found to have a sexual flavour.

107The exercise of comparing and contrasting the matter under consideration with the appeal in Brooks v R, with particular regard to the total head sentence and total non-parole period imposed on Brooks, does not persuade me that the total head sentence and non-parole period imposed upon the applicant are manifestly excessive.

108In AA v R, the offender detained and sexually assaulted a 32 year old woman in her car. There were two offences of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent, the circumstance of aggravation being the use of a knife to threaten to inflict actual bodily harm. Each of those offences carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years with a standard non-parole period of 10 years. There was also an offence of armed carjacking. That offence carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years and a standard non-parole period of 5 years. There was also an offence of detaining with intent to obtain an advantage, which carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years. 

109A knife was used to effect the offences, and at times it was held firmly to the throat of the victim. There was digital penetration of the vagina of the victim, and penile penetration with ejaculation. It was found that, at the time he entered the vehicle, the offender intended to commit sexual offences.

110When he departed, the offender implicitly threatened the victim with death if she informed the authorities of his offences. 

111The offender in AA v R was not yet 17 at the time of the offences. He entered an early plea of guilty, after having been served with DNA evidence. He had a bad record, including a previous matter of sexual intercourse without consent. His childhood had been marred by domestic violence and, at the age of 4, seeing his father commit suicide by way of a shotgun blast to the head. He suffered from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and had low cognitive function. He was not found to be remorseful, on the basis that his level of functioning did not permit him to fully appreciate the gravity of what he had done. 

112A ground founded upon the proposition that the total head sentence of imprisonment for 13 years with a total non-parole period of imprisonment for 9 years was manifestly excessive did not find favour in this Court. 

113Again, in some ways the position of the applicant was more favourable than the position of AA. The applicant used no weapon; there was no threat of death; and the applicant had a less serious record. In other ways, the position of the applicant was worse: the applicant was substantially older than AA; the subjective circumstances of the applicant were less compelling; the victim of the applicant was more vulnerable; the offences were committed in the home of the victim; and finally, severe violence was visited upon an elderly and frail woman.

114Again, comparing of all of the salient aspects of the matter under consideration with the judgment in AA v R, and focussing in particular on the total head sentence and total non-parole period, I do not come to the conclusion that the total head sentence and aggregate non-parole period imposed in this matter are manifestly excessive. 

115Speaking generally, it is not easy for this Court to seek to construe whether a sentence is manifestly excessive by comparison to one or two other cases that bear some objective or subjective similarities to the matter under appeal: see R v George [2004] NSWCCA 247; (2004) 149 A Crim R 38. All cases turn on their own facts, and, as in the examples discussed here, there will be factors that point towards or away from a greater or lesser sentence. What needs to be shown by an applicant with regard to this ground is that the sentence is so far outside the range available to the discretion of the sentencing judge as to be clearly wrong. It is not easy for this Court to be satisfied of such a proposition on the basis of two other cases. 

116Finally, although counsel for the respondent submitted that it was not appropriate, I consider that it is useful, in evaluating whether the total head sentence and non-parole period are manifestly excessive, to consider what the total head sentence and total non-parole period would have been if there had been a trial. That cannot be worked out mathematically, because the starting point reflects the finding of remorse, which would almost certainly have been absent if a trial had taken place. Nevertheless, if there had been a trial, I consider that it is useful to reflect on a total head sentence in the order of 22 years with a total non-parole period in the order of 15 years 6 months. Would such sentences have been appropriate in the circumstances? Apart from anything else, such a trial would have involved an 84 year old witness re-living the events of that evening. 

117A hypothetical total sentence of that length would undoubtedly have been a heavy one. But the criminality to which it would have related was extreme. And the fact is that this Court does not shy away from the imposition of very lengthy sentences for offences of sexual violence of great brutality: see Haines v R [2012] NSWCCA 238. Ultimately, I am not satisfied that such a hypothetical sentence demonstrates that the total head sentence or total non-parole period actually imposed in this case is manifestly excessive.

118In short, I am not persuaded that any individual sentence is manifestly excessive; or that totality is erroneously reflected in the sentence structure; or that the total head sentence or total non-parole period actually imposed is manifestly excessive, whether by way of the comparisons with two other cases that senior counsel for the applicant invited this Court to undertake, or by way of consideration of the ""starting point"". 

119It follows that I would not uphold ground six.

Orders

120I propose the following orders:

(1)Leave to appeal granted.

(2)Appeal dismissed.

		04 February 2013",2013-02-03 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2707199,R v Abdollahi (No 1) [2013] NSWSC 474,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: Thirteen accused stand trial for alleged offences of riot and affray said to have been committed when they were detainees in the Fowler Compound at the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre (""VIDC"") on 20-21 April 2011. It is the Crown case that there was a violent disturbance involving threats to staff and considerable damage to property, including by fire. The Crown claims it can identify the accused as having been involved in the disturbance up to a certain point but wishes to lead evidence of events subsequent to that point when the worst of the property damage occurred. The defence object to that evidence of subsequent events. In my view, such evidence is inadmissible. 

The scene

2The VIDC comprised a number of compounds. The focus of events concerning the accused is upon the Fowler Compound in which they were being detained. The Fowler Compound adjoined the Hughes Compound. There was fencing that separated the two. There was perimeter fencing that surrounded both. Kitchen and medical centre buildings were outside the individual compounds but within the external perimeter fencing. It is unnecessary to refer to another compound that comprised the VIDC except to say that it was entirely separate from Fowler and Hughes.

3Fowler and Hughes each comprised a number of buildings that surrounded a recreational courtyard that, in Fowler, comprised a soccer field and basketball area. The buildings included some for accommodation, others for recreation (for example, a gymnasium and a library) and others for utilitarian purposes (for example, an office and interview rooms).

4The Australian government had contracted out the task of staffing the VIDC to a company called Serco Immigration Services (""Serco""). I gather that the task of Serco staff included looking after the daily needs of inmates as well as providing for the physical and operational security of the VIDC.

The disturbance

5The disturbance commenced early in the day on 20 April 2011 when two detainees were seen to be on the roof of one of the buildings in the Fowler compound (the Macquarie Building). There followed a number of events throughout the day and into the evening. Further detainees made their way onto the roof. Roof tiles were thrown to the ground and in the direction of Serco staff or specific infrastructure such as interview rooms. Some of the detainees on the ground are alleged to have been aggressive towards Serco staff. 

6Staff began removing from the Fowler Compound those detainees who did not wish to be involved in the disturbance. Other detainees continued to become more agitated. Roof tiles continued to be thrown from the roof of the Macquarie Building. Staff retreated to the office area within the compound (the Murray Unit). One of the detainees on the roof is alleged to have been shouting ""Fuck Serco"" and ""Freedom"". Another was yelling ""Fuck you. Fuck your mothers. Fuck your sisters. Fuck immigration"". Wheelie bins were set on fire. Fire extinguishers were emptied of their contents and thrown away, some in the direction of staff. Soccer goal posts were dismantled and put on a fire on the soccer field. 

7One detainee was seen to throw a fire extinguisher through the Murray office window. Another threw a piece of burning wood into the window causing the office to catch fire. It was at about this point that Serco staff were evacuated from the Fowler Compound. This was at about 11.15pm to 11.20pm.

8It is unnecessary for present purposes to go into any further detail about the events the Crown alleges occurred during the course of this disturbance. The foregoing is merely intended to provide the flavour of it.

9At the time of the evacuation, there were a number of fires within the Fowler Compound. Further fires were set following the evacuation. About an hour or so later unidentified detainees broke down the fence and entered the Hughes Compound. There, and also in the medical centre and kitchen buildings, occurred further fires and other property damage. 

10The evacuation of the Serco staff brought an end to any ability for identification of who did what in the events that followed with the exception of one of the accused, namely Majid Parhizkar. 

11The evidence of property damage, including by arson, that occurred after the evacuation is substantial and dramatic. Video footage obtained from a police helicopter and from a television station shows raging fires. Photographs of the aftermath show the large extent of the damage. However, much of this is unable to be attributed by the Crown to any of the accused (aside from Mr Parhizkar).

The objection

12An objection has been made to the Crown leading any evidence of events subsequent to the point at which the accused can be identified as being involved in disturbance. It is contended that if the evidence has any probative value at all, which is not conceded, it is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused. 

Reasons for upholding the objection 

13The Crown does not rely upon any of the subsequent events to identify any of the accused as having been involved in the preceding events. It is only the evidence of the preceding events that can, potentially, inculpate the accused for the crimes with which they stand charged. 

14One of the elements of the offence of riot is that there was a common purpose for which 12 or more persons present together used or threatened unlawful violence. Theoretically, at least, it may be that the evidence of subsequent events might inform the jury's consideration of the nature and extent of the common purpose of the detainees of the VIDC who were involved in what I have called ""the disturbance"". If so, it would be relevant and therefore admissible, but subject to the requirement to exclude evidence if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of its unfair prejudice to the accused: s 137 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). 

15In the circumstances I have outlined above, the evidence is limited in any such potential relevance to establishing (potentially) a common purpose of a large group of detainees. It says nothing about whether any of the accused (with the possible exception of the accused Parhizkar) shared that common purpose. So, I have grave doubts about whether the evidence meets the first test posed by s 56 of the Evidence Act. 

16Even if the evidence was relevant, with the inability of the Crown to establish the involvement of any of the accused (aside from the possible exception of Mr Parhizkar) in any of the events subsequent to the staff evacuation from Fowler, the substantial nature of the rampage and the property damage that occurred from that point means, in my view, that the accused would be unfairly prejudiced if such evidence was to be admitted. The evidence could impermissibly influence the jury to consider that the accused were responsible for a far more significant disturbance and substantial property damage than that which they can be shown to have been involved in, even taking the Crown case at its highest. 

17I note that the Crown Prosecutor indicated during the course of submissions that if I was to exclude evidence of the events subsequent to the staff evacuation in relation to 12 of the accused, the Crown would not seek to lead any evidence of the involvement of Mr Parhizkar in those events. Whilst such evidence might be relevant to the state of mind of Mr Parhizkar prior to the evacuation, it was acknowledged that such evidence would be unduly prejudicial in relation to the other accused (T245).

18I conclude that all evidence of events subsequent to the evacuation of Serco staff from the Fowler Compound is inadmissible. This does not mean that evidence derived subsequent to that time is excluded. Evidence derived at a subsequent time, which clearly bears upon events which must have been in existence, or initiated, at around or prior to that time (for example, video footage recorded after the evacuation of fires set at around or before the time of evacuation) is not excluded.

A consequence of this ruling

19This ruling will mean that the jury will be left wondering what happened after the staff evacuation from Fowler. They will be aware that some detainees were still on the roof of the Macquarie Building and that others were continuing the disturbance on the ground in that compound. They will no doubt wonder what happened to bring the disturbance to an end. There was some discussion about this aspect during the course of submissions. It seems to me that it would be appropriate, indeed necessary, to convey to the jury in some fashion that the disturbance continued for some time after the evacuation but because of the absence of staff, the Crown is not in a position to attribute blame to any individual, accused or otherwise. It will be necessary to direct the jury that events subsequent to the evacuation have no bearing upon their consideration of the charges brought against any of the accused.
