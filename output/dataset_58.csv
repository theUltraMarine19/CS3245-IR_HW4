GROUNDS OF DECISION
Synopsis
The accused Tan Nguan Siah who was 38 years of age at the time of his arrest was tried before me initially on the following charge:
That you, TAN NGUAN SIAH, on or about the 5th day of March 1991 at about 5.05 pm at Changi Road, Singapore, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class A of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185, to wit, 118 packets of substance containing not less than 46.56 grams of diamorphine which were in your possession at Changi Road, Singapore, without any authorisation under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby, by virtue of section 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, committed an offence under section 5(a) and punishable under section 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
2 The accused did not deny having the prohibited substance in his possession but claimed in the main that except for four packets < which contained about 1.92g of diamorphine > which were meant for sale that evening, the remainder was for his consumption. He maintained that out of the 118 packets seized from him, 62 packets < containing 29.47g of diamorphine > were bought by him just that evening from one of his contacts for his personal consumption. He claimed that he was an addict and it was his habit to carry the drugs around since the rented room he was occupying was not a safe place to store those drugs.
3 At the close of the whole case the learned DPP applied to amend the charge by which the amount of diamorphine said to be trafficked in was reduced from 46.56 to 46.43g and correspondingly the number of packets was also reduced from 118 to 117 packets. < Emphasis added. > All other features of the charge remained unaltered. There was no objection to the proposed amendment and there was no application for any witnesses to be recalled. In the event, the accused was found guilty of the amended charge and was sentenced to death. My reasons follow.
Prosecution evidence
4 The prosecution's case was that on 5 March 1991 at about 5.05pm, the accused was seen standing with a black plastic bag at a bus stop along Changi Road. PC Zakaria Bin Ahmad (PW-10) who was patrolling that sector in a police patrol car with National Service Police Inspector (NSPI) Ang Thiam Soon (PW-9) and Corporal Panneerchelvam s/o Solomon (PW-11) stopped the vehicle and checked the accused. The plastic bag the accused carried contained a substantial sum of money and numerous packets of white powdery substance which PC Zakaria suspected as heroin. On examination the contents of the plastic bag revealed:
(1) A Marlboro cigarette box wrapped with Chinese newspaper containing 62 packets of white powdery substance; 
(2) S$6,200;
(3) Red coloured plastic bag (Ming Ming Optical Co); 
(4) Red coloured paper bag (Bee Cheng Hiang Hup Chong Foodstuff Pte Ltd); 
(5) 1 newspaper-wrapped bundle containing 8 packets of white powdery substance;
(6) 1 newspaper-wrapped bundle containing 14 packets of white powdery substance; 
(7) 1 red polythene bag containing 29 packets of white powdery substance; and 
(8) 1 newspaper-wrapped bundle containing 4 packets of white powdery substance.
In addition to the above the accused also had in his shirt pocket 1 `ang pow' packet containing a packet of white powdery substance, a stick and an empty straw.
5 The accused was eventually brought to Geylang Police Station where he was questioned by SNO Chow Toong Chee (PW-12) as to the contents of the plastic bag. The accused admitted that the bag contained `Peh Hoon' which is the Hokkien equivalent for heroin.
6 All the 118 packets of the white powdery substance were sent to the Department of Scientific Services for analysis and the certificates (six in number) issued by Dr Saw Chwee Guan, established that the powdery substance contained a total of 46.56g of diamorphine. The breakdown according to the said six certificates is as follows:

7 NSPI Ang whose depositional evidence was admitted as PS-22 without objection gave oral testimony. He said that when the accused was picked up at Changi Road, he was brought into the rear seat of the police vehicle and was questioned by PC Zakaria. NSPI Ang said that he acted as an interpreter and interpreted to the accused in Hokkien the questions that were put to the accused by PC Zakaria and the replies given by the accused were in turn interpreted in English by him to PC Zakaria. NSPI Ang said that he did not record those questions and answers in his pocket book.
8 It should be observed at this juncture that before the above verbal questions and answers were admitted in evidence, the Court invited the DPP to submit as to whether such verbals were admissible in evidence for it appeared on the face of it that the person who asked the questions and obtained the answers was PC Zakaria who was an officer below the rank of a Sergeant. The DPP then addressed the Court on the wording of s 122(5) of the CPC which amongst other things provided that any statement (by an accused) `in the hearing of any police officer of or above the rank of Sergeant shall be admissible at his trial.' He said that since NSPI Ang who acted as the interpreter is a police officer above the rank of a Sergeant such statements given in his hearing were admissible. Defence counsel did not join issue with the DPP's submissions based on s 122(5) of the CPC. The verbals thus admitted as part of NSPI Ang's deposition read as follows:
Q : Whether he was the seller or buyer?
A : Seller. 
Q : Where he got the drug?
A : From a Malaysian.
Q : What is the Malaysian's name?
A : Don't know. 
Q : Selling to who?
A : Sell to whoever called me. 
Q : Where he got the money from? 
A : From the sale of the drug.
9 NSPI Ang was cross-examined fairly intensively. It was suggested to him that the five questions and answers were part of a larger conversation that took place that day. NSPI Ang agreed with that suggestion. He also admitted that he did not at the time of questioning realise the significance of the questions and answers and therefore it did not occur to him to have them recorded. He conceded that he could not remember the actual words employed when questioning the accused and the words used by the accused in giving his answers. Neither could he remember the actual sequence. He maintained however that he could recall the said questions and answers some 13 days later when he was interviewed by the Investigating Officer, NO Soh Koh Tong (PW-13) in the recording of his statement.
10 NO Soh's evidence, quite apart from its formal aspects, touched upon the raid conducted by his team of officers at about 6.15pm on 7 March 1991 on the accused's rented room at No 16 Geylang Lorong 38. There he seized a small cardboard box (marked `physeptone') containing two packets (sachets) of granular substance and the identity card of the accused. The raiding party also discovered a bundle of empty plastic packets (exh P-48). NO Soh also said in evidence that when the accused was under his charge between 6 and 20 March 1991 the accused never complained to him of any illness or discomfort and had that been the case he would have sent the accused to Changi Prison Hospital for treatment.
11 No Soh confirmed that the two urine samples taken from the accused after his arrest proved to be positive in that morphine was detected.
Submission of no case to answer
12 At the close of the prosecution's case counsel submitted that the prosecution had not made out a case against the accused. He contended that the presumption contained in s 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Ch 185) (`the Act') is a rebuttable one. The mainstay of his submission was that trafficking was an overt act and the prosecution, inasmuch as it had omitted to prove any overt act on the part of the accused, had failed to establish an essential ingredient of the charge. In this regard counsel relied on Seow Koon Guan v Public Prosecutor < 1978 > 2 MLJ 45 which, counsel submitted, supported his proposition that mere possession of a controlled drug for the purpose of trafficking therein did not constitute the doing of an act for the purpose of trafficking therein.
Reply by DPP at the close of prosecution case
13 The DPP in her reply submitted that the prosecution had proved that the accused was in possession of 46.56g of diamorphine and by virtue of s 18(2) of the Act, the accused was deemed to have known the nature of the drug. The DPP added that the fact of possession having been proved, s 17 of the Act which is averred to in the charge, came into play and the accused is presumed to be trafficking in diamorphine.
Prima facie case
14 Section 17 of the Act in its present form contains an amendment to the old law and came into effect on 15 February 1990. It reads:
17. Any person who is proved to have had in his possession more than - 
(a) 100 grammes of opium;
(b) 3 grammes of morphine; 
(c) 2 grammes of diamorphine; 
(d) 15 grammes of cannabis;
(e) 10 grammes of cannabis resin; or (f) 3 grammes of cocaine, whether or not contained in any substance, extract, preparation or mixture shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to traffic in that controlled drug.
The amendment introduces a rebuttable presumption concerning trafficking in a number of controlled drugs under which anyone who is proved to be in possession of more than a stipulated quantity shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to traffic in that drug. The amendment was clearly intended to overcome the shortcomings highlighted in the observations of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Poon Soh Har & Anor v Public Prosecutor < 1977 > 2 MLJ 126 where Choor Singh J observed at page 128:
It seems to us that the trial judges equated the phrase ""have had such controlled drug in his possession for the purposes of trafficking"" in section 15 of the Act with the word ""traffic"". To possess a drug for the purpose of trafficking therein, is, as already pointed out, something totally different from the act of ""trafficking"" as defined in section 2 of the Act. In our judgment the words of section 15 are clear and unambiguous. If Parliament had intended that the presumption should be that the possessor was trafficking in the drug possessed, it would have used the words ""traffic in such controlled drug"" instead of the words ""have had such controlled drug in his possession for the purpose of trafficking."" < Emphasis added. > 
15 The phraseology of the amended s 17 of the Act is unambiguous and in fact requires no legislative history to interpret its meaning and purport. It provides that once a person is proved to have had in his possession more than 2g of diamorphine, he is presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have trafficked in a controlled drug. The presumption itself is well justified on the ground that the harm and damage caused by purveyors of drugs is so great and proof of trafficking so difficult to establish that the law must shift the burden to the accused (see Evidence by Prof Chin Tet Yung at page 150). The phrase `until the contrary is proved' appearing in s 17 of the Act shifts the burden to the accused to prove on balance of probabilities that he was not trafficking in diamorphine. It is therefore in my view unnecessary to prove any overt act on the part of the accused person. The reliance on Seow Koon Guan's case (supra) by counsel was therefore misplaced in view of the 1990 amendments to s 17 of the Act. Having therefore considered all the undisputed evidence, I held that a case had been made out by the prosecution which, if unrebutted, would warrant the conviction of the accused. The standard allocution was administered and the accused elected to give evidence on affirmation.
Defence evidence
16 The main aspects of the accused's evidence are these. The accused was a drug addict. He was detained at the Drug Rehabilitation Centre (DRC) in 1978 and was placed under police supervision in September 1990. Just about ten days after his release in September 1990 he started consuming heroin.
17 At the initial stages, his consumption was only half a small packet of heroin a day but as days went by he increased his consumption to two packets a day.
18 Prior to his arrest he was staying in a rented room in Geylang. At the time of his arrest he was employed at a gambling den, earning about $80 to $100 a day. He also made money by gambling and from his earnings spent between $70 and $80 a day on heroin. He admitted carrying the drugs in the plastic bag found in his possession on 5 March 1991. Of the drugs found, 62 packets were bought by him from a Malaysian by the name of Ah Lee just minutes prior to his arrest on 5 March 1991. He paid $5,000 for those drugs. This sum of $5,000 came partly from his savings, partly from monies he had won at gambling sessions and partly from the sale of drugs by him to others. He emphasised that whatever sale he had made in the past did not at any given time exceed four packets.
19 On the day and time of his arrest, he was waiting at the bus stop to sell four packets of heroin to a person whom he knew as Ang but before he could meet up with Ang, he was arrested.
20 He asserted that out of the 118 packets found on him, 62 packets were fresh purchases, one for his consumption and four for sale. He carried the remainder in the bay because the rented room where he slept was not a safe place to store them since his landlady had a key to that room. Furthermore the room had no other furniture apart from the beddings and an electric fan.
21 As to the sum of $6,200 found inside the bag, the accused claimed that sum was borrowed by him from people at the gambling den to meet the funeral expenses of his sister who had passed away on 4 March 1991. Another sum of $1,600 that was also found on him was attributed by him to be a repayment of a loan by one of his friends. As to the other sums found with him, he accounted that a sum of $296 was the balance of monies after he had paid off Ah Lee for the 62 packets of heroin; a sum of M$200 was won by him at a gambling session and a 10,000 Japanese Yen note was acquired by him from someone sometime ago.
22 He said that after his arrest at Changi Road he was questioned in Malay by a Malay police officer (referring to PC Zakaria). The questions were in relation to his identity card and as to the contents of the plastic bag. He could not recall what was asked but was certain that he was not asked whether he was a seller or a buyer. He was also not asked as to where he obtained the money from. He claimed that the Chinese police officer (referring to NSPI Ang) did not ask him any questions.
23 A statement given by the accused under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Ch 68) to NO Soh was tendered by him in evidence. The statement thus admitted (exh D-5) reads as follows: The heroin was for my own consumption and I also sell heroin to sustain my drug addiction. I plead for leniency. (signed) (signed) (signed)
He asserted that though he sold drugs, he had never done so in large quantities and never exceeded 15g at any given time as he knew that such sale attracted the death penalty. He claimed that he made $40 to $50 profit from the sale of one packet.
24 In cross-examination the accused said that prior to his arrest he used to smoke more than 30 sticks of cigarettes spiked with heroin each day. The amount of drugs used to spike those 30 sticks was about two packets. He claimed that he was an addict and needed to smoke heroin constantly otherwise he would suffer from withdrawal symptoms. He explained that if he did not consume the next stick of heroin within an hour he would feel cold; if there was no consumption for two hours he would have cold sweat and running nose; if there was an interval of ten hours, he would feel weak, have cold sweat, running nose and feel feverish; and if there was no consumption for 20 hours he would suffer additionally stomach ache, feel weak and have diarrhoea. He added that if no heroin was available he would resort to a pill sold in dispensaries for some provisional comfort.
25 He said that after his arrest when he was sent to the lock-up he had all the symptoms which he described. But when he requested the CNB officers to send him to the Changi Prison Hospital, he was told that his stay at that hospital would result in his being handcuffed to the bed - a thought which dissuaded him from pursuing his request. He asserted that he had witnesses to confirm his withdrawal symptoms at the lock-up. He claimed that the officer who mentioned handcuffing was known to him as one `Loh Kok Wah'.
26 When pressed in cross-examination as to the identity of the CNB officer who mentioned the aspect of handcuffing at Changi Prison Hospital, the accused mentioned the name of NO Soh and after some uncertainty, pointed to Tan Geck Hong (PW-6) as one of the persons. A recurring element in his defence was that he was a drug addict and the drug found in his possession on that day was substantially for his consumption save for four packets which he was going to dispose of that day. The accused admitted that the bundle of empty plastic packets (exh P-48) found in his room were meant to be used for repacking the drugs into smaller packets.
27 A number of witnesses were called by the defence to substantiate that the accused was a drug addict. Dr Leow Kee Fong (DW-2) confirmed that the accused was detained at the DRC first in April 1978 and later in April and September 1979. Dr Leow confirmed that the withdrawal symptoms an addict would suffer include yawning, tearing, running nose, insomnia, cold sweat, stomach cramps, vomitting and diarrhoea.
28 Dr Lee Tong Kooi (DW-3) a Scientific Officer from the Department of Scientific Services testified that the analysis of the urine sample taken from the accused showed that it was consistent with the accused having consumed diamorphine.
29 Dr Chui Wai Yee (DW-4) another Scientific Officer attached to the Department of Scientific Services also testified that her analysis too confirmed that the urine sample of the accused contained morphine.
30 Tan Song Chua (DW-5), the brother of the accused testified to the effect that he suspected the accused of having resumed the consumption of heroin after his release from detention.
31 The other witnesses Chin Mun Wah (DW-6), Ong Cheng Chua (DW-7) and Yeoh Tiong Ghee (DW-8) all testified that the accused appeared to have been suffering from withdrawal symptoms when he was brought into the lock-up in March 1991.
32 Tan Geck Hong was recalled by the prosecution to give evidence in rebuttal. He denied that the accused told him of his withdrawal symptoms. He further denied that he told the accused that he would be handcuffed at the Changi Prison Hospital.
Closing submission by the defence
33 Mr Ang for the accused in his closing submission urged the Court to accept the accused's evidence that though he was in possession of 118 packets of drugs containing 46.56g of diamorphine, 62 packets which contained 29.47g of diamorphine were bought for his consumption only five minutes prior to his arrest. Of the balance, one packet which was in a red `ang pow' packet found in the shirt pocket of the accused containing 0.13g of diamorphine together with a straw and a stick was for the accused's own consumption. From the remainder, ie, 55 packets containing 16.96g of diamorphine, four packets (P-15/B4A) amounting to 1.92g were for sale to one Ang that day. Counsel submitted that it was beyond dispute that the accused was a drug addict having been detained at the DRC on a number of occasions. This was further fortified by the fact that the urine samples taken from him immediately after his arrest revealed traces of morphine. He added that the drug addiction of the accused was substantial to the point that he was suffering from acute withdrawal symptoms at the lock-up as had been confirmed by a number of inmates. Counsel also placed reliance on the s 122(6) statement of the accused in which he had stated that the heroin found in the plastic bag was meant for his own consumption and that he sold the heroin to sustain his drug addiction.
34 Counsel invited the Court to disregard the evidence of NSPI Ang as respects a number of questions posed by him at the behest of PC Zakaria and the purported answers from the accused. The attack on the verbals was on two fronts. Firstly counsel submitted that those verbals were not arranged in sequence and therefore gave a wrong flavour of the answers given. Secondly that those questions and answers were not promptly recorded by NSPI Ang after the occurrence but were narrated by him 13 days later.
35 As to the substantial sums of money found in the accused's possession, counsel's submission was that of the sum found, $6,200 could be clearly attributed to the accused borrowing money on account of his sister's funeral. In this regard, he relied on the evidence of his brother, Tan Song Chua who said that the accused had earlier told him that he was going to borrow some money for his sister's funeral.
36 Counsel contended that inasmuch as the proposed sale of the four packets amounting to 1.92g did not materialise, no trafficking was done or proved and what had been proved by the prosecution so far was only possession by the accused of 46.56g of diamorphine and nothing more. Counsel urged the Court to accept the defence version that the accused retained a substantial quantity of the drug as a reserve for his daily consumption and the fact it was kept in a plastic bag and was being carried by the accused at the time of his arrest should not be construed as trafficking within the meaning of s 5(a) of the Act. Counsel further submitted that since no overt act had been proved, the prosecution had failed to prove a charge of trafficking against the accused person.
DPP's final speech and amendment to the charge
37 The learned DPP Miss Koh in her final speech submitted that possession of 46.56g of diamorphine had been proved by the prosecution by virtue of ss 17 and 18(2) of the Act. She contended that the burden has shifted to the accused that he was trafficking in diamorphine and it was for him to rebut, on a balance of probabilities, the presumption under s 17. She however conceded that out of the total of 46.56g of diamorphine, 0.13g of diamorphine found in a single packet along with a straw and kept in his front pocket was for his consumption. Consequently the charge against the accused was amended to read that the accused trafficked in 117 packets containing not less than 46.43g of diamorphine. < Emphasis added. > The amended charge was read and an opportunity was given to the accused to recall any witnesses. There being no objection to the proposed amendment and no request for the recall of any witnesses, the Court went on to consider the submissions of the DPP on the amended charge.
Conclusion
38 Proof of the purpose for which an act is done had always presented a problem in criminal proceedings. In this context, it pays to quote Lord Diplock in Ong Ah Chuan v Public Prosecutor < 1981 > 1 MLJ 64 at page 69 where he said: `Generally, in the absence of an express admission by the accused, the purpose with which he did an act is a matter of inference from what he did. Thus, in the case of an accused caught in the act of conveying from one place to another controlled drugs in a quantity much larger than is likely to be needed for his own consumption the inference that he was transporting them for the purpose of trafficking in them would, in the absence of any plausible explanation by him, be irresistible - even if there were no statutory presumption < s > ... As a matter of common sense the larger the quantity of drugs involved the stronger the inference that they were not intended for the personal consumption of the person carrying them, and the more convincing the evidence needed to rebut it.'
39 In reviewing the evidence presented by the prosecution and the defence, I had little doubt in my mind that the accused was indeed an addict and that he was suffering from withdrawal symptoms at the lock-up. I also concluded that the evidence of NSPI Ang as regards certain admissions by the accused in the police vehicle could not be relied upon as they were recalled many days later and that the sequence of the questions and answers was probably not recorded in the order in which they were given. I also gave the benefit of the doubt to the accused that the sum of $6,200 found in his possession in the plastic bag on that day was a loan obtained by him from his friends to meet the funeral expenses of his deceased sister. However his explanation that he was in the habit of carrying the drugs with him all the time as he could not retain them in his rented room was disbelieved by me. In this context it should be noted that a total of 118 plastic packets of drugs were found in his possession and except for one sachet which was kept in his shirt pocket (shown as B4A in photograph P-6) for consumption, the remainder was wrapped or bundled in five groups as follows:
(a) 62 plastic packets wrapped in newspapers kept inside a Marlboro cigarette box (the newspapers which were used as wrappers were dated 23 February and 3 March 1991 shown as A1 in photograph P-2); (b) 8 plastic packets wrapped in a newspaper - Lian He Zao Bao dated 22 February 1991 (shown as B2 in photograph P-6); (c) 14 packets wrapped in a newspaper - Lian He Zao Bao dated 22 February 1991 (shown as B3 in photograph P-6); (d) 29 packets wrapped in a plastic polythene bag (shown as B4 in photograph P-6); and (e) 4 packets wrapped in a newspaper allegedly meant for sale to one Ang (shown as B4A in photograph P-6).
40 When asked by the Court why there were four separate bundles of 8, 14, 29 and 4 packets, (leaving aside the 62 packets) when, after all, he was going to sell to Ang that evening only the bundle containing four packets, the answers the accused gave were somewhat ambivalent. In my view the division of the drugs into four separate groups did not support his defence that the remainder was for his consumption. If the remainder was indeed for his personal use there was no necessity for them to be packed separately as had been done.
41 As to the nature of the drug found in the possession of the accused there was in fact no dispute. Apart from the prosecution's reliance on s 18(2) of the Act which provides that any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have known the nature of the drug, it was the evidence of the accused himself that he knew the nature of the drug he was carrying.
42 Now reverting to the presumption contained under s 17, the law as enacted makes it clear that so long as a person is proved to have in his possession more than 2g of diamorphine, until the contrary is proved, he shall be presumed to traffic in that controlled drug. The accused's explanation that he was carrying the drugs for a limited purpose of selling only four packets and the remainder being for his consumption, was not accepted by me. In my view, the accused has not proved the contrary on a balance of probabilities. Granting that he is an addict, his course of conduct on the day in question in fact pointed to the opposite direction that he was at Changi Road to sell the drugs in his possession save for that one packet which was found in his shirt pocket. The fact that the accused did not bring about his intended object to fruition is irrelevant in the scheme of the Misuse of Drugs Act. He was therefore found guilty of the amended charge and convicted accordingly.",1993-03-30 00:00:00,SG High Court
